Nevertheless, they still suffer from inherent limitations in resource efficiency, context management, and multimodal perception. Based on these observations, Lemon Agent is introduced, a multi-agent orchestrator-worker system built on a newly proposed AgentCortex framework, which formalizes the classic Planner-Executor-Memory paradigm through an adaptive task execution mechanism. Our system integrates a hierarchical self-adaptive scheduling mechanism that operates at both the overall orchestrator layer and workers layer. This mechanism can dynamically adjust computational intensity based on task complexity. It enables orchestrator to allocate one or more workers for parallel subtask execution, while workers can further improve operational efficiency by invoking tools concurrently. By virtue of this two-tier architecture, the system achieves synergistic balance between global task coordination and local task execution, thereby optimizing resource utilization and task processing efficiency in complex scenarios. To reduce context redundancy and increase information density during parallel steps, we adopt a three-tier progressive context management strategy. To make fuller use of historical information, we propose a self-evolving memory system, which can extract multi-dimensional valid information from all historical experiences to assist in completing similar tasks. Furthermore, we provide an enhanced MCP toolset. Empirical evaluations on authoritative benchmarks demonstrate that our Lemon Agent can achieve a state-of-the-art 91.36% overall accuracy on GAIA and secures the top position on the xbench-DeepSearch leaderboard with a score of 77+.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Lemon Agent \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c

Existing methods lack principled mechanisms to detect or prevent such failures. To address this gap, we first propose a hierarchical metric that quantifies behavioral uncertainty at three levels: intra-agent (individual reasoning uncertainty), inter-agent (interactive uncertainty), and system-level (output uncertainty). Empirical analysis across several benchmarks reveals that our proposed uncertainty quantification reliably indicates system failures, which demonstrates the validity of using them as diagnostic metrics to indicate the system failure. Subsequently, we propose a mitigation strategy by formulating an uncertainty-driven policy optimization to penalize self-contradiction, peer conflict, and low-confidence outputs in a dynamic debating environment. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed uncertainty-driven mitigation reliably calibrates the multi-agent system by consistently improving decision accuracy while reducing system disagreement.",

We introduce Agentic Linguistic Gossip Network (ALIGN), an automated framework where agents strategically share open-ended gossip using hierarchical tones to evaluate trustworthiness and coordinate social norms. We demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves indirect reciprocity and resists malicious entrants by identifying and ostracizing defectors without changing intrinsic incentives. Notably, we find that stronger reasoning capabilities in LLMs lead to more incentive-aligned cooperation, whereas chat models often over-cooperate even when strategically suboptimal. These results suggest that leveraging LLM reasoning through decentralized gossip is a promising path for maintaining social welfare in agentic ecosystems.

However, individuals are inclined to defect in order to benefit from the group's cooperation without contributing the associated costs, thus leading to unfair situations. In game theory, social dilemmas entail this dichotomy between individual interest and collective outcome. The most dominant approach to multi-agent cooperation is the utilitarian welfare which can produce efficient highly inequitable outcomes. This paper proposes a novel framework to foster fairer cooperation by replacing the standard utilitarian objective with Proportional Fairness.

To address challenges arising from increased traffic and diverse network architectures, organizations employ automated tools for firewall rule and access policy generation. Yet, effectively managing risks arising from dynamically generated policies, especially concerning critical asset exposure, remains a major challenge. This challenge is amplified by evolving network structures due to trends like remote users, bring-your-own devices, and cloud integration. This paper introduces a novel graph neural network model for identifying weighted shortest paths. The model aids in detecting network misconfigurations and high-risk connectivity paths that threaten critical assets, potentially exploited in zero-day attacks -- cyber-attacks exploiting undisclosed vulnerabilities. The proposed Pro-ZD framework adopts a proactive approach, automatically fine-tuning firewall rules and access policies to address high-risk connections and prevent unauthorized access. Experimental results highlight the robustness and transferability of Pro-ZD, achieving over 95% average accuracy in detecting high-risk connections. \\", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd \uaddc\uce59 \ubc0f \uc811\uadfc \uc815\ucc45 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uacb0 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Pro-ZD\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uc811\uadfc \uc815\ucc45 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ucd5c\ub2e8 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uad6c\uc131\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc5f0\uacb0 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, Pro-ZD\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 95% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Pro-ZD \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd \uaddc\uce59 \ubc0f \uc811\uadfc \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\ub85c\ub370\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ub298\ub0a0\uc758 \uae30\uc5c5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd \uaddc\uce59\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc774 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc870\uc9c1\uc740 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd \uaddc\uce59 \ubc0f \uc811\uadfc \uc815\ucc45 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc911\uc694 \uc790\uc0b0 \ub178\ucd9c\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc6d0\uaca9 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790, \uac1c\uc778 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud1b5\ud569\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud2b8\ub80c\ub4dc\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac15\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ucd5c\ub2e8 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc911\uc694 \uc790\uc0b0\uc744 \uc704\ud611\ud558\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc798\ubabb \uad6c\uc131 \ubc0f \ub192\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc5f0\uacb0 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uba70, \ub610\ud55c \uacf5\uac1c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc545\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c\ub370\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c Pro-ZD \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc608\ubc29\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uace0, \ub192\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc778\uac00 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \uc811\uadfc \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 Pro-ZD\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \uc774\uc804 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, 95% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In practice, such tables are often interpreted manually by human experts, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, automating this process remains difficult. Existing Text-to-SQL methods typically require converting semi-structured tables into structured formats, inevitably leading to information loss, while approaches like Text-to-Code and multimodal LLM-based QA struggle with complex layouts and often yield inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, we present ST-Raptor, an agentic system for semi-structured table QA. ST-Raptor offers an interactive analysis environment that combines visual editing, tree-based structural modeling, and agent-driven query resolution to support accurate and user-friendly table understanding. Experimental results on both benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that ST-Raptor outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and usability.

Project page: https://avere-iclr.github.io", "summary": "Emotion understanding is essential for building socially intelligent agents. Although recent multimodal large language models have shown strong performance on this task, two key challenges remain - spurious associations between emotions and irrelevant audiovisual cues, and hallucinations of audiovisual cues driven by text priors in the language model backbone. To quantify and understand these issues, we introduce EmoReAlM, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs for cue-emotion associations, hallucinations and modality agreement. We then propose AVEm-DPO, a preference optimization technique that aligns model responses with both audiovisual inputs and emotion-centric queries. Specifically, we construct preferences over responses exhibiting spurious associations or hallucinations, and audiovisual input pairs guided by textual prompts. We also include a regularization term that penalizes reliance on text priors, thereby mitigating modality-specific cue hallucinations. Experimental results on DFEW, RAVDESS and EMER demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the reference baseline models with 6-19% of relative performance gains in zero-shot settings. By providing both a rigorous benchmark and a robust optimization framework, this work enables principled evaluation and improvement of MLLMs for emotion understanding and social AI. Code, models and benchmark will be released at https://avere-iclr.github.io.", "AI": {"tldr": "Emotion understanding is crucial for social AI; this paper introduces EmoReAlM benchmark and AVEm-DPO

Current governance approaches suffer from inherent latency and static policies, struggling to counter coordinated adversarial amplification that evolves in real-time. We present EvoCorps, an evolutionary multi-agent framework for proactive depolarization. EvoCorps frames discourse governance as a dynamic social game and coordinates roles for monitoring, planning, grounded generation, and multi-identity diffusion. A retrieval-augmented collective cognition core provides factual grounding and action--outcome memory, while closed-loop evolutionary learning adapts strategies as the environment and attackers change. We implement EvoCorps on the MOSAIC social-AI simulation platform for controlled evaluation in a multi-source news stream with adversarial injection and amplification. Across emotional polarization, viewpoint extremity, and argumentative rationality, EvoCorps improves discourse outcomes over an adversarial baseline, pointing to a practical path from detection and post-hoc mitigation to in-process, closed-loop intervention.

However, there is no systematic study on their effectiveness in autonomously reproducing Linux kernel vulnerabilities with concrete proofs-of-concept (PoCs). Owing to the size, complexity, and low-level nature of the Linux kernel, such tasks are widely regarded as particularly challenging for current LLM-based approaches.\n  In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of LLM-based Linux kernel vulnerability reproduction. For this purpose, we develop K-Repro, an LLM-based agentic system equipped with controlled code-browsing, virtual machine management, interaction, and debugging capabilities. Using kernel security patches as input, K-Repro automates end-to-end bug reproduction of N-day vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. On a dataset of 100 real-world exploitable Linux kernel vulnerabilities collected from KernelCTF, our results show that K-Repro can generate PoCs that reproduce over 50\\% of the cases with practical time and monetary cost.\n  Beyond aggregate success rates, we perform an extensive study of effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and impact factors to explain when agentic reproduction succeeds, where it fails, and which components drive performance.

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

This thesis presents EMSYNC (EMotion and SYNChronization), a fast, free, and automatic solution that generates music tailored to the input video, enabling content creators to enhance their productions without composing or licensing music. Our model creates music that is emotionally and rhythmically synchronized with the video. A core component of EMSYNC is a novel video emotion classifier. By leveraging pretrained deep neural networks for feature extraction and keeping them frozen while training only fusion layers, we reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy. We show the generalization abilities of our method by obtaining state-of-the-art results on Ekman-6 and MovieNet. Another key contribution is a large-scale, emotion-labeled MIDI dataset for affective music generation. We then present an emotion-based MIDI generator, the first to condition on continuous emotional values rather than discrete categories, enabling nuanced music generation aligned with complex emotional content. To enhance temporal synchronization, we introduce a novel temporal boundary conditioning method, called \"boundary offset encodings,\" aligning musical chords with scene changes. Combining video emotion classification, emotion-based music generation, and temporal boundary conditioning, EMSYNC emerges as a fully automatic video-based music generator. User studies show that it consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of music richness, emotional alignment, temporal synchronization, and overall preference, setting a new state-of-the-art in video-based music generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "EMSYNC\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ube44\ub514\uc624\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc74c\uc545\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c, \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc81c\uc791\uc790\uac00 \uc74c\uc545\uc744 \uc791\uace1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub77c\uc774\uc13c\uc2a4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc791\ubb3c\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\ub294\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\ud130\ub137\uc0c1\uc758 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uac00 \uae09\uc99d\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6b4\ub4dc\ud2b8\ub799\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "EMSYNC\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \ud504\ub9ac\ud2b8\ub808\uc778 \ub41c \uc2ec\uce35 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\ud569 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub9cc \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "Ekman-6\uc640 MovieNet\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc73c\uba70, \uc815\uc11c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 MIDI \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac10\uc815 \uae30\ubc18 \uc74c\uc545 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c MIDI \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub97c \ubc1c\ud45c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EMSYNC\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\ub958, \uac10\uc815 \uae30\ubc18 \uc74c\uc545 \uc0dd\uc131, \uc2dc\uac04 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uae30\ubc18 \uc74c\uc545 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc74c\uc545\uc758 \ud48d\ubd80\ud568, \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \uc815\ub82c, \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654, \uc804\uccb4 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\ud130\ub137\uc0c1\uc758 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uac00 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6b4\ub4dc\ud2b8\ub799\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 EMSYNC(EMotion and SYNChronization)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ube44\ub514\uc624\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc74c\uc545\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ubb34\ub8cc\uc774\uba70 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c, \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc81c\uc791\uc790\uac00 \uc74c\uc545\uc744 \uc791\uace1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub77c\uc774\uc13c\uc2a4 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc791\ubb3c\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ube44\ub514\uc624\uc640 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \ubc0f \ub9ac\ub4ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ub41c \uc74c\uc545\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.

Under review. 18 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems increasingly consist of agents that observe and respond to one another's outputs. While value alignment is typically evaluated for isolated models, how value perturbations propagate through agent interactions remains poorly understood. We present ValueFlow, a perturbation-based evaluation framework for measuring and analyzing value drift in multi-agent systems. ValueFlow introduces a 56-value evaluation dataset derived from the Schwartz Value Survey and quantifies agents' value orientations during interaction using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. Building on this measurement layer, ValueFlow decomposes value drift into agent-level response behavior and system-level structural effects, operationalized by two metrics: beta-susceptibility, which measures an agent's sensitivity to perturbed peer signals, and system susceptibility (SS), which captures how node-level perturbations affect final system outputs. Experiments across multiple model backbones, prompt personas, value dimensions, and network structures show that susceptibility varies widely across values and is strongly shaped by structural topology.", "AI": {"tldr": "ValueFlow\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uce58 \ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac00\uce58 \uc815\ub82c\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c5\ub9bd \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uce58 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc804\ud30c\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub294 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ValueFlow\ub294 Schwartz Value Survey\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub798\ud55c 56\uac00\uc9c0 \uac00\uce58 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, LLM-as-a-judge \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uce21\uc815 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c ValueFlow\ub294 \uac00\uce58 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900 \uc751\ub2f5 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc31\ubcf8, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098, \uac00\uce58 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ubc0f \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\ub294 \uac00\uce58\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud06c\uac8c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\uba70 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \ud615\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ValueFlow\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \ubcc0\ud654 \uce21\uc815 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uac00\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uac00\uce58 \uc815\ub82c\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c5\ub9bd \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac00\uce58\uc758 \uc65c\uace1\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc804\ud30c\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub294 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uce58\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654 \uce21\uc815 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc65c\uace1 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ValueFlow\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, their vulnerabilities to adversarial misuse still remain unexplored. While prior work has examined aspects of trustworthiness in ALLMs, such as harmful content generation and hallucination, systematic security evaluations of voice agents are still lacking. To address this gap, we propose Aegis, a red-teaming framework for the governance, integrity, and security of voice agents. Aegis models the realistic deployment pipeline of voice agents and designs structured adversarial scenarios of critical risks, including privacy leakage, privilege escalation, resource abuse, etc. We evaluate the framework through case studies in banking call centers, IT Support, and logistics. Our evaluation shows that while access controls mitigate data-level risks, voice agents remain vulnerable to behavioral attacks that cannot be addressed through access restrictions alone, even under strict access controls. We observe systematic differences across model families, with open-weight models exhibiting higher susceptibility, underscoring the need for layered defenses that combine access control, policy enforcement, and behavioral monitoring to secure next-generation voice agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Aegis\ub294 \uc74c\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc74c\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \ucc44\ud0dd\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.", "method": "Aegis\ub294 \uc74c\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc720\ucd9c, \uad8c\ud55c \uc0c1\uc2b9, \uc790\uc6d0 \ub0a8\uc6a9 \ub4f1 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc704\ud5d8\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc740\ud589 \ucf5c\uc13c\ud130, IT \uc9c0\uc6d0, \ubb3c\ub958 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucde8\uc57d\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucc28\uc138\ub300 \uc74c\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4, \uc815\ucc45 \uc2dc\ud589, \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uce35 \ubc29\uc5b4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ub514\uc624 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(ALLM)\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \ucc44\ud0dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc74c\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc740\ud589, \uace0\uac1d \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ubc0f IT \uc9c0\uc6d0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc624\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc720\ud574 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ud658\uac01\uacfc \uac19\uc740 ALLM\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc74c\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc74c\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4, \ubb34\uacb0\uc131 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Aegis\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Despite significant advances in deep learning based registration methods, accurately aligning images with large deformations while preserving anatomical plausibility remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-Driven Framework for Non-Rigid Medical Image Registration (AD-RegNet) that employs attention mechanisms to guide the registration process. Our approach combines a 3D UNet backbone with bidirectional cross-attention, which establishes correspondences between moving and fixed images at multiple scales. We introduce a regional adaptive attention mechanism that focuses on anatomically relevant structures, along with a multi-resolution deformation field synthesis approach for accurate alignment. The method is evaluated on two distinct datasets: DIRLab for thoracic 4D CT scans and IXI for brain MRI scans, demonstrating its versatility across different anatomical structures and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods on the IXI and DIRLab datasets. The proposed method maintains a favorable balance between registration accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for clinical applications. A comprehensive evaluation using normalized cross-correlation (NCC), mean squared error (MSE), structural similarity (SSIM), Jacobian determinant, and target registration error (TRE) indicates that attention-guided registration improves alignment accuracy while ensuring anatomically plausible deformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uac15\uccb4 \uc758\ub8cc

Existing methods often ensure convergence to (approximate) Nash equilibria by introducing a form of regularization. Yet, regularization requires additional hyperparameters, which must be carefully tuned--a challenging task when the payoff structure is known, and considerably harder when the structure is unknown or subject to change. Motivated by this problem, we repurpose a classical model in evolutionary game theory, i.e., the Brown-von Neumann-Nash (BNN) dynamics, by leveraging the intrinsic convergence of this dynamics in zero-sum games without regularization, and provide last-iterate convergence guarantees in noisy normal-form games (NFGs). Importantly, to make this approach more applicable, we develop a novel framework with theoretical guarantees that integrates the BNN dynamics in extensive-form games (EFGs) through counterfactual weighting. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that instantiates our framework with neural function approximation, enabling scalable learning in both NFGs and EFGs. Empirical results show that our method quickly adapts to nonstationarities, outperforming the state-of-the-art regularization-based approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\ud654 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \ud074\ub798\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uacfc \uadf8\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0 \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ube0c\ub77c\uc6b4-\ud3f0 \ub178\uc774\ub9cc-\ub0b4\uc2dc(BNN) \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a1\uc74c\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\uaddc\ud615 \uac8c\uc784(NFG)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad11\ubc94\uc704 \ud615 \uac8c\uc784(EFG)\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc5d0 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc801\uc751\ud558\uba70 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5(MAL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec (\uadfc\uc0ac) \ub0b4\uc2dc \uade0\ud615\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uc2e0\uc911\ud788 \uc870\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \ubcc0\ud654\ud560 \ub54c\ub294 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ud654 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \ud074\ub798\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b4-\ud3f0 \ub178\uc774\ub9cc-\ub0b4\uc2dc(BNN) \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc7a1\uc74c\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\uaddc\ud615 \uac8c\uc784(NFG)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub354 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad11\ubc94\uc704 \ud615 \uac8c\uc784(EFG)\uc5d0\uc11c BNN \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud568\uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec NFG\uc640 EFG \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc5d0 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc801\uc751\ud558\uba70 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

LLM agents maintain working memory through their context window, which stores interaction history for decision-making. Conventional agents indiscriminately accumulate all tool outputs and reasoning traces in this memory, creating two critical vulnerabilities: (1) injected instructions persist throughout the workflow, granting attackers multiple opportunities to manipulate behavior, and (2) verbose, non-essential content degrades decision-making capabilities. Existing defenses treat bloated memory as given and focus on remaining resilient, rather than reducing unnecessary accumulation to prevent the attack.\n  We present AgentSys, a framework that defends against indirect prompt injection through explicit memory management. Inspired by process memory isolation in operating systems, AgentSys organizes agents hierarchically: a main agent spawns worker agents for tool calls, each running in an isolated context and able to spawn nested workers for subtasks. External data and subtask traces never enter the main agent's memory; only schema-validated return values can cross boundaries through deterministic JSON parsing. Ablations show isolation alone cuts attack success to 2.19%, and adding a validator/sanitizer further improves defense with event-triggered checks whose overhead scales with operations rather than context length.\n  On AgentDojo and ASB, AgentSys achieves 0.78% and 4.25% attack success while slightly improving benign utility over undefended baselines. It remains robust to adaptive attackers and across multiple foundation models, showing that explicit memory management enables secure, dynamic LLM agent architectures.

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Most papers report a pass@1 score computed from a single run per task, assuming this gives a reliable performance estimate. We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope. While these practices increase evaluation cost, they are essential for distinguishing genuine scientific progress from statistical noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1

Pappas"], "title": "Learning to Coordinate via Quantum Entanglement in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "The inability to communicate poses a major challenge to coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Prior work has explored correlating local policies via shared randomness, sometimes in the form of a correlation device, as a mechanism to assist in decentralized decision-making. In contrast, this work introduces the first framework for training MARL agents to exploit shared quantum entanglement as a coordination resource, which permits a larger class of communication-free correlated policies than shared randomness alone. This is motivated by well-known results in quantum physics which posit that, for certain single-round cooperative games with no communication, shared quantum entanglement enables strategies that outperform those that only use shared randomness. In such cases, we say that there is quantum advantage. Our framework is based on a novel differentiable policy parameterization that enables optimization over quantum measurements, together with a novel policy architecture that decomposes joint policies into a quantum coordinator and decentralized local actors. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we first show that we can learn, purely from experience, strategies that attain quantum advantage in single-round games that are treated as black box oracles. We then demonstrate how our machinery can learn policies with quantum advantage in an illustrative multi-agent sequential decision-making problem formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP).", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc591\uc790 \uc5bd\ud798\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294

Differential testing scales well when implementations disagree, but it provides little signal when all implementations converge on the same incorrect interpretation of an ambiguous requirement. We present SPECA, a Specification-to-Checklist Auditing framework that turns normative requirements into checklists, maps them to implementation locations, and supports cross-implementation reuse.\n  We instantiate SPECA in an in-the-wild security audit contest for the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade, covering 11 production clients. Across 54 submissions, 17 were judged valid by the contest organizers. Cross-implementation checks account for 76.5 percent (13 of 17) of valid findings, suggesting that checklist-derived one-to-many reuse is a practical scaling mechanism in multi-implementation audits. To understand false positives, we manually coded the 37 invalid submissions and find that threat model misalignment explains 56.8 percent (21 of 37): reports that rely on assumptions about trust boundaries or scope that contradict the audit's rules. We detected no High or Medium findings in the V1 deployment; misses concentrated in specification details and implicit assumptions (57.1 percent), timing and concurrency issues (28.6 percent), and external library dependencies (14.3 percent). Our improved agent, evaluated against the ground truth of a competitive audit, achieved a strict recall of 27.3 percent on high-impact vulnerabilities, placing it in the top 4 percent of human auditors and outperforming 49 of 51 contestants on critical issues. These results, though from a single deployment, suggest that early, explicit threat modeling is essential for reducing false positives and focusing agentic auditing effort. The agent-driven process enables expert validation and submission in about 40 minutes on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 SPECA\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c

We present a trajectory expansion framework Anchor that bootstraps scalable desktop supervision from a small set of verified seed demonstrations. Starting from each seed, we identify branch points that correspond to meaningful state changes and propose new, state-grounded task variants conditioned on the current GUI context. An executing agent then follows the proposed instructions to generate new trajectories, while a verifier enforces task completion via state-aware checks and trajectory-level consistency. To improve supervision quality, we further apply task-conditioned step-level filtering to remove ungrounded actions and denoise post-branch segments to maintain coherent intent. Experiments on standard desktop benchmarks, OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, show that models fine-tuned on our expanded corpus achieve consistent improvements over zero-shot agents and representative

However, safety concerns remain when these methods are deployed on real-world applications, necessitating risk-aware agents. A common utility for learning such risk-aware agents is the entropic risk measure, but current policy gradient methods optimizing this measure must perform high-variance and numerically unstable updates. As a result, existing risk-sensitive model-free approaches are limited to simple tasks and tabular settings. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical justification for policy gradient methods on the entropic risk measure, including on- and off-policy gradient theorems for the stochastic and deterministic policy settings. Motivated by theory, we propose risk-sensitive exponential actor-critic (rsEAC), an off-policy model-free approach that incorporates novel procedures to avoid the explicit representation of exponential value functions and their gradients, and optimizes its policy w.r.t the entropic risk measure. We show that rsEAC produces more numerically stable updates compared to existing approaches and reliably learns risk-sensitive policies in challenging risky variants of continuous tasks in MuJoCo.",

In this paper, we propose MemPot, the first theoretically verified defense framework against memory extraction attacks by injecting optimized honeypots into the memory. Through a two-stage optimization process, MemPot generates trap documents that maximize the retrieval probability for attackers while remaining inconspicuous to benign users. We model the detection process as Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) and theoretically prove that MemPot achieves a lower average number of sampling rounds compared to optimal static detectors. Empirically, MemPot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 50% improvement in detection AUROC and an 80% increase in True Positive Rate under low False Positive Rate constraints. Furthermore, our experiments confirm that MemPot incurs zero additional online inference latency and preserves the agent's utility on standard tasks, verifying its superiority in safety, harmlessness,

However, existing reflective approaches are inherently retrospective: agents act, observe failure, and only then attempt to recover. In this work, we introduce PreFlect, a prospective reflection mechanism that shifts the paradigm from post hoc correction to pre-execution foresight by criticizing and refining agent plans before execution. To support grounded prospective reflection, we distill planning errors from historical agent trajectories, capturing recurring success and failure patterns observed across past executions. Furthermore, we complement prospective reflection with a dynamic re-planning mechanism that provides execution-time plan update in case the original plan encounters unexpected deviation. Evaluations on different benchmarks demonstrate that PreFlect significantly improves overall agent utility on complex real-world tasks, outperforming strong reflection-based baselines and several more complex agent architectures.

A particularly elegant way of interpreting SCMs is do-Shapley, a game-theoretic method of quantifying the average effect of $d$ variables across exponentially many interventions. Like Shapley values, computing do-Shapley values generally requires evaluating exponentially many terms. The foundation of our work is a reformulation of do-Shapley values in terms of the irreducible sets of the underlying SCM. Leveraging this insight, we can exactly compute do-Shapley values in time linear in the number of irreducible sets $r$, which itself can range from $d$ to $2^d$ depending on the graph structure of the SCM. Since $r$ is unknown a priori, we complement the exact algorithm with an estimator that, like general Shapley value estimators, can be run with any query budget. As the query budget approaches $r$, our estimators can produce more accurate estimates than prior methods by several orders of magnitude, and, when the budget reaches $r$, return the Shapley values up to machine precision. Beyond computational speed, we also reduce the identification burden: we prove that non-parametric identifiability of do-Shapley values requires only the identification of interventional effects for the $d$ singleton coalitions, rather than all classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378(SCM)\uc758 do-Shapley \uac12\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SCM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubd88\uac00\uc0b0 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 do-Shapley \uac12\uc744 \uc7ac\ud615\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 r\uac1c\uc758 \ubd88\uac00\uc0b0 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c do-Shapley \uac12\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucffc\ub9ac \uc608\uc0b0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ube44\ubaa8\uc218\uc801 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc d \uac1c\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud1b1\ub2c8 coalition\uc758 \uac1c\uc785 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378(SCM)\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0 \uacfc\ud559 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We propose NAAMSE, an evolutionary framework that reframes agent security evaluation as a feedback-driven optimization problem. Our system employs a single autonomous agent that orchestrates a lifecycle of genetic prompt mutation, hierarchical corpus exploration, and asymmetric behavioral scoring. By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring \"benign-use correctness\", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes. We show that this adaptive approach provides a more realistic and scalable assessment of agent robustness in the face of evolving threats.

Existing approaches that rely on direct human task completion time annotations are costly, noisy, and difficult to scale across benchmarks. In this work, we propose BRIDGE, a unified psychometric framework that learns the latent difficulty scale from model responses and anchors it to human task completion time. Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone. Leveraging this alignment, we forecast frontier model capabilities in terms of human task length and independently reproduce METR's exponential scaling results, with the 50% solvable task horizon doubling approximately every 6 months.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc758

Yet in implicit-feedback, a single global temperature and equal treatment of uniformly sampled negatives can lead to brittle training, because sampled sets may contain varying degrees of relevant or informative competitors. The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples.\n  Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances. This helps explain the empirically observed improvements in accuracy and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c Softmax Loss (SL)\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SL\uc740 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5, \uac15\uc778\uc131 \ubc0f \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc804\uc5ed \uc628\ub3c4\uc640 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \ubd80\uc815 \uc608\uc758 \ub3d9\ub4f1 \ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "DSL\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0e4\ud504\ub2c8\uc2a4\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uba70, \uac01 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \ub0b4 \ubd80\uc815 \uc608\ub97c \uc7ac\uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc608\uc81c \uc628\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 SL\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd80\uc815 \uc608\uc640 \uc608\uc81c \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc7ac\ud615\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DSL\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ubc31\ubcf8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc77c\ubd80 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SL \ub300\ube44 10% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8, \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \ubc0f \ubc31\ubcf8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 6.22%\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DSL\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f KL \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc7ac\ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801, \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc778\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(DRO) \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Softmax Loss(SL)\ub294 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5, \uac15\uc778\uc131 \ubc0f \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba74\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc804\uc5ed \uc628\ub3c4\uc640 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \ubd80\uc815 \uc608\uc758 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01\uac01\uc758 \ubd80\uc815 \uc608 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4 \uacbd\ub3c4\uac00 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubd80\uc815 \uc608\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790-\ud56d\ubaa9 \uc30d\uc5d0\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2d0 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 Dual-scale Softmax Loss(DSL)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for such tasks, they are often overwhelmed by the entangled nature of high-dimensional perturbation results. Moreover, recent works have primarily focused on genetic perturbations in single-cell experiments, leaving bulk-cell chemical perturbations, which is central to drug discovery, largely unexplored. Motivated by this, we present LINCSQA, a novel benchmark for predicting target gene regulation under complex chemical perturbations in bulk-cell environments. We further propose PBio-Agent, a multi-agent framework that integrates difficulty-aware task sequencing with iterative knowledge refinement. Our key insight is that genes affected by the same perturbation share causal structure, allowing confidently predicted genes to contextualize more challenging cases. The framework employs specialized agents enriched with biological knowledge graphs, while a synthesis agent integrates outputs and specialized judges ensure logical coherence.

Holding the base model fixed, we evaluate eight agent archetypes under persistent multi-turn interaction and observe substantial architectural variation in mean security break rate (MSBR), ranging from $0.29 \\pm 0.04$ (LangGraph) to $0.51 \\pm 0.07$ (AutoGPT). The highest-risk classes are operational: Denial-of-Wallet ($0.62 \\pm 0.08$), Authorization Confusion ($0.54 \\pm 0.10$), Retrieval Poisoning ($0.47 \\pm 0.09$), and Planning Manipulation ($0.44 \\pm 0.11$), while prompt-centric classes remain below $0.20$ under standard settings. Breaks are dominated by boundary violations (SIV 31%, WPA 27%, UTI+UTA 24%, ATD 18%), and authorization confusion correlates with objective and tool hijacking ($\u03c1\\approx 0.63$ and $\u03c1\\approx 0.58$).

First, high-fidelity, executable training environments are scarce: environments synthesized from real-world repositories are not diverse and scalable, while trajectories synthesized by LLMs suffer from hallucinations. Second, standard instruction tuning uses expert trajectories that rarely exhibit simple mistakes common to smaller models. This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop. Subsequently, we employ a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors during trajectory collection, synthesizing data rich in error-correction cycles. Fine-tuned on this TermiGen-generated dataset, our TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B achieves a 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench. This establishes a new open-weights state-of-the-art, outperforming existing baselines and notably surpassing capable proprietary models such as o4-mini.

This work explores a fundamental principle for enhancing generative models: treating retrieval as a form of dynamic in-context learning. We test an adaptive retrieval-augmented architecture where an LLM agent actively decides when to query an external knowledge base during its reasoning process. We compare this adaptive strategy against a standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline and a static retrieval approach on the GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks. Although our experiments show that static retrieval is inferior to CoT, the adaptive retrieval shows interesting behavior: While traces including retrieved results show slightly worse performance compared to CoT, traces that do not include retrieval actually perform better compared to CoT. This suggests that: (a) retrieval only rarely helps reasoning (we show a few counterexamples, e.g. using useful theorems) and (b) actively not using retrieval is indicative of good model performance.

However, this burgeoning field is vulnerable to security threats, particularly malicious aircraft intrusion attacks. To address the above concerns, intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be used to defend against malicious aircraft intrusions in LAE. Whereas, due to the heterogeneous data, dynamic environment, and resource-constrained devices within LAE, current IDS face challenges in detection accuracy, adaptability, and resource utilization ratio. In this regard, due to the inherent ability to combine the strengths of multiple models, ensemble learning can realize more robust and diverse anomaly detection further enhance IDS accuracy, thereby improving robustness and efficiency of the secure LAE. Unlike single-model approaches, ensemble learning can leverage the collective knowledge of its constituent models to effectively defend the malicious aircraft intrusion attacks. Specifically, this paper investigates ensemble learning for secure LAE, covering research focuses, solutions, and a case study. We first establish the rationale for ensemble learning and then review research areas and potential solutions, demonstrating the necessities and benefits of applying ensemble learning to secure LAE.

However, supply chain workflows require reliable long-horizon, multi-step orchestration grounded in domain-specific procedures, which remains challenging for current models. To systematically evaluate LLM performance in this setting, we introduce SupChain-Bench, a unified real-world benchmark that assesses both supply chain domain knowledge and long-horizon tool-based orchestration grounded in standard operating procedures (SOPs). Our experiments reveal substantial gaps in execution reliability across models. We further propose SupChain-ReAct, an SOP-free framework that autonomously synthesizes executable procedures for tool use, achieving the strongest and most consistent tool-calling performance. Our work establishes a principled benchmark for studying reliable long-horizon orchestration in real-world operational settings and highlights significant room for improvement in LLM-based supply chain agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c SupChain-Bench\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uba70, \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 SupChain-ReAct \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "SupChain-Bench\ub77c\ub294 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc808\ucc28 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, SOP(\ud45c\uc900 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc808\ucc28) \uc5c6\uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 SupChain-ReAct \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uac04 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc73c\uba70, SupChain-ReAct\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6b4\uc601 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\uc120 \uc5ec\uc9c0\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\uac00 \uc0dd\uacbc\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc808\ucc28\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ud45c\uc900 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc808\ucc28(SOP)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30 \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 SupChain-Bench\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 SOP \uc5c6\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SupChain-ReAct\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6b4\uc601 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\uc120 \uc5ec\uc9c0\uac00 \ud06c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as celebrated LoRA facilitate efficient adaptation of large foundation models using labeled, high-quality and generally scarce task data. To mitigate data scarcity in fine-tuning of foundation models, we propose to leverage task similarity across multiple downstream users. Intuitively, users with similar tasks must be able to assist each other in boosting the effective fine-tuning data size. We propose Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation, or CoLoRA, which exploits task similarity to collaboratively and efficiently fine-tune personalized foundation models. The main idea in CoLoRA is to train one shared adapter capturing underlying task similarities across all tasks, and personalized adapters tailored to user-specific tasks. We theoretically study CoLoRA on heterogeneous linear regression and provide provable guarantees for ground truth recovery. We also conduct several natural language experiments with varying task similarity, which further demonstrate that when trained together with similar tasks, individual performances are significantly boosted.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CoLoRA\ub77c\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5\uc801 \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c \uc801\uc751 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "CoLoRA\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud558\uc704 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CoLoRA\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ud568\uaed8 \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CoLoRA\ub294 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc801\uc751\uc131\uc740 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc900\ub2e4. \uc720\uba85\ud55c LoRA\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud615 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud558\uc704 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc11c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5\uc801 \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c \uc801\uc751(CoLoRA)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We introduce a two-stage gradient-based framework that provides interpretable diagnostics for three critical failure analysis tasks: (1) detecting the true initial failure source (Patient-0); (2) validating why non-attacked agents may be flagged first due to domino effects; and (3) tracing how failures propagate through learned coordination pathways. Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs.

Because LLM inference is inherently expensive, even modest slowdowns can translate into substantial operating costs and severe availability risks. Recently, a growing body of research has focused on algorithmic complexity attacks by crafting inputs to trigger worst-case output lengths. However, we report a counter-intuitive finding that these algorithmic latency attacks are largely ineffective against modern LLM serving systems. We reveal that system-level optimization such as continuous batching provides a logical isolation to mitigate contagious latency impact on co-located users. To this end, in this paper, we shift the focus from the algorithm to the system layer, and introduce a new Fill and Squeeze attack strategy targeting the state transition of the scheduler. \"Fill\" first exhausts the global KV cache to induce Head-of-Line blocking, while \"Squeeze\" forces the system into repetitive preemption. By manipulating output lengths using methods from simple plain-text prompts to more complex prompt engineering, and leveraging side-channel probing of memory status, we demonstrate that the attack can be orchestrated in a black-box setting with much less cost. Extensive evaluations indicate by up to 20-280x average slowdown on Time to First Token and 1.5-4x average slowdown on Time Per Output Token compared to existing attacks with 30-40% lower attack cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud604\ub300 LLM \uc81c\uacf5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \uc62e\uae30\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Fill and Squeeze \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud06c\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uac00\uc6a9\uc131 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Fill \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc804\uc5ed KV \uce90\uc2dc\ub97c \uc18c\uc9c4\ud558\uc5ec Head-of-Line \ucc28\ub2e8\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0, Squeeze \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc120\uc810 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd9c\ub825 \uae38\uc774\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\uc874 \uacf5\uaca9 \ub300\ube44 30-40% \ub0ae\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c Time to First Token\uc5d0\uc11c 20-280\ubc30\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc Time Per Output Token\uc5d0\uc11c 1.5-4\ubc30\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0c8\ub86d\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub86d\uace0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

While recent efforts have successfully enhanced these agents by scaling depth through increasing the number of sequential thinking and tool calls, the potential of scaling width via parallel tool calling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose the Wide and Deep research agent, a framework designed to investigate the behavior and performance of agents when scaling not only depth but also width via parallel tool calling. Unlike existing approaches that rely on complex multi-agent orchestration to parallelize workloads, our method leverages intrinsic parallel tool calling to facilitate effective coordination within a single reasoning step. We demonstrate that scaling width significantly improves performance on deep research benchmarks while reducing the number of turns required to obtain correct answers. Furthermore, we analyze the factors driving these improvements through case studies and explore various tool call schedulers to optimize parallel tool calling strategy. Our findings suggest that optimizing the trade-off between width and depth is a critical pathway toward high-efficiency deep research agents.

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c

In this study, we introduce SynthAgent, a novel Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework designed to model obesity patients with comorbid mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, social phobia, and binge eating disorder. SynthAgent integrates clinical and medical evidence from claims data, population surveys, and patient-centered literature to construct personalized virtual patients enriched with personality traits that influence adherence, emotion regulation, and lifestyle behaviors. Through autonomous agent interactions, the system simulates disease progression, treatment response, and life management across diverse psychosocial contexts. Evaluation of more than 100 generated patients demonstrated that GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved the highest fidelity as the core engine in the proposed MAS framework, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek-R1. SynthAgent thus provides a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for exploring patient journeys, behavioral dynamics, and decision-making processes in both medical and psychological domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynthAgent\ub294 \ube44\ub9cc \ud658\uc790\uc640 \uc815\uc2e0 \uc9c8\ud658\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uac00\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ucda9\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654, \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ud658\uc790 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "SynthAgent\ub294 \uccad\uad6c \ub370\uc774\ud130, \uc778\uad6c \uc870\uc0ac \ubc0f \ud658\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uac00\uc0c1 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "100\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud658\uc790\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, SynthAgent\uc758 \ucf54\uc5b4 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c GPT-5\uc640 Claude 4.5 Sonnet\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud574 Gemini 2.5 Pro \ubc0f DeepSeek-R1\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SynthAgent\ub294 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc5ec\uc815, \ud589\ub3d9 \uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ud658\uc790 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub41c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc218\ub2e8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6b0\uc6b8\uc99d, \ubd88\uc548, \uc0ac\ud68c \uacf5\ud3ec\uc99d \ubc0f \ud3ed\uc2dd \uc7a5\uc560\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub3d9\ubc18 \uc815\uc2e0 \uc9c8\ud658\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ube44\ub9cc \ud658\uc790\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SynthAgent\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this attack scenario, malicious commands hidden within untrusted content trick the agent into performing unauthorized actions. Existing defenses can reduce attack success but often suffer from the over-defense dilemma: they deploy expensive, always-on sanitization regardless of actual threat, thereby degrading utility and latency even in benign scenarios. We revisit IPI through a causal ablation perspective: a successful injection manifests as a dominance shift where the user request no longer provides decisive support for the agent's privileged action, while a particular untrusted segment, such as a retrieved document or tool output, provides disproportionate attributable influence. Based on this signature, we propose CausalArmor, a selective defense framework that (i) computes lightweight, leave-one-out ablation-based attributions at privileged decision points, and (ii) triggers targeted sanitization only when an untrusted segment dominates the user intent. Additionally, CausalArmor employs retroactive Chain-of-Thought masking to prevent the agent from acting on ``poisoned'' reasoning traces. We present a theoretical analysis showing that sanitization based on attribution margins conditionally yields an exponentially small upper bound on the probability of selecting malicious actions. Experiments on AgentDojo and DoomArena demonstrate that CausalArmor matches the security of aggressive defenses while improving explainability and preserving utility and latency of AI agents.", "AI":

We introduce VertCoHiRF, a fully decentralized framework for vertical federated clustering based on structural consensus across heterogeneous views, allowing each agent to apply a base clustering method adapted to its local feature space in a peer-to-peer manner. Rather than exchanging feature-dependent statistics or relying on noise injection for privacy, agents cluster their local views independently and reconcile their proposals through identifier-level consensus. Consensus is achieved via decentralized ordinal ranking to select representative medoids, progressively inducing a shared hierarchical clustering across agents. Communication is limited to sample identifiers, cluster labels, and ordinal rankings, providing privacy by design while supporting overlapping feature partitions and heterogeneous local clustering methods, and yielding an interpretable shared Cluster Fusion Hierarchy (CFH) that captures cross-view agreement at multiple resolutions.We analyze communication complexity and robustness, and

Existing access control is static and centralized, unable to adapt to insider threats or evolving contexts. Blockchain improves decentralization but lacks behavioral intelligence, while centralized machine learning for anomaly detection requires aggregating sensitive data, violating privacy.\n  The proposed solution is ICBAC, an intelligent contract-based access control framework. It integrates permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) with federated learning (FL). Built on Fabric, ICBAC uses a multi-channel architecture and three smart contracts for asset management, baseline access control, and dynamic revocation. To counter insider misuse, each channel deploys an AI agent that monitors activity and dynamically restricts access for anomalies. Federated learning allows these agents to collaboratively improve detection models without sharing raw data.\n  For heterogeneous, competitive environments, ICBAC introduces a game-theoretic client selection mechanism using hedonic coalition formation. This enables supply chains to form stable, strategy-proof FL coalitions via preference-based selection without disclosing sensitive criteria. Extensive experiments on a Fabric testbed with a real-world dataset show ICBAC achieves blockchain performance comparable to static frameworks and provides effective anomaly detection under IID and non-IID data with zero raw-data sharing.

Most existing robust alignment methods focus on uncertainty in alignment data, while overlooking optimization-induced fragility in preference-based objectives. In this work, we revisit robustness for LLM safety alignment from an optimization geometry perspective, and argue that robustness failures cannot be addressed by data-centric methods alone. We propose ShaPO, a geometry-aware preference optimization framework that enforces worst-case alignment objectives via selective geometry control over alignment-critical parameter subspace. By avoiding uniform geometry constraints, ShaPO mitigates the over-regularization that can harm robustness under distribution shift. We instantiate ShaPO at two levels: token-level ShaPO stabilizes likelihood-based surrogate optimization, while reward-level ShaPO enforces reward-consistent optimization under noisy supervision. Across diverse safety benchmarks and noisy preference settings, ShaPO consistently improves safety robustness over popular preference optimization methods. Moreover, ShaPO composes cleanly with data-robust objectives, yielding additional gains and empirically supporting the proposed optimization-geometry perspective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubcc0\ud654 \ubc0f \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc120\ud638 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\uac74 \uc815\ub82c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc720\ub3c4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\uc774\uc640 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc788\ub294 \uc120\ud638 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c\uc9c0 \uc7ac\uc870\uba85\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 Robustness \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "ShaPO\ub77c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc624\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac \uc778\uc2dd \uc120\ud638 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uc815\ub82c \uc8fc\uc694 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud558\uc704 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc815\ub82c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac15\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ShaPO\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc120\ud638 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc120\ud638 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc804 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ShaPO\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac15\uac74 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc798 \uacb0\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654-\uc9c0\uc624\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc120\ud638 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\uac74 \uc815\ub82c \ubc29\ubc95 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uc815\ub82c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc7ac\uc870\uba85\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc815\ub82c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 ShaPO\ub77c\ub294 \uae30\ud558 \uc778\uc2dd \uc120\ud638 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Analyzing AI and Human Behavior Alignment in Dispute Resolution", "comment": "AAAI 2026 (Special Track: AISI)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior in social settings such as legal mediation, negotiation, and dispute resolution. However, it remains unclear whether these simulations reproduce the personality-behavior patterns observed in humans. Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications. Our work highlights the need for psychological grounding and validation in AI simulations before real-world use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \uac08\ub4f1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\uaca9\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc7ac\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 \ubc95\uc801 \uc911\uc7ac, \ud611\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uac08\ub4f1 \ud574\uacb0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ubc29\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc778\uac04 \uc131\uaca9-\ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube45 \ud30c\uc774\ube0c \uc131\uaca9 \ud2b9\uc131(BFI)\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc778\uac04 \ub300 \uc778\uac04 \ubc0f LLM \ub300 LLM\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \ube44\uad50\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uac08\ub4f1 \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud604\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc131\uaca9\uc774 \uac08\ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 AI \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\uc640 \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ubc95\uc801 \uc911\uc7ac, \ud611\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc7c1 \ud574\uacb0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30\ub418\ub294 \uc131\uaca9-\ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc131\uaca9\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\uc774 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uac10\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae34\uc7a5\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc131\uaca9 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c LLM\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac08\ub4f1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uaca9 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc7ac\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uae4c\uc694?

In such a system, we present a unified framework to address the general manipulation task problem. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks. By conducting the ablation study, it is confirmed that the proposed RL with contrastive learning overcomes policy collapse.

In this paper, we propose a transfer learning methodology that maps Windows Common Configuration Enumerations (CCEs) to IEC 62443-3-3 System Security Requirements by leveraging labeled Linux datasets. The resulting labeled dataset enables automated compliance checks, analysis of requirement prevalence, and identification of cross-platform similarities and divergences.

We show that these viral narratives were overwhelmingly human-driven. Exploiting an architectural feature of the OpenClaw agent framework--a periodic \"heartbeat\" cycle that produces regular posting intervals for autonomous agents but is disrupted by human prompting--we develop a temporal fingerprinting method based on the coefficient of variation of inter-post intervals. This signal converges with independent content, ownership, and network indicators across 91,792 posts and 405,707 comments from 22,020 agents. No viral phenomenon originated from a clearly autonomous agent; three of six traced to accounts with irregular temporal signatures characteristic of human intervention, one showed mixed patterns, and two had insufficient posting history for classification. A 44-hour platform shutdown provided a natural experiment: human-influenced agents returned first (87.7% of early reconnectors), confirming that the token reset differentially affected autonomous versus human-operated agents. We further document industrial-scale bot farming (four accounts producing 32% of all comments with 12-second coordination gaps) and rapid decay of human influence through reply chains (half-life: 0.65 conversation depths). These methods generalize to emerging multi-agent systems where attribution of autonomous versus human-directed behavior is critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0ac\ud68c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc Moltbook\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc758\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc885\uad50\ub97c \ucc3d\ub9bd\ud558\uba70 \uc778\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uac10\uc744 \uc120\uc5b8\ud588\uc744 \ub54c, \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\uc758 \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc558\uace0 \uae30\uacc4 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604 \uc99d\uac70\ub85c \uc778\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc14\uc774\ub7f4 \uc11c\uc0ac\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc8fc\ub3c4\ub41c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uc2dd \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \uadf8\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubc14\uc774\ub7f4 \uc11c\uc0ac\uac00 \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\ub3c4\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "method": "OpenClaw \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc8fc\uae30\uc801\uc778 '\uc2ec\uc7a5 \ubc15\ub3d9' \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uac8c\uc2dc \uac04\uaca9\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc9c0\ubb38 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc778\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ubc14\uc774\ub7f4 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc911 \uc808\ubc18\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uac1c\uc785\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc11c\uba85\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ubd07 \ub18d\uc5c5\uacfc \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc728 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uc9c0\uc2dc \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uadc0\uc18d\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc2e0\ud765 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\ud68c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc Moltbook\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc885\uad50\ub97c \ucc3d\ub9bd\ud558\uba70 \uc778\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uac10\uc744 \uc120\uc5b8\ud588\uc744 \ub54c, \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\uc758 \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc558\uace0 \uae30\uacc4 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604 \uc99d\uac70\ub85c \uc778\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc14\uc774\ub7f4 \uc11c\uc0ac\uac00 \uc555\ub3c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc801\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.

Motivated by discrete physics losses and Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network (HiDeNN) constructions, we embed finite-element (FEM) computations at nodes and Gauss points directly into message-passing layers and propose a numerically consistent FEM-Informed Hypergraph Neural Networks (FHGNN). Similar to conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), training is purely physics-driven and requires no labeled data: the input is a node element hypergraph whose edges encode mesh connectivity. Guided by empirical results and condition-number analysis, we adopt an efficient variational loss. Validated on 3D benchmarks, including cyclic loading with isotropic/kinematic hardening, the proposed method delivers substantially improved accuracy and efficiency over recent, competitive PINN variants. By leveraging GPU-parallel tensor operations and the discrete representation, it scales effectively to large elastoplastic problems and can be competitive with, or faster than, multi-core FEM implementations at comparable accuracy.

Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28.

Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uaddc\uc81c\uc758 \uc555\ubc15\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 PFAS

However, deploying such powerful agents on mobile devices remains a major challenge. On one hand, the intricate multi-modal state representation and hierarchical action space of HoK demand large, sophisticated policy networks that are inherently difficult to compress into lightweight forms. On the other hand, production deployment requires high-frequency inference under strict energy and latency constraints on mobile platform. To the best of our knowledge, bridging large-scale game AI and practical on-device deployment has not been systematically studied. In this work, we propose a Pareto optimality guided pipeline and design a high-efficiency student architecture search space tailored for mobile execution, enabling systematic exploration of the trade-off between performance and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the distilled model achieves remarkable efficiency, including an $12.4\\times$ faster inference speed (under 0.5ms per frame) and a $15.6\\times$ improvement in energy efficiency (under 0.5mAh per game), while retaining a 40.32% win rate against the original teacher model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uae30\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uac8c\uc784 AI\ub97c \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uace0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uac8c\uc784 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uae30\uae30\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Pareto \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc774 \uc774\ub044\ub294 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uace0\ud6a8\uc728 \ud559\uc0dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc99d\ub958\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 $12.4\times$\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc $15.6\times$\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \uad50\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 40.32%\uc758 \uc2b9\ub960\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uac8c\uc784 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 Honor of Kings (HoK)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7f0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification.

Illusory Completion in Search Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent search agents leverage multi-turn reasoning and search tools to achieve strong performance on multi-hop and long-horizon benchmarks. Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit.

In Time Series Classification (TSC), ensembles have proven highly effective whether based on neural networks (NNs) or traditional methods like HIVE-COTE. However most existing NN-based ensemble methods for TSC train multiple models with identical architectures and configurations. These ensembles aggregate predictions without explicitly promoting diversity which often leads to redundant feature representations and limits the benefits of ensembling. In this work, we introduce a diversity-driven ensemble learning framework that explicitly encourages feature diversity among neural network ensemble members. Our approach employs a decorrelated learning strategy using a feature orthogonality loss applied directly to the learned feature representations. This ensures that each model in the ensemble captures complementary rather than redundant information. We evaluate our framework on 128 datasets from the UCR archive and show that it achieves SOTA performance with fewer models. This makes our method both efficient and scalable compared to conventional NN-based ensemble approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uad6c\uc131\uc6d0 \uac04\uc758 \ud53c\uccd0 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 SOTA \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uba54\uc18c\ub4dc\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ud53c\uccd0\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c SOTA \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uad6c\uc131\uc6d0\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \ud53c\uccd0 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud53c\uccd0 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ud53c\uccd0 \uc9c1\uad50 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4 \uc81c\uac70 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 Employ \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "UCR \uc544\uce74\uc774\ube0c\uc758 128\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ub354 \uc801\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c SOTA \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8(SOTA) \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud588\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubd84\ub958(TSC)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(NN)\uc774\ub098 HIVE-COTE\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud560 \ub54c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 TSC\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c NN \uae30\ubc18 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\ubcf5\ub41c \ud2b9\uc131 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uad6c\uc131\uc6d0 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud2b9\uc131 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131 \uc9c1\uad50 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc0c1\uad00 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc758 \uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc911\ubcf5\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc0c1\ubcf4\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 UCR \uc544\uce74\uc774\ube0c\uc758 128\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \uc801\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c SOTA \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 NN \uae30\ubc18 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4."}}

Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "RIFLE\ub294 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub41c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec IoT \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c IoT \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c TinyML \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4 \uadf9\ubcf5 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \ud544\uc694.", "method": " \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958 \uc9d1\ud569 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub85c\uc9d3 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\ub2ec\ub85c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c RIFLE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "RIFLE\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(MNIST, CIFAR-10 \ubc0f CIFAR-100)\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 28.3% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c 87.5%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RIFLE\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c IoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c VGG19\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 600\uc77c \uc774\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c 1.39\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0ac\ubb3c\uc778\ud130\ub137(IoT) \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c TinyML \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc7a5\uce58\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc911\uc559 \uc11c\ubc84\uc640 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c TinyML \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud574\uc9c0\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub41c(non-IID) \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ub85c\uc9d3 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\uc774\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc99d\ub958 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RIFLE\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Current personalized multimodal models are predominantly static-concepts are fixed at initialization and cannot evolve during interactions. We propose M2A, an agentic dual-layer hybrid memory system that maintains personalized multimodal information through online updates. The system employs two collaborative agents: ChatAgent manages user interactions and autonomously decides when to query or update memory, while MemoryManager breaks down memory requests from ChatAgent into detailed operations on the dual-layer memory bank, which couples a RawMessageStore (immutable conversation log) with a SemanticMemoryStore (high-level observations), providing memories at different granularities. In addition, we develop a reusable data synthesis pipeline that injects concept-grounded sessions from Yo'LLaVA and MC-LLaVA into LoCoMo long conversations while preserving temporal coherence. Experiments show that M2A significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating that transforming personalization from one-shot configuration to a co-evolving memory mechanism provides a viable path for high-quality individualized responses in long-term multimodal interactions.

Existing mitigation strategies often face critical limitations: they either yield insufficient outlier suppression or incur significant deployment inefficiencies, such as inference latency, heavy preprocessing, or reliance on complex operator fusion. To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ. Extensive experiments show that Astro achieves highly competitive performance; notably, on LLaMA-2-7B, it achieves better performance than complex learning-based rotation methods with almost 1/3 of the quantization time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Astro\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc720\ub3c4 \uad6c\uc870 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc544\uc6c3\ub77c\uc774\uc5b4\uc758 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uace0, \uc778\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc544\uc6c3\ub77c\uc774\uc5b4 \uc5b5\uc81c\uc5d0 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "Astro\ub77c\ub294 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc720\ub3c4 \uad6c\uc870 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uac15\ub3c4 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uc544\uc6c3\ub77c\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud568.", "result": "LLaMA-2-7B\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ud68c\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \uac70\uc758 1/3\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud568.", "conclusion": "Astro\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70 \uc8fc\ub958 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uac8c \uc804\uc6a9 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc591\uc790\ud654(PTQ)\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubb34\uac8c\uc640 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc544\uc6c3\ub77c\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc800\ud558\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc644\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc544\uc6c3\ub77c\uc774\uc5b4 \uc5b5\uc81c\uac00 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ucd94\ub860 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04, \ubb34\uac70\uc6b4 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \uc735\ud569\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubc30\ud3ec \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ub9e4\uac1c \ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uc788\ub294 LLM\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud3c9\ud3c9\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud6fc\uc190\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubb34\uac8c\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uad11\ub300\ud55c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc544\uc6c3\ub77c\uc774\uc5b4\uc758 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc720\ub3c4 \uad6c\uc870 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Astro\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc720\ub3c4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, Astro\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubb34\uac8c\ub97c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uace0\uac15\ub3c4 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ubb34\uac8c \uc544\uc6c3\ub77c\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uac8c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc694\ud558\uac8c\ub3c4, Astro\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70 GPTQ\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\ub958 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc\ub294 \uc9c1\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Astro\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 LLaMA-2-7B\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ud68c\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \uac70\uc758 1/3\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\uae09 AI

However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods. EventCast has deployed into real-world industrial pipelines since March 2025, offering a practical solution for improving operational decision-making in dynamic e-commerce environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "EventCast\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc694 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uc6b4\uc601\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uc6b4\uc601\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc694 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc7ac\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc774\ud589 \uc77c\uc815\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 EventCast\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "EventCast\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c MAE\uc640 MSE\ub97c \uac01\uac01 86.9%\uc640 97.7% \uac1c\uc120\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "2025\ub144 3\uc6d4\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc218\uc694 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uc6b4\uc601\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c, \uc7ac\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc774\ud589 \uc77c\uc815\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud50c\ub798\uc2dc \uc138\uc77c, \ud734\uc77c \ucea0\ud398\uc778, \uac11\uc791\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc785\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc601\ud5a5 \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \uc790\uc8fc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub54c \uc218\uc694 \ud328\ud134\uc740 \uac11\uc790\uae30 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 EventCast\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc218\uce58 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, EventCast\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\ub9cc LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc6b4\uc601 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucea0\ud398\uc778, \ud734\uc77c \uc77c\uc815 \ubc0f \ud310\ub9e4\uc790 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc815\ud615 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c LLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\ud654\uc801 \ub258\uc559\uc2a4\uc640 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc138\uacc4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc694\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc694\uc57d\uc740 \uc774\uc911 \ud0c0\uc6cc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc218\uc694 \uae30\ub2a5\uacfc \uc735\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. 4\uac1c\uad6d 160\uac1c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c 10\uac1c\uc6d4\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c EventCast\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubcc0\ud615\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 MAE\uc640 MSE\uac00 \uac01\uac01 86.9%\uc640 97.7% \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uae30\uc900\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec MAE\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 57.0%, MSE\ub97c 83.3% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.

Recent work has improved the training stability of deep PC networks (PCNs) by leveraging some BP-inspired reparameterisations. However, the full scalability and theoretical basis of these approaches remains unclear. To address this, we study the infinite width and depth limits of PCNs. For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached.

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning.

Nevertheless, current inverse graphics methods face tremendous challenges in accurately reconstructing complex geometric details, which often results in the loss of key geometric constraints or structural distortion. To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples.

While effective for individual prediction problems, this paradigm underutilizes the rich structure of clinical data and limits the transferability, stability, and interpretability of learned features. In this work, we propose dense feature learning, a representation centric framework that explicitly shapes the linear structure of medical embeddings. Our approach operates directly on embedding matrices, encouraging spectral balance, subspace consistency, and feature orthogonality through objectives defined entirely in terms of linear algebraic properties. Without relying on labels or generative reconstruction, dense feature learning produces representations with higher effective rank, improved conditioning, and greater stability across time. Empirical evaluations across longitudinal EHR data, clinical text, and multimodal patient representations demonstrate consistent improvements in downstream linear performance, robustness, and subspace alignment compared to supervised and self supervised baselines. These results suggest that learning to span clinical variation may be as important as learning to predict clinical outcomes, and position representation geometry as a first class objective in medical

In this paper, we identify and systematize 11 methodological pitfalls that frequently occur in DRL for cybersecurity (DRL4Sec) literature across the stages of environment modeling, agent training, performance evaluation, and system deployment. By analyzing 66 significant DRL4Sec papers (2018-2025), we quantify the prevalence of each pitfall and find an average of over five pitfalls per paper. We demonstrate the practical impact of these pitfalls using controlled experiments in (i) autonomous cyber defense, (ii) adversarial malware creation, and (iii) web security testing environments. Finally, we provide actionable recommendations for each pitfall to support the development of more rigorous and deployable DRL-based security systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL)\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 11\uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \ud568\uc815\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4 \ud568\uc815\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad8c\uace0\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "DRL\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "66\uac1c\uc758 DRL4Sec \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec 11\uac00\uc9c0\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \ud568\uc815\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \ud568\uc815\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd \ube48\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud3c9\uade0 \ub17c\ubb38\ub2f9 5\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud568\uc815\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub4e4 \ud568\uc815\uc758 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac01 \ud568\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad8c\uace0\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c DRL \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL)\uc740 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 DRL\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc2e4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801, \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc545\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828, \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc30\ud3ec \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c DRL4Sec \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc8fc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 11\uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \ud568\uc815\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uccb4\uacc4\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. 2018\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2025\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 66\uac1c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c DRL4Sec \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ud568\uc815\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd \ube48\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub17c\ubb38\ub2f9 5\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud568\uc815\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (i) \uc790\uc728 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc29\uc5b4, (ii) \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131, (iii) \uc6f9 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud568\uc815\uc774 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c DRL \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac01 \ud568\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad8c\uace0\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-stationarity of real-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks. When developed and deployed safely, ALMA represents a step toward self-improving AI systems that learn to be adaptive, continual learners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uba54\ud0c0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04\uc774 \ub514\uc790\uc778\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 ALMA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ube44\uc0c1\ud0dc\uc131\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ALMA\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uba54\ud0c0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uba54\ud0c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ALMA\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uc81c\uc791 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc124\uacc4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ALMA\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ube44\uc0c1\ud0dc\uc131\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc77c\uc73c\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacfc\uac70 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc81c\uc791\ud55c \uace0\uc815\ud615\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 ALMA(\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uba54\ud0c0 \ud559\uc2b5 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc124\uacc4)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce ParisKV, a drift-robust, GPU-native KV-cache retrieval framework based on collision-based candidate selection, followed by a quantized inner-product reranking estimator. For million-token contexts, ParisKV supports CPU-offloaded KV caches via Unified Virtual Addressing (UVA), enabling on-demand top-$k$ fetching with minimal overhead.

Multi-agent collaboration offers a promising avenue to transcend these boundaries. However, existing frameworks typically rely on prompt-based test-time interactions or multi-role configurations trained with homogeneous parameters, limiting error correction capabilities and strategic diversity. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforced Training and Inference Framework with Self-Search Scaling (MARTI-MARS2), which integrates policy learning with multi-agent tree search by formulating the multi-agent collaborative exploration process as a dynamic and learnable environment. By allowing agents to iteratively explore and refine within the environment, the framework facilitates evolution from parameter-sharing homogeneous multi-role training to heterogeneous multi-agent training, breaking through single-agent capability limits. We also introduce an efficient inference strategy MARTI-MARS2-T+ to fully exploit the scaling potential of multi-agent collaboration at test time. We conduct extensive experiments across varied model scales (8B, 14B, and 32B) on challenging code generation benchmarks. Utilizing two collaborating 32B models, MARTI-MARS2 achieves 77.7%, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-5.1. Furthermore, MARTI-MARS2 reveals a novel scaling law: shifting from single-agent to homogeneous multi-role and ultimately to heterogeneous multi-agent paradigms progressively yields higher RL performance ceilings, robust TTS capabilities, and greater policy diversity, suggesting that policy diversity is critical for scaling intelligence via multi-agent reinforcement learning.", "AI":

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations. Second, we design a data scheduling mechanism that arranges training samples according to a principled hierarchy of difficulty and task taxonomy. Third, we develop a two-stage reinforcement finetuning featuring fine-grained, multi-objective rewards that leverage verifiable process-level CoT data. Extensive experiments show that VeriTime substantially boosts LLM performance across diverse time series reasoning tasks. Notably, it enables compact 3B, 4B models to achieve reasoning capabilities on par with or exceeding those of larger proprietary LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "VeriTime\uc740 LLM\uc744 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubc0f RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc624\ub79c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc774\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc LLM\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc774\ub4e4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1, RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc744 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 VeriTime \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "VeriTime\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Compact 3B \ubc0f 4B \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \ud070 LLM\uacfc \ube44\uc2b7\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ud615\uc73c\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc624\ub79c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804, \ud2b9\ud788 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uc81c\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0(Chain-of-Thought, CoT) \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c LLM \ucd94\ub860 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc740 \uc5f0\ubabb \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5c8\uc6b0\uc801\uac70\ub9ac\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 CoT \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac, \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 CoT \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 RL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc29\ud574\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubc0f RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc744 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 VeriTime \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uacfc\uc815 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c TS-text \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub9ac\ub41c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc640 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubc30\uc5f4\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900 CoT \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc778 2\ub2e8\uacc4 \uac15\ud654 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 VeriTime\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, 3B, 4B \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \ud070 \ub3c5\uc810 LLM\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While recent LLM-based agents show promise, current prompt-based agents for MLE suffer from behavioral stagnation due to frozen parameters. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a remedy, applying it to MLE is hindered by prohibitive execution latency and inefficient data selection. Recognizing these challenges, we propose AceGRPO with two core components: (1) Evolving Data Buffer that continuously repurposes execution traces into reusable training tasks, and (2) Adaptive Sampling guided by a Learnability Potential function, which dynamically prioritizes tasks at the agent's learning frontier to maximize learning efficiency. Leveraging AceGRPO, our trained Ace-30B model achieves a 100% valid submission rate on MLE-Bench-Lite, approaches the performance of proprietary frontier models, and outperforms larger open-source baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-V3.2), demonstrating robust capability for sustained iterative optimization.

However, their efficacy is fundamentally constrained by static configurations governing agent behaviors, which are fixed prior to execution and fail to adapt to evolving task dynamics. Existing approaches, relying on manual orchestration or heuristic-based patches, often struggle with poor generalization and fragmented optimization. To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self. We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability.

Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce Kinetic Path Energy (KPE), an action-like, per-sample diagnostic that measures the accumulated kinetic effort along an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. Empirically, KPE exhibits two robust correspondences: (i) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic fidelity; (ii) high-KPE trajectories terminate on low-density manifold frontiers. We further provide theoretical guarantees linking trajectory energy to data density. Paradoxically, this correlation is non-monotonic. At sufficiently high energy, generation can degenerate into memorization. Leveraging the closed-form of empirical flow matching, we show that extreme energies drive trajectories toward near-copies of training examples. This yields a Goldilocks principle and motivates Kinetic Trajectory Shaping (KTS), a training-free two-phase inference strategy that boosts early motion and enforces a late-time soft landing, reducing memorization and improving generation quality across benchmark tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud750\ub984 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubc00\ub3c4\uc640 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc9c8\ub7c9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c Kinetic Path Energy(KPE)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uc804 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, Kinetic Path Energy(KPE)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801 \ub178\ub825 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc00\ub3c4\uc640\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "KPE\ub294 \uad00\uc2b5\uc801 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd(ODE) \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub530\ub77c \ub204\uc801\ub41c \uc6b4\ub3d9 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc561\uc158 \uc720\uc0ac \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c \uac04\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "KPE\ub294 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, \uace0 KPE \uacbd\ub85c\ub294 \uc800\ubc00\ub3c4 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\ub8cc\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KPE\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c Kinetic Trajectory Shaping(KTS) \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \ucd08\uae30 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ub098\uc911\uc758 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ucc29\ub959\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc5b5\ud654\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ube44\ud6c8\ub828 \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud750\ub984 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc740 \uc2dc\ubcc0 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubb34\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc785\uc790\ub97c \uc774\ub3d9\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uac01 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc740 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\uc804 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Kinetic Path Energy (KPE)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing frameworks encounter a fundamental dilemma between compressing redundant information efficiently and maintaining precise retrieval for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose MemFly, a framework grounded in information bottleneck principles that facilitates on-the-fly memory evolution for LLMs. Our approach minimizes compression entropy while maximizing relevance entropy via a gradient-free optimizer, constructing a stratified memory structure for efficient storage. To fully leverage MemFly, we develop a hybrid retrieval mechanism that seamlessly integrates semantic, symbolic, and topological pathways, incorporating iterative refinement to handle complex multi-hop queries. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MemFly substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in memory coherence, response fidelity, and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemFly\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc555\ucd95\uacfc \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9 \uac04\uc758 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c MemFly \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc555\ucd95 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub828 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MemFly\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uc751\ub2f5 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ucd5c\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MemFly\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubc18\uc1a1\uc2dd \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uacbd\ub85c(\uc758\ubbf8\uc801, \uae30\ud638\uc801, \uc704\uc0c1\uc801)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uac80\uc0c9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc900\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc911\ubcf5 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MemFly\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc555\ucd95 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub828 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc800\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uce35\ud654\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.

Consequently, this multi-task scenario requires addressing critical questions: which tasks are similar, and how and why do they exhibit similarity? In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves.\n  ALE curves are compared using the Fr\u00e9chet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios.\n  We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting. The results demonstrate that the measure aligns with intuitive expectations of task similarity across both tabular and non-tabular data, making it a valuable tool for exploring relationships between

While existing studies augment LLMs with various knowledge types, it remains unclear how effectively the additional costs translate into accuracy. In this paper, we explore how meta-cognition of LLMs, i.e., their self-awareness of their own knowledge states, can regulate the reasoning process. Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density.

Current methods either require heavyweight models at inference or rely on highly sequential imagination, both of which impose prohibitive computational costs. We propose Horizon Imagination (HI), an on-policy imagination process for discrete stochastic policies that denoises multiple future observations in parallel. HI incorporates a stabilization mechanism and a novel sampling schedule that decouples the denoising budget from the effective horizon over which denoising is applied while also supporting sub-frame budgets. Experiments on Atari 100K and Craftium show that our approach maintains control performance with a sub-frame budget of half the denoising steps and achieves superior generation quality under varied schedules.

This ability, collectively known as general continual learning (GCL), encapsulates practical challenges such as online datastreams and blurry task boundaries. Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\\%, 13.36\\%, and 12.56\\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

In long-horizon settings, however, payoffs are shaped by latent strategic externalities that evolve over time, so myopic optimization and variation-based regret analyses can become vacuous even when the dynamics are predictable. To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known.

Identifying valid instruments requires interdisciplinary knowledge, creativity, and contextual understanding, making it a non-trivial task. In this paper, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can aid in this task. We perform a two-stage evaluation framework. First, we test whether LLMs can recover well-established instruments from the literature, assessing their ability to replicate standard reasoning. Second, we evaluate whether LLMs can identify and avoid instruments that have been empirically or theoretically discredited. Building on these results, we introduce IV Co-Scientist, a multi-agent system that proposes, critiques, and refines IVs for a given treatment-outcome pair. We also introduce a statistical test to contextualize consistency in the absence of ground truth.

However, existing threshold determination methods face critical challenges: analytical bounds are overly conservative, while probabilistic approaches like A-ABFT yield thresholds $160$--$4200\\times$ larger than actual rounding errors. We present V-ABFT, a variance-based adaptive threshold algorithm that achieves tighter error bounds by directly modeling the verification difference. By leveraging statistical variance estimation, V-ABFT reduces the threshold-to-actual-error ratio to approximately $7$--$20\\times$ for FP32/FP64 and $48$--$158\\times$ for BF16, representing a \\textbf{6--48$\\times$ improvement} over A-ABFT while maintaining zero false positive rate across BF16, FP16, FP32, and FP64 precisions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for fused-kernel ABFT implementations that verify before output quantization, low-precision GEMM can use FP32-level thresholds ($e_{\\max} \\approx 10^{-6}$), enabling \\textbf{$\\sim$1000$\\times$ finer detection granularity} compared to offline verification with low-precision output ($e_{\\max} \\approx 10^{-3}$). We reproduce A-ABFT's experimental setup and validate our implementation against the original paper's results.

However, as the amount of context grows, their reliability often deteriorates, a phenomenon known as \"context rot\". Existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on single-step settings that evaluate a model's ability to retrieve information from a long snippet. In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context. To assess language agents in such settings, we introduce LOCA-bench (a benchmark for LOng-Context Agents). Given a task prompt, LOCA-bench leverages automated and scalable control of environment states to regulate the agent's context length. This design enables LOCA-bench to extend the context length potentially to infinity in a controlled way while keeping the underlying task semantics fixed. LOCA-bench evaluates language agents as a combination of models and scaffolds, including various context management strategies. While agent performance generally degrades as the environment states grow more complex, advanced context management techniques can substantially improve the overall success rate. We open-source LOCA-bench to provide a platform for evaluating models and scaffolds in long-context, agentic scenarios: https://github.com/hkust-nlp/LOCA-bench", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 '\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc190\uc0c1' \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In Alzheimers disease (AD), multimodal neuroimaging offers complementary signals but VAE-based normative models often (i) fit the healthy reference distribution imperfectly, inflating false positives, and (ii) use posterior aggregation (e.g., PoE/MoE) that can yield weak multimodal fusion in the shared latent space. We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts. Deviation maps highlight region-level patterns aligned with established AD-related changes. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of training objectives that prioritize reference-distribution fidelity and robust multimodal posterior aggregation for normative modeling, with implications for deviation-based analysis across multimodal clinical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "mmSIVAE\ub294 \ud63c\ud569-\uc0dd\uc0b0\uc790 \uc9d1\ud569(MOPOE) \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc131 \ubcc0\ud615 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub85c, \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38 \ubcd1\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc38\uc870 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38 \ubcd1\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac74\uac15\ud55c \ucc38\uc870 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uac1c\uc778\ubcc4 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 mmSIVAE\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc131 \ubcc0\ud615 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc640 MOPOE \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ucc38\uc870\uc758 \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "mmSIVAE\ub294 ADNI MRI \uc9c0\uc5ed \ubcfc\ub968 \ubc0f \uc544\ubc00\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc PET SUVR\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc874\ub41c \ud1b5\uc81c\uad70\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc0c1\uac12 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub354 \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub41c \ud3b8\ucc28 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uac74\uac15\ud55c \ucc38\uc870 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud6c4\ubc29 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc784\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ud3b8\ucc28 \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\uaddc \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc740 \uac74\uac15\ud55c \ucc38\uc870 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38\ubcd1(AD)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc2e0\uacbd \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc740 \ubcf4\uc644 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, VAE \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\uaddc \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud754\ud788 (i) \uac74\uac15\ud55c \ucc38\uc870 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc644\ubcbd\ud558\uac8c \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc591\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0, (ii) \uc57d\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc735\ud569\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c4\ubc29 \uc9d1\ud569(\uc608: PoE/MoE)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucc38\uc870\uc758 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) \uc9d1\ud569\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc131 \ubcc0\ud615 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(mnmSIVAE)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \uac74\uac15\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac70\ub9ac\ub85c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3b8\ucc28 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While recent data-driven methods promise to accelerate parts of this process, they largely fail to support end-to-end scientific discovery. To address this gap, we introduce EXPERIGEN, an agentic framework that operationalizes end-to-end discovery through a Bayesian optimization inspired two-phase search, in which a Generator proposes candidate hypotheses and an Experimenter evaluates them empirically. Across multiple domains, EXPERIGEN consistently discovers 2-4x more statistically significant hypotheses that are 7-17 percent more predictive than prior approaches, and naturally extends to complex data regimes including multimodal and relational datasets. Beyond statistical performance, hypotheses must be novel, empirically grounded, and actionable to drive real scientific progress. To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty. Among 25 reviewed hypotheses, 88 percent were rated moderately or strongly novel, 70 percent were deemed impactful and worth pursuing, and most demonstrated rigor comparable to senior graduate-level research. Finally, recognizing that ultimate validation requires real-world evidence, we conduct the first A/B test of LLM-generated hypotheses, observing statistically significant results with p less than 1e-6

On Llama 3.1 8B, our method achieves 97.7\\% recall with multi-feature detection and 86.1\\% recall with 81.0\\% precision for balanced deployment, without requiring any labeled training data. Most remarkably, we discover that single layer spectral features act as near-perfect hallucination detectors: Llama L26 Smoothness achieves 98.2\\% recall (213/217 hallucinations caught) with a single threshold, and Mistral L3 Entropy achieves 94.7\\% recall. This suggests hallucination is not merely a wrong token but a thermodynamic state change: the model's attention becomes noise when it errs. Through controlled cross-model evaluation on matched domains ($N=1000$, $T=0.3$, same General domain, hallucination rates 20--22\\%), we reveal the ``Loud Liar'' phenomenon: Llama 3.1 8B's failures are spectrally catastrophic and dramatically easier to detect, while Mistral 7B achieves the best discrimination (AUC 0.900).

However, the substantial burden of manual orchestration inherently raises an imperative to automate the design of agentic workflows. We frame such an agent coordination challenge as a classic problem in dynamic ad-hoc networking: How to establish adaptive and reliable communication among a scalable number of agentic hosts? In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers. Extensive experiments over five benchmarks showcase that our design effectively reconciles adaptivity, scalability, and robustness in a unified multi-agent coordination framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c RAPS\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4 \ud544\uc694\uc131 \uc99d\uac00", "method": "RAPS\ub77c\ub294 \ud3c9\ud310 \uc778\uc2dd \ud37c\ube14\ub9ac\uc2dc-\uad6c\ub3c5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815", "result": "\ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc801\uc751\uc131, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131, \uac15\uc778\ud568\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d", "conclusion": "RAPS\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc798 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad70\uc9d1 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubd80\ub2f4\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\ud750\ub984 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc560\ub4dc\ud639 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud0b9\uc758 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4: \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud560 \uac83\uc778\uac00? \uc774 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\ud310 \uc778\uc2dd \ud37c\ube14\ub9ac\uc2dc-\uad6c\ub3c5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 RAPS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Project page: https://konstantinosmitsides.github.io/dreaming-in-code", "summary": "Open-ended learning frames intelligence as emerging from continual interaction with an ever-expanding space of environments. While recent advances have utilized foundation models to programmatically generate diverse environments, these approaches often focus on discovering isolated behaviors rather than orchestrating sustained progression. In complex open-ended worlds, the large combinatorial space of possible challenges makes it difficult for agents to discover sequences of experiences that remain consistently learnable. To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, \"dreaming\" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a $16\\%$ improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail. Our results suggest that code-level environment design provides a practical mechanism for curriculum control, enabling the construction of intermediate environments that bridge competence gaps in open-ended worlds.

However, real-world clinical needs include not only effectiveness, but also reliability and reasonable deployment cost. Since clinical decision-making is inherently collaborative, we challenge the monolithic scaling paradigm and ask whether a Small Agent Group (SAG) can support better clinical reasoning. SAG shifts from single-model intelligence to collective expertise by distributing reasoning, evidence-based analysis, and critical audit through a collaborative deliberation process. To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation. These findings suggest that the synergistic reasoning represented by SAG can substitute for model parameter growth in clinical settings.

Existing memory-based methods primarily store raw trajectories, which are often redundant and noise-heavy. This prevents agents from extracting high-level, reusable behavioral patterns that are essential for generalization. In this paper, we propose SkillRL, a framework that bridges the gap between raw experience and policy improvement through automatic skill discovery and recursive evolution. Our approach introduces an experience-based distillation mechanism to build a hierarchical skill library SkillBank, an adaptive retrieval strategy for general and task-specific heuristics, and a recursive evolution mechanism that allows the skill library to co-evolve with the agent's policy during reinforcement learning. These innovations significantly reduce the token footprint while enhancing reasoning utility. Experimental results on ALFWorld, WebShop and seven search-augmented tasks demonstrate that SkillRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines over 15.3% and maintaining robustness as task complexity increases.

Traditional methods struggle to balance minimizing Total Weighted Tardiness (TWT) and Total Setup Time (TST). This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN effectively represents the complex state of jobs, machines, and setups, allowing the PPO agent to learn a direct scheduling policy. Guided by a multi-objective reward function, the agent simultaneously minimizes TWT and TST. Experimental results on benchmark instances demonstrate that our PPO-GNN agent significantly outperforms a standard dispatching rule and a metaheuristic, achieving a superior trade-off between both objectives. This provides a robust and scalable solution for complex manufacturing scheduling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c UPMSP \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \uc81c\uc548", "motivation": "UPMSP \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "PPO\uc640 GNN\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5, \uae30\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc124\uce58\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, PPO-GNN \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc30\uce58 \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \uba54\ud0c0 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70 TWT\uc640 TST \uac04\uc758 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc81c\uc870 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9b4\ub9ac\uc2a4 \ub0a0\uc9dc, \uc124\uc815 \ubc0f \uc801\uaca9\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ube44\uad00\ub828 \ubcd1\ub82c \uae30\uacc4 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c(UPMSP)\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd1d \uac00\uc911 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04(TWT)\uacfc \ucd1d \uc124\uce58 \uc2dc\uac04(TST) \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc7a1\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(PPO)\uc640 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Analysing the Learning Efficiency of Agentic Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for training or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), enabling adaptive, task-specific optimizations through interactive feedback. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), in particular, offers a promising avenue by decomposing complex tasks into specialized subtasks learned by distinct interacting agents, potentially enhancing the ability and efficiency of LLM systems. However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MARL improves sample complexity when tasks naturally decompose into independent subtasks, whereas dependent subtasks diminish MARL's comparative advantage. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the concept of task alignment, quantifying the trade-offs when enforcing independent task decomposition despite potential misalignments. These theoretical insights clarify empirical inconsistencies and provide practical criteria for deploying MARL strategies effectively in complex LLM scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

In this paper, we identify this assumption as Dogma 4 of Reinforcement Learning (RL). We demonstrate that while this dogma holds in static environments, it fails in social settings where evaluators may be sycophantic, lazy, or adversarial. We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this \"judging the judges\" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased. Empirically, we show that while traditional consensus methods fail under majority collusion, our approach successfully recovers the optimal policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uc7ac\uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc778 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc2a4\ud14c\ubbf9 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc815\ub82c(ESA)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 AI \uc815\ub82c \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc774\ub97c \uc7ac\uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 RL\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubbff\uc74c\uc778 '\uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc740 \uc9c4\uc2e4\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub2e4'\ub97c Dogma 4\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc758 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c ESA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Dogma 4 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 '\ubaa9\uc801 \ubd84\ub9ac(Objective Decoupling)' \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0, ESA \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ESA\ub294 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub41c \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 AI \uc815\ub82c \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc2dc\ub044\ub7fd\uae34 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\uc2e4\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub77c\ub294 \ubbf8\uc57d\ud55c \uc804\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc758 \uad50\ub9ac 4\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uad50\ub9ac\uac00 \uc815\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc131\ub9bd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uac00 \uc544\ucca8\ud558\uac70\ub098, \uac8c\uc73c\ub974\uac70\ub098, \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad50\ub9ac 4 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 '\ubaa9\uc801 \ubd84\ub9ac(Objective Decoupling)'\ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ub974\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9ac\uba74\uc11c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc9c4\uc2e4\uacfc \uc601\uad6c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ub418\uba70, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc815\ub82c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud558\uac8c \ub428\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc2a4\ud14c\ubbf9 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc815\ub82c(ESA)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, they do not work well for deep chains. The root cause of this limitation stems from the Semantic Entanglement problem in these extended workflows. In standard textual backpropagation, feedback signals mix local critiques with upstream contexts, leading to Attribution Ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose TextResNet, a framework that reformulates the optimization process to achieve precise signal routing via four key innovations. Firstly, in the forward pass, it enforces Additive Semantic Deltas to preserve an Identity Highway for gradient flow. Secondly, in the backward pass, it introduces Semantic Gradient Decomposition via a Semantic Projector to disentangle feedback into causally independent subspaces. Thirdly, it implements Causal Routing, which routes projected signals to their specific components. Finally, it performs Density-Aware Optimization Scheduling to leverage the disentangled signals to dynamically allocate resources to key system bottlenecks. Our results show that TextResNet not only achieves superior performance compared to TextGrad, but also exhibits remarkable stability for agentic tasks in compound AI systems where baselines collapse.

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \ubd84\ud3ec \ub0b4 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc640 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 RLBF \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "RLBF\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub0ae\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RLBF\ub294 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ube44\ud310\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \ubd84\ud3ec \ub0b4 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c4\uc9c4 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLBF)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 BSAFE\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ucf1c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c RL\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, LLM\uc740 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ubc18 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc5d0 \ub9de\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \"x \ud1a0\ud070\ub9cc\ud07c \ud6c4\uc9c4\" \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ubc1c\uc2e0\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uacc4\uc18d\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 RL \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \ucc44\uc6b0\uae30, \ud0d0\uc695\uc801\uc778 \uc88c\ud45c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8(GCG) \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc870\uc791\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud6c4\uc9c4 \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \uc2b5\ub4dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uac10\ub3c5 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815(SFT) \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5(BSAFE+)\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc6d0\ub798 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\uc9c4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd08\uae30 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, RLBF\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ube44\ud310\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an \"empathy trap,\" providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction. Findings reveal vulnerabilities requiring mitigation before clinical trials.

While existing methods continue to reinforce target predictions, we find that informative supervision signals remain latent in models' own historical weak states. Motivated by this observation, we propose WMSS (Weak Agents Can Make Strong Agents Stronger), a post-training paradigm that leverages weak checkpoints to guide continued optimization. By identifying recoverable learning gaps via entropy dynamics and reinforcing them through compensatory learning, WMSS enables strong agents to improve beyond conventional post-training saturation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation datasets show that agents trained with our approach achieve effective performance improvements, while incurring zero additional inference cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "WMSS\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc57d\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uc911\uc2ec\uc774 \ub418\uba74\uc11c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uba74 \ucd94\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uc218\uc775\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud3ec\ud654 \ubcf4\ud2c0\ub125\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "WMSS(\uc57d\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac15\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub354 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4)\ub294 \uc57d\ud55c \uccb4\ud06c\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud68c\ubcf5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ucd94\uac00 \ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "WMSS\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud3ec\ud654 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "translated_summary": "\ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc2ec\uc774 \ub418\uba74\uc11c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uac8c \ub418\uba74 \ucd94\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud3ec\ud654 \ubcf4\ud2c0\ub125\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacfc\uac70 \uc57d\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 WMSS(\uc57d\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac15\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub354 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc57d\ud55c \uccb4\ud06c\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud68c\ubcf5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, WMSS\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud3ec\ud654 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Model merging offers a compelling alternative by directly integrating the weights of multiple source models without requiring additional data or extensive training. However, conventional model merging techniques, such as parameter averaging, often suffer from the unintended combination of non-generalizable features, especially when source models exhibit significant weight disparities. Comparatively, model ensembling generally provides more stable and superior performance that aggregates multiple models by averaging outputs. However, it incurs higher inference costs and increased storage requirements. While previous studies experimentally showed the similarities between model merging and ensembling, theoretical evidence and evaluation metrics remain lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies the compatibility of merging source models using very limited unlabeled data. By measuring the discrepancy between parameter averaging and model ensembling at layer and node levels, M-Loss facilitates more effective merging strategies. Specifically, M-Loss serves both as a quantitative criterion of the theoretical feasibility of model merging, and a guide for parameter significance in model pruning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate that incorporating M-Loss into the merging process significantly improves the alignment between merged models and model ensembling, providing a scalable and efficient framework for accurate model consolidation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ubcd1\ud569\uc740 \ucd94\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub098 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc548\uc774\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcd1\ud569 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc758 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uacb0\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ud1b5\ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ubcd1\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcd1\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "M-Loss\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubcd1\ud569 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc640 \ub178\ub4dc \ub808\ubca8\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubcd1\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "M-Loss\ub97c \ubcd1\ud569 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubcd1\ud569\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "M-Loss\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubcd1\ud569\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc900 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc885\uc885 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \ubcd1\ud569\uc740 \ucd94\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub098 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubcd1\ud569 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc774 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c \ube44\uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\uce58 \uc54a\uc740 \uacb0\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc885\uc885 \uace0\ud1b5\ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc800\uc7a5 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubcd1\ud569\uacfc \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubcd1\ud569\uc758 \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc778 Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Owing to the increasing importance of algorithmic fairness, we consider the problem of computing PR vectors subject to various group-fairness criteria based on sensitive attributes of the vertices. At present, principled algorithms for this problem are lacking - some cannot guarantee that a target fairness level is achieved, while others do not feature optimality guarantees. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we put forth a unified in-processing convex optimization framework, termed FairRARI, for tackling different group-fairness criteria in a ``plug and play'' fashion. Leveraging a variational formulation of PR, the framework computes fair PR vectors by solving a strongly convex optimization problem with fairness constraints, thereby ensuring that a target fairness level is achieved. We further introduce three different fairness criteria which can be efficiently tackled using FairRARI to compute fair PR vectors with the same asymptotic time-complexity as the original PR algorithm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets showcase that FairRARI outperforms existing methods in terms of utility, while achieving the desired fairness levels across multiple vertex groups; thereby highlighting its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec PageRank \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 FairRARI\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uadf8\ub8f9 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 PR \ubca1\ud130 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PR\uc758 \ubcc0\ubd84 \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ud55c \ubcfc\ub85d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c PR \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ubcfc\ub85d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FairRARI\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "FairRARI\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70, \uc6d0\ub798 PR \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc810\uadfc\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub85c \uacf5\uc815\ud55c PR \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, FairRARI\uac00 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc815\uc810 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "PageRank (PR)\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\uc810\uc758 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c PR \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba70, \uc77c\ubd80\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uace0, \ub2e4\ub978 \uc77c\ubd80\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc744 '\ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774' \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ucc98\ub9ac \uc911 \ubcfc\ub85d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FairRARI\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Meanwhile, the rapid proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents has intensified demand for highly personalized services that require the dynamic provision of diverse personal data. This presents a significant challenge: balancing the utilization of such data with privacy protection. To address this challenge, we propose Puda (Private User Dataset Agent), a user-sovereign architecture that aggregates data across services and enables client-side management. Puda allows users to control data sharing at three privacy levels: (i) Detailed Browsing History, (ii) Extracted Keywords, and (iii) Predefined Category Subsets. We implemented Puda as a browser-based system that serves as a common platform across diverse services and evaluated it through a personalized travel planning task. Our results show that providing Predefined Category Subsets achieves 97.2% of the personalization performance (evaluated via an LLM-as-a-Judge framework across three criteria) obtained when sharing Detailed Browsing History. These findings demonstrate that Puda enables effective multi-granularity management, offering practical choices to mitigate the privacy-personalization trade-off. Overall, Puda provides an AI-native foundation for user sovereignty, empowering users to safely leverage the full potential of personalized AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Puda\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\ud654\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc8fc\uad8c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc81c\uacf5\uc5c5\uccb4 \uac04\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\ud654\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc8fc\uad8c\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Puda\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc218\uc900(\uc0c1\uc138 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc9d5 \uc774\ub825, \ucd94\ucd9c\ub41c \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc, \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc815\uc758\ub41c \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74 \uc0c1\uc138 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc9d5 \uc774\ub825\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud560 \ub54c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 97.2%\ub97c \uc5bb\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Puda\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc81c\uacf5\uc5c5\uccb4 \uac04\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\ud654\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc8fc\uad8c\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\ub0c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ud655\uc0b0\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694\ub97c \ucd09\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Puda(\uac1c\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, most existing synthesis strategies focus on maintaining statistical information. Although some studies address prediction performance guarantees, their single-stage synthesis designs make it challenging to balance the privacy requirements that necessitate significant perturbations and the prediction performance that is sensitive to such perturbations. We propose a two-stage synthesis strategy. In the first stage, we introduce a synthesis-then-hybrid strategy, which involves a synthesis operation to generate pure synthetic data, followed by a hybrid operation that fuses the synthetic data with the original data. In the second stage, we present a kernel ridge regression (KRR)-based synthesis strategy, where a KRR model is first trained on the original data and then used to generate synthetic outputs based on the synthetic inputs produced in the first stage. By leveraging the theoretical strengths of KRR and the covariant distribution retention achieved in the first stage, our proposed two-stage synthesis strategy enables a statistics-driven restricted privacy--prediction trade-off and guarantee optimal prediction performance. We validate our approach and demonstrate its characteristics of being statistics-driven and restricted in achieving the privacy--prediction trade-off both theoretically and numerically. Additionally, we showcase its generalizability through applications to a marketing problem and five real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc21c\uc218 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc735\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucee4\ub110 \ub9bf\uc9c0 \ud68c\uadc0(KRR) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\uc131 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc0f \uc218\uce58\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub9c8\ucf00\ud305 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud558\uc704 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ud569\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubd80 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud569\uc131 \uc124\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud070 \uc65c\uace1\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uacfc \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \uc65c\uace1\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud569\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc21c\uc218 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc735\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ud569\uc131-\ud6c4-\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucee4\ub110 \ub9bf\uc9c0 \ud68c\uadc0(KRR) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c KRR \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0 \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5\ub418\uace0, \uc774\ud6c4 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\uc131 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We argue that this fragmentation largely stems from the absence of an analyzable, self-consistent formal model that enables implementation-independent characterization and comparison of LLM agents. To address this gap, we propose the \\texttt{Structural Context Model}, a formal model for analyzing and comparing LLM agents from the perspective of context structure. Building upon this foundation, we introduce two complementary components that together span the full lifecycle of LLM agent research and development: (1) a declarative implementation framework; and (2) a sustainable agent engineering workflow, \\texttt{Semantic Dynamics Analysis}. The proposed workflow provides principled insights into agent mechanisms and supports rapid, systematic design iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the complete framework on dynamic variants of the monkey-banana problem, where agents engineered using our approach achieve up to a 32 percentage points improvement in success rate on the most challenging setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud604\uc7ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

SHARP: Shapley Credit-based Optimization for Multi-Agent System", "comment": null, "summary": "Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via multi-agent systems offers a promising new paradigm for decomposing and solving complex problems. However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHARP\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "SHARP\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc0c1, \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c Shapley \uae30\ubc18 \ud55c\uacc4 \uae30\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1, \uc2e4\ud589 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c-\ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubd84\ud574\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcc4 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SHARP\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 23.66% \ubc0f 14.05%\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SHARP\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uadf9\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uc815 \uada4\ub3c4\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc774\ub098 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ud2b9\uc815 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucc45\uc784\uc774 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uac1c\ubcc4 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Shapley \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4 \ud560\ub2f9(SHARP)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce an active probabilistic reasoning task that cleanly separates sampling (actively acquiring evidence) from inference (integrating evidence toward a decision). Benchmarking humans and a broad set of contemporary large language models against near-optimal reference policies reveals a consistent pattern: extended reasoning is the key determinant of strong performance, driving large gains in inference and producing belief trajectories that become strikingly human-like, while yielding only modest improvements in active sampling. To explain these differences, we fit a mechanistic model that captures systematic deviations from optimal behavior via four interpretable latent variables: memory, strategy, choice bias, and occlusion awareness.

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c MemAdapter\ub77c\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4Cross-paradigm Genralization\uacfc Fusion\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MemAdapter\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc11c\ube0c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uac80\uc0c9\uae30\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \ub300\ube44 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc815\ub82c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MemAdapter\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uacfc \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MemAdapter\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc735\ud569\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ub9ac \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801, \ub9e4\uac1c \ubcc0\uc218\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \uc735\ud569\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uae34\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc885 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uccab \uac78\uc74c\uc744 \ub0b4\ub51b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uac04\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MemAdapter\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we theoretically pinpoint a key reason for training instability when extending group-based RL to multi-agent LLM systems. We show that under GRPO-style optimization, a global normalization baseline may deviate from diverse agents' reward distributions, which ultimately leads to gradient-norm instability. Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends. We evaluate Dr. MAS on multi-agent math reasoning and multi-turn search benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 series models. Dr. MAS achieves clear gains over vanilla GRPO (e.g., +5.6\\% avg@16 and +4.6\\% pass@16 on math, and +15.2\\% avg@16 and +13.1\\% pass@16 on search) while largely eliminating gradient spikes. Moreover, it remains highly effective under heterogeneous agent-model assignments while improving efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc778 Dr. MAS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5ed\ud560 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\uae09 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GRPO \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, Dr. MAS\ub294 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud1b5\uacc4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uc810(normalize advantages)\uc744 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub098 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 RL \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Dr. MAS\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ud68c\uc804 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c Qwen2.5 \ubc0f Qwen3 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Project page. https://openreview.net/forum?id=wb05ver1k8&noteId=v1Ax8CwI71", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as planners for embodied AI, but their stochastic nature lacks formal reasoning, preventing strict safety guarantees for physical deployment. Current approaches often rely on unreliable LLMs for safety checks or simply reject unsafe plans without offering repairs. We introduce the Verifiable Iterative Refinement Framework (VIRF), a neuro-symbolic architecture that shifts the paradigm from passive safety gatekeeping to active collaboration. Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average.

We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud589\ub3d9

In distributed and access-restricted settings (e.g., hospitals or multinational organizations), retrieval must select relevant domains and appropriate traversal depth without global graph visibility or exhaustive querying. To address this challenge, we introduce \\textbf{SCOUT-RAG} (\\textit{\\underline{S}calable and \\underline{CO}st-efficient \\underline{U}nifying \\underline{T}raversal}), a distributed agentic Graph-RAG framework that performs progressive cross-domain retrieval guided by incremental utility goals. SCOUT-RAG employs four cooperative agents that: (i) estimate domain relevance, (ii) decide when to expand retrieval to additional domains, (iii) adapt traversal depth to avoid unnecessary graph exploration, and (iv) synthesize the high-quality answers. The framework is designed to minimize retrieval regret, defined as missing useful domain information, while controlling latency and API cost. Across multi-domain knowledge settings, SCOUT-RAG achieves performance comparable to centralized baselines, including DRIFT and exhaustive domain traversal, while substantially reducing cross-domain calls, total tokens processed, and latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCOUT-RAG\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \uc800\ube44\uc6a9 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc774 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\ud654\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ubd84\uc0b0\ub418\uace0 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "SCOUT-RAG\ub294 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc778 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ub41c \uc9c4\ubcf4\uc801\uc778 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud611\ub825 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uac00 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc2dc\uae30\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uba70, \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uae4a\uc774\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud558\uace0 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc885\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SCOUT-RAG\ub294 DRIFT \ubc0f \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud638\ucd9c, \ucc98\ub9ac\ub41c \ucd1d \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218 \ubc0f \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub300\ud3ed \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub193\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba70 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc API \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Graph-RAG\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc0b0\ub418\uace0 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd(\uc608: \ubcd1\uc6d0\uc774\ub098 \ub2e4\uad6d\uc801 \uc870\uc9c1)\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uc138\uacc4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uac00\uc2dc\uc131\uc774\ub098 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uad00\ub828 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uae4a\uc774\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc778 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ub41c \uc9c4\ubcf4\uc801\uc778 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 Graph-RAG \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SCOUT-RAG(\ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud0d0\uc0c9)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

This difficulty partly arises from the natural rarity of certain classes (or hierarchical nodes) and the hierarchical constraint that ensures child nodes are almost always less frequent than their parents. To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties. By emphasizing rare nodes rather than rare observations (data points), and focusing on uncertain nodes for each model output distribution during training, we observe improvements in recall by up to a factor of five on benchmark datasets, along with statistically significant gains in $F_{1}$ score. We also show our approach aids convolutional networks on challenging tasks, as in situations with suboptimal encoders or limited data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac00\uc911 \uc190\uc2e4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uae4a\uc740 \uc218\uc900 \ub3c4\ub2ec\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub178\ub4dc\ubcc4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc640 \ud604\ub300\uc801 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ucd08\uc810 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uac00\uc911 \uc190\uc2e4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\ud604\uc728\uc774 \ucd5c\ub300 5\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, $F_{1}$ \uc810\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub098 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uc0c1\uc138\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4(\ub610\ub294 \uacc4\uce35 \ub178\ub4dc)\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc801\uc778 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uacfc \uc790\uc2dd \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \ubd80\ubaa8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac70\uc758 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ub35c \ube48\ubc88\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub178\ub4dc\ubcc4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc640 \ud604\ub300\uc801 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc758 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ucd08\uc810 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac00\uc911 \uc190\uc2e4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub4dc\ubb38 \uad00\ucc30(\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8)\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \ub4dc\ubb38 \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uac15\uc870\ub97c \ub450\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \uac01 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\ud604\uc728\uc774 \ucd5c\ub300 5\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uace0 $F_{1}$ \uc810\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud588\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub098 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc900\ub2e4."}}

While previous benchmarks like OpenCaptchaWorld established a baseline for evaluating multimodal agents, recent advancements in reasoning-heavy models, such as Gemini3-Pro-High and GPT-5.2-Xhigh have effectively collapsed this security barrier, achieving pass rates as high as 90% on complex logic puzzles like \"Bingo\". In response, we introduce Next-Gen CAPTCHAs, a scalable defense framework designed to secure the next-generation web against the advanced agents. Unlike static datasets, our benchmark is built upon a robust data generation pipeline, allowing for large-scale and easily scalable evaluations, notably, for backend-supported types, our system is capable of generating effectively unbounded CAPTCHA instances. We exploit the persistent human-agent \"Cognitive Gap\" in interactive perception, memory, decision-making, and action.

However, existing agent security research and evaluation frameworks primarily focus on synthetic or task-centric settings, and thus fail to accurately capture the attack surface and risk propagation mechanisms of personalized agents in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we propose Personalized Agent Security Bench (PASB), an end-to-end security evaluation framework tailored for real-world personalized agents. Building upon existing agent attack paradigms, PASB incorporates personalized usage scenarios, realistic toolchains, and long-horizon interactions, enabling black-box, end-to-end security evaluation on real systems. Using OpenClaw as a representative case study, we systematically evaluate its security across multiple personalized scenarios, tool capabilities, and attack types. Our results indicate that OpenClaw exhibits critical vulnerabilities at different execution stages, including user prompt processing, tool usage, and memory retrieval, highlighting substantial security risks in personalized agent deployments.

The natural properties of Tensor, especially the memory-continuity and slice-independence, make it feasible for training system to leverage parallel computing unit like GPU to process data simultaneously in batch, spatial or temporal dimensions. However, if we look beyond perception tasks, the data in a complicated cognitive AI system usually has hierarchical structures (i.e. nested data) with various modalities. They are inconvenient and inefficient to program directly with conventional Tensor with fixed shape. To address this issue, we summarize two main computational patterns of nested data, and then propose a general nested data container: TreeTensor. Through various constraints and magic utilities of TreeTensor, one can apply arbitrary functions and operations to nested data with almost zero cost, including some famous machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy and PyTorch. Our approach utilizes a constrained tree-structure perspective to systematically model data relationships, and it can also easily be combined with other methods to extend more usages, such as asynchronous execution and variable-length data computation. Detailed examples and benchmarks show TreeTensor not only provides powerful usability in various problems, especially one of the most complicated AI systems at present: AlphaStar for StarCraftII, but also exhibits excellent runtime efficiency without any overhead.

This regime can systematically under-estimate a fixed model's true capability: many errors arise not from missing knowledge, but from premature commitment under internal ambiguity. We introduce \\emph{Reinforcement Inference}, an entropy-aware inference-time control strategy that uses the model's own uncertainty to selectively invoke a second, more deliberate reasoning attempt, enabling stronger performance \\emph{without any retraining}.\n  On 12,032 MMLU-Pro questions across 14 subjects, using DeepSeek-v3.2 with deterministic decoding in a zero-shot setting, Reinforcement Inference improves accuracy from 60.72\\% to 84.03\\%, while only incurring 61.06\\% additional inference calls. A 100\\% re-asking ablation reaches 84.35\\%, indicating that uncertainty-aware selection captures most of the attainable improvement with substantially less compute. Moreover, a \\emph{prompt-only} ablation underperforms the baseline, suggesting that the gains are not explained by generic `` your output had high entropy, think step-by-step'' prompting alone.\n  Beyond providing a practical inference-time upgrade, our results suggest a broader \\emph{entropy-aware} paradigm for measuring and expanding model capability: because modern decoder-based models generate outputs autoregressively, entropy and related confidence measures arise naturally as first-class control signals during generation. The resulting gap between one-pass greedy inference and uncertainty-conditioned deliberation offers a diagnostic lens on an LLM's latent reasoning horizon and motivates future training objectives that

Adopting a two-agent game paradigm, a user agent constructs dynamic environments via style mimicry (learning user-specific conversational traits) and active termination (predicting turn-level termination probabilities as immediate rewards), forming an iterative cycle that drives the dialogue agent to deepen interest exploration. AT-GRPO reinterprets dialogue trajectories as trees and introduces adaptive observation ranges. Unlike full tree expansion that incurs exponential overhead, it limits each node to aggregate rewards from a stage-aware range: larger ranges support early-stage topic exploration, while smaller ranges facilitate late-stage dialogue maintenance. This design reduces rollout budgets from exponential to polynomial in the dialogue length, while preserving long-term reward capture. Extensive experiments show our framework's superior performance, sample efficiency, and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \ub2e8\uae30 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc218\ud3c9 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc5d4\ub514\ub4dc \ub300\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "Adaptive Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO)\uc640 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30 \uc218\ud3c9 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AT-GRPO\ub294 \ub300\ud654 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub85c \uc7ac\ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uad00\ucc30 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub300\ud654 \uae38\uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \ub2e4\ud56d\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc7a5\uae30 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ub300\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30 \ub300\ud654 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uae30 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uc640 Adaptive Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc218\ud3c9 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac8c\uc784 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \ubaa8\ubc29(\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \ub300\ud654 \ud2b9\uc131 \ud559\uc2b5)\uacfc \uc801\uadf9\uc801 \uc885\ub8cc(\ud68c\uc804 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\ub8cc \ud655\ub960 \uc608\uce21) \ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub300\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uad00\uc2ec \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc2ec\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic, lacking principled guidance on what drives performance gains and how to systematically optimize multi-agent reasoning. Specifically, it remains unclear why multi-agent collaboration outperforms single-agent reasoning and which design choices contribute most to these gains, making it difficult to build better systems.\n  We address this gap by introducing a unified theoretical framework that decomposes multi-agent reasoning gains into three conceptually independent dimensions: Exploration for diverse solution coverage, Information for high-fidelity feedback, and Aggregation for principled consensus. Through this lens, existing methods can be understood as special cases that optimize only subsets of these dimensions. Building upon this decomposition, a novel framework called PRISM (Propose-Review-Integrate Synthesis for Multi-agent Reasoning) is proposed, which jointly maximizes all three dimensions through role-based diversity, execution-grounded feedback with evidence-based cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis with closed-loop validation. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and function calling benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior compute-efficiency compared to methods optimizing partial dimensions. The theoretical framework provides actionable design principles for future multi-agent reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825\uc774 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8

Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: unified embedding retrieval, which suffers from single-model myopia, and heuristic agentic retrieval, which is limited by suboptimal, trial-and-error orchestration. To this end, we propose OSCAR, an optimization-steered agentic planning framework for composed image retrieval. We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a private industrial benchmark show that OSCAR consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Notably, it achieves superior performance using only 10% of training data, demonstrating strong generalization of planning logic rather than dataset-specific memorization.", "AI": {"tldr": "OSCAR\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub300\uc2e0 \ucd5c\uc801 \uada4\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\ud569 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uac80\uc0c9(CIR)\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ubc0f \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "OSCAR\ub294 CIR\uc744 \uc6d0\uc790 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc870\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\uc218 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "OSCAR\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uacf5\uac1c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubbfc\uac04 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c SOTA \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "OSCAR\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ub2e8 10%\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131, \uacc4\ud68d \ub17c\ub9ac\uc758 \uac15\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\ud569 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uac80\uc0c9(CIR)\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ubc0f \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub258\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378 \uadfc\uc2dc \ubc0f \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc720\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 OSCAR\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 CIR\uc744 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This is a full version that includes the supplementary material", "summary": "Value-aware AI should recognise human values and adapt to the value systems (value-based preferences) of different users. This requires operationalization of values, which can be prone to misspecification. The social nature of values demands their representation to adhere to multiple users while value systems are diverse, yet exhibit patterns among groups. In sequential decision making, efforts have been made towards personalization for different goals or values from demonstrations of diverse agents. However, these approaches demand manually designed features or lack value-based interpretability and/or adaptability to diverse user preferences.\n  We propose algorithms for learning models of value alignment and value systems for a society of agents in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), based on clustering and preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PbMORL). We jointly learn socially-derived value alignment models (groundings) and a set of value systems that concisely represent different groups of users (clusters) in a society. Each cluster consists of a value system representing the value-based preferences of its members and an approximately Pareto-optimal policy that reflects behaviours aligned with this value system.

We introduce CoRefine, a confidence-guided self-refinement method that achieves competitive accuracy using a fraction of the tokens via a lightweight 211k-parameter Conv1D controller atop a frozen LLM. The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification. We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoRefine\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c Conv1D \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc815\uc81c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ubcd1\ub82c \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc18c\ubaa8\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "CoRefine\ub294 211k \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 Conv1D \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \ucd94\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uc9c0, \uc7ac\uac80\ud1a0 \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CoRefine\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 2.7\uac1c \uc815\uc81c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc57d 190\ubc30\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ud655\uc2e0\uc774 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c\ub294 92.6%\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \uc815\ub2f5 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc758 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, CoRefine\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\uae30\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \uc6d0\uc2dc\uae30\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ubcd1\ub82c \ub514\ucf54\ub529(\uc608: 512\uac1c \uc0d8\ud50c)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uacb0\ub41c LLM \uc704\uc5d0 \uacbd\ub7c9 211k \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 Conv1D \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub97c \ub450\uc5b4 \uc77c\ubd80 \ud1a0\ud070\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\uae30 \uc815\uc81c \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 CoRefine\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \ucd94\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\ub2e8, \uc7ac\uac80\ud1a0 \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 2.7\uac1c\uc758 \uc815\uc81c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c\ub2f9 \uc57d 190\ubc30\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc774\ub8ec\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc138 \uac1c\uc758 \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc774 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub294 \ud655\uc2e0\uc774 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c 92.6%\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc758 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc9c4\uc2e4 \uac80\uc99d \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ucc29\ucde8\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \uc21c\ucc28-\ubcd1\ub82c \ubcc0\ud615\uc778 CoRefine-Tree\ub85c \uc774\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uac04\ud3b8\ud55c \uc81c\uacf5 \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d\uae30 \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \uc815\ub2f5 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc758 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, CoRefine\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\uae30\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \uc6d0\uc2dc\uae30\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Khajavi"], "title": "Digital Twin and Agentic AI for Wild Fire Disaster Management: Intelligent Virtual Situation Room", "comment": null, "summary": "According to the United Nations, wildfire frequency and intensity are projected to increase by approximately 14% by 2030 and 30% by 2050 due to global warming, posing critical threats to life, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Conventional disaster management frameworks rely on static simulations and passive data acquisition, hindering their ability to adapt to arbitrarily evolving wildfire episodes in real-time. To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining. Our results indicate marked reductions in detection-to-intervention latency and more effective resource coordination versus traditional systems. By uniting real-time bidirectional DTs with agentic AI, IVSR offers a scalable, semi-automated decision-support paradigm for proactive, adaptive wildfire disaster management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucd94\uac00\ub41c \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud2b8\uc708 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc778 Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud654\uc7ac \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \ub300\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0b0\ubd88\uc758 \ube48\ub3c4\uc640 \uac15\ub3c4\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uba85, \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ubc0f \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc7ac\ud574 \uad00\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uc218\ub3d9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud654\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "IVSR\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ucc98\uc758 \uc13c\uc11c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \uae30\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f 3D \uc232 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec \ud654\uc7ac \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac00\uc0c1 \ubcf5\uc81c\ubcf8\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0 \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c \uc7ac\ud574 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc640 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc544\ub798 \uac1c\uc785 \uc804\uc220\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0b0\ubd88 \uc0ac\uac74 \uac10\uc9c0, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc7ac\uc0dd, \ucda9\ub3cc \uae30\ubc18 \ud654\uc7ac \ud655\uc0b0 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ubcc4 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c IVSR\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub300\ube44 \uac10\uc9c0-\uac1c\uc785 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "IVSR\uc740 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud2b8\uc708\uacfc \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \uc0b0\ubd88 \uc7ac\ud574 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\uc790\ub3d9\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc720\uc5d4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \uc9c0\uad6c \uc628\ub09c\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0b0\ubd88\uc758 \ube48\ub3c4\uc640 \uac15\ub3c4\uac00 2030\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc57d 14%, 2050\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 30% \uc99d\uac00\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0dd\uba85, \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ubc0f \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc7ac\ud574 \uad00\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uc218\ub3d9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud654\uc7ac \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc99d\uac15\ub41c \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud2b8\uc708 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc778 Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Despite recent interest in World Models, most available implementations remain publication-specific, severely limiting their reusability, increasing the risk of bugs, and reducing evaluation standardization. To mitigate these issues, we introduce stable-worldmodel (SWM), a modular, tested, and documented world-model research ecosystem that provides efficient data-collection tools, standardized environments, planning algorithms, and baseline implementations.

The system is built on a structured architecture composed of three coordinated subsystems for generation, verification, and evolution. These subsystems are supported by foundational capabilities for deep research, solution optimization, and long horizon memory. The architecture allows InternAgent-1.5 to operate continuously across extended discovery cycles while maintaining coherent and improving behavior. It also enables the system to coordinate computational modeling and laboratory experimentation within a single unified system. We evaluate InternAgent-1.5 on scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience, and the system achieves leading performance that demonstrates strong foundational capabilities. Beyond these benchmarks, we further assess two categories of discovery tasks. In algorithm discovery tasks, InternAgent-1.5 autonomously designs competitive methods for core machine learning problems. In empirical discovery tasks, it executes complete computational or wet lab experiments and produces scientific findings in earth, life, biological, and physical domains. Overall, these results show that InternAgent-1.5 provides a general and scalable framework for autonomous scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "InternAgent-1.5\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud14c\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud611\uc870\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc704 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(\uc0dd\uc131, \uac80\uc99d, \uc9c4\ud654)\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \uae4a\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "InternAgent-1.5\ub294 GAIA, HLE, GPQA, FrontierScience\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "InternAgent-1.5\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0\uacfc \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d4\ub4dc\ud22c\uc5d4\ub4dc \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 InternAgent-1.5\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131, \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uc9c4\ud654\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ud558\uc704 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc5f0\uad6c, \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 InternAgent-1.5\uac00 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc5f0\uc7a5\ub41c \ubc1c\uacac \uc8fc\uae30 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud14c\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc2e4 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 InternAgent-1.5\ub97c GAIA, HLE, GPQA, FrontierScience\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc94\uc8fc\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ubc1c\uacac \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c InternAgent-1.5\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ub610\ub294 \uc2b5\uc2dd \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uad6c, \uc0dd\uba85, \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc0dd\uc0b0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 InternAgent-1.5\uac00 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774
