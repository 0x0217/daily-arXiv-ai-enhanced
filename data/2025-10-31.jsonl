Traditional agent-based or deep\nlearning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to\ncapture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative\nreasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical\nLLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level\nnarrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral\nexecution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent\nis employed as a \"creative writer\" to produce diary-style narratives rich in\nmotivation and context, then uses another agent as a \"structural parser\" to\nconvert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module\nfurther grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive\nbehavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility\nEntropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility\nacross different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent\nexecutes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time\nintervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding\nthis multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic\ntrajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable\nrepresentations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic\nmobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven\nsimulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and\nsynthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents."}

This technical report bridges this gap by developing a\ncomputational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic\ncoopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer\nsystem with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation\ntracking violation history.

Recently,\ntransformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated\nstrong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.\nHowever, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been\nlimited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.\nExtending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --\nwhich involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due\nto the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different\nattention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.\n  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel\ninformation-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),\nbased on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head\nattention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal\ntransition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We\nprove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a\nsingle-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the\nglobal optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention\nscore patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the\n$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately\nreflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the\nunderlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical\nfindings."}

This paper\npresents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The\nmodel uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully\nparallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for\nwindowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal\nstate-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse\ngenerators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes,\nand audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the\nGift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance,\noutperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast\nmajority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than\nexisting baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.\nWe open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code,\nproviding a reproducible foundation for future research."}

Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;\nhowever, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and\nscalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model\noriginally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface\ntemperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model\nwith high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability\nto capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational\ndemands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating\nlatitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient\nlearning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of\n0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\\approx\n0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces\nchallenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes\nto the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility\nof using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic\napplications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic\nvariables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural\nnetworks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can\nimprove climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting\ndecision-making in environmental and economic sectors."}

Yet when these VLMs\nare adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their\noriginal VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,\nshowing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual\nrepresentations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's\nhidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of\ntargeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart\nVLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We\nfurther evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and\nintroduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields\nimproved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,\nour analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the\ndegradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to\nrecover inherited VL capabilities.

We implement LieSolver and demonstrate\nits application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,\nshowing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency\nand the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems."}
