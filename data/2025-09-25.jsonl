While BSM has been\nsuccessfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state\nrepresentation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP\nscenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has\nattempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis\nof its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In\nthis work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM)\nbetween pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental\nproperties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance\nbound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically\nanalyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in\nMDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived\nfrom the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample\ncomplexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on\nBSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios."}

However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily\nfocus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training\nprocess and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this\npaper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel\nregression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\nLeveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential\nequation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL),\nwhich characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training\nprocess for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured\nthrough an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects\nfully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used\nLRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under\nboth data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical\njustification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such\nas (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii)\nlearning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules\ncan outperform direct-decay schedules.
