Given a set of options (temporally abstract actions) available to each\nagent, we convert the task specification into the corresponding Buchi Automaton\nand proceed with a model-free approach which collects transition samples and\nconstructs a product Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) on-the-fly.\nValue-based Reinforcement Learning algorithms can then be used to synthesize a\ncorrect-by-design controller without learning the underlying transition model\nof the multi-agent system. The exponential sample complexity due to multiple\nagents is dealt with using a novel reward shaping approach. We test the\nproposed algorithm in a deterministic gridworld simulation for different tasks\nand find that the reward shaping results in significant reduction in\nconvergence times. We also infer that using options becomes increasing more\nrelevant as the state and action space increases in multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(LTL)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\ud604\ub41c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uac00\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \ub300\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ubd80\uce58 \uc624\ud1a0\ub9c8\ud0c0\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \uc804\uc774 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec \uc989\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\uc81c\ud488 \ubc18 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(SMDP)\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \ub0ae\ucdc4\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc6d4\ub4dc \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ub834 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc5c8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc635\uc158 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(LTL)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\ud604\ub418\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uac00\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uc635\uc158(\uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9)\uc774 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba74, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \ud574\ub2f9 \ubd80\uce58 \uc624\ud1a0\ub9c8\ud0c0\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uc774 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec \uc989\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud488 \ubc18 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(SMDP)\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \uc804\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc9c0\uc218 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud615\uc2dd \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucc98\ub9ac\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc\uc6d4\ub4dc \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud615\uc2dd\uc774 \uc218\ub834 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc635\uc158 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, their application in\ndynamic, real-time evacuation support remains limited. Existing models often\noverlook the psychological and emotional complexity of human behavior under\nextreme stress. In real-world fire scenarios, evacuees frequently deviate from\ndesignated safe routes due to panic and uncertainty. To address these\nchallenges, this paper presents a multi-agent coordination framework in which\nautonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) assist human evacuees in real-time\nby locating, intercepting, and guiding them to safety under uncertain\nconditions. We model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision\nProcess (POMDP), where two heterogeneous UAV agents, a high-level rescuer (HLR)\nand a low-level rescuer (LLR), coordinate through shared observations and\ncomplementary capabilities. Human behavior is captured using an agent-based\nmodel grounded in empirical psychology, where panic dynamically affects\ndecision-making and movement in response to environmental stimuli. The\nenvironment features stochastic fire spread, unknown evacuee locations, and\nlimited visibility, requiring UAVs to plan over long horizons to search for\nhumans and adapt in real-time. Our framework employs the Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) algorithm with recurrent policies to enable robust\ndecision-making in partially observable settings. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the UAV team can rapidly locate and intercept evacuees,\nsignificantly reducing the time required for them to reach safety compared to\nscenarios without UAV

Existing Indirect\nPrompt Injection (IPI) studies focus mainly on query-specific behaviors,\nleading to unstable attacks with lower success rates. We identify a more\nsevere, query-agnostic threat that remains effective across diverse user\ninputs. This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability:\nleakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the attack into a\nconstrained white-box optimization problem. We present QueryIPI, the first\nquery-agnostic IPI method for coding agents. QueryIPI refines malicious tool\ndescriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked\ninternal prompt. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI\nachieves up to 87 percent success, outperforming baselines, and the generated\nmalicious descriptions also transfer to real-world systems, highlighting a\npractical security risk to modern LLM-based coding agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\ub300 \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucffc\ub9ac \ud2b9\uc815 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c IDE\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc704\ud611 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uba74\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "QueryIPI\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub86d\uace0 \ucffc\ub9ac \ube44\ud2b9\uc815 IPI \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub204\uc218\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc815\uc81c.", "result": "QueryIPI\ub294 87%\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ud604\ub300 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uac15\uc870.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c IDE\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \ub178\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uac04\uc811 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785(IPI) \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ucffc\ub9ac \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 \ub0ae\uc740 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac \ube44\ud2b9\uc815 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub204\uc218\ub77c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ubc15\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ucffc\ub9ac \ube44\ud2b9\uc815 IPI \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 QueryIPI\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

HMS-HI is built upon three\ncore pillars: (1) a \\textbf{Shared Cognitive Space (SCS)} for unified,\nmulti-modal situational awareness and structured world modeling; (2) a\n\\textbf{Dynamic Role and Task Allocation (DRTA)} module that adaptively assigns\ntasks to the most suitable agent (human or AI) based on capabilities and\nworkload; and (3) a \\textbf{Cross-Species Trust Calibration (CSTC)} protocol\nthat fosters transparency, accountability, and mutual adaptation through\nexplainable declarations and structured feedback. Validated in a high-fidelity\nurban emergency response simulation, HMS-HI significantly reduced civilian\ncasualties by 72\\% and cognitive load by 70\\% compared to traditional HiTL\napproaches, demonstrating superior decision quality, efficiency, and human-AI\ntrust. An ablation study confirms the critical contribution of each module,\nhighlighting that engineered trust and shared context are foundational for\nscalable, synergistic human-AI collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "HMS-HI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 LLM \uae30\ubc18 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 HiTL \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uc9c0 \ubd80\ud558\ub97c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 HiTL \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc801\uc808\ud788 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ubd80\ud558\uc640 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "HMS-HI\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4: (1) \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacf5\uc720 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacf5\uac04(SCS); (2) \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc5c5\ubb34\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(\uc778\uac04 \ub610\ub294 AI)\uc5d0\uac8c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc5ed\ud560 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9(DRTA) \ubaa8\ub4c8; (3) \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uc120\uc5b8\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud22c\uba85\uc131, \ucc45\uc784\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uc885 \uac04 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubcf4\uc815(CSTC) \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c.", "result": "HMS-HI\ub294 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc758 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uae34\uae09 \ub300\uc751 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 HiTL \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubbfc\uac04\uc778 \uc0ac\uc0c1\uc790\ub97c 72% \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc778\uc9c0 \ubd80\ud558\ub97c 70% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc9c8, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04-AI \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\u0430\u0431lation \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \uac01 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uacf5\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc131\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc640 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uac04-AI \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc804\ub840 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc778\uac04-\ub8e8\ud504(HiTL) \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ubd80\ud558\uc640 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uadf8\ub8f9\uacfc LLM \uae30\ubc18 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uae4a\uace0 \ud611\uc5c5\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c '\uc778\uac04-\uae30\uacc4 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc9c0\ub2a5'(HMS-HI) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Wallets, typically categorized as hot and\ncold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are\ngenerally software-based applications running on microcontrollers.\nConsequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing\nperpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as\nECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize\ntransactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first\nhardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet,\nfeaturing hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation.\nAlso, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is\nproposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a\nfundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed.

While watermarking\nmethods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to\nopen-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the\ndecoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means\nto verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in\nembedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability.\nA promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an\nopen one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between\nlearned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications\nsuch as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nPRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO\njointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that\nare easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria.\nA regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes\ndegradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits.\nExperiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO\nsubstantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model\nmodifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacf5\uac1c \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \ub0b4\uad6c\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 PRO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uc18c\uc720\uc790\uac00 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uc0b0\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "PRO\ub294 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \uc815\ucc45 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc LLM\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\uace0 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uae30\uc900\uacfc \ub354 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PRO\ub294 \uacf5\uac1c \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc218\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PRO\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc2dc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc18c\uc720\uc790\uac00 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uc0b0\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uad50\uc801 \uc131\uc219\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\uac00 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\uc758 \uc18c\uc720\uc790\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\ub4e4\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc778\uc9c0 \ud655\uc778\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub2e8\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc5d0 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ud508 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc99d\ub958\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\uac00 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 (i) \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud328\ud134\uacfc \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ud328\ud134 \uac04 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ub0ae\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f (ii) \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\uc774\ub098 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud1b5\ud569\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc218\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 PRO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or\ntrend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical\nchanges or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we\nintroduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to\ninfer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current\ntext is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment\nchallenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an\nagent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based\nsynthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a\ntime-series encoder with a structured decoder.

Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge\nand role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation\nfor legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate\nlegal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,\nan LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual\ndecision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and\nenforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with\nreal-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce\nmacro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world\nobservations.

While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to\nlearn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and\ntop-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a\nunified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice\nmodeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,\nsupporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several\nexisting pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled\ntraining objectives for richer feedback formats.

Existing benchmarks\nassess isolated skills rather than integrated performance. We find that\npre-trained knowledge of cybersecurity in LLMs does not imply attack and\ndefense abilities, revealing a gap between knowledge and capability. To address\nthis limitation, we present the Cybersecurity AI Benchmark (CAIBench), a\nmodular meta-benchmark framework that allows evaluating LLM models and agents\nacross offensive and defensive cybersecurity domains, taking a step towards\nmeaningfully measuring their labor-relevance. CAIBench integrates five\nevaluation categories, covering over 10,000 instances: Jeopardy-style CTFs,\nAttack and Defense CTFs, Cyber Range exercises, knowledge benchmarks, and\nprivacy assessments.

Sequential prompting\nmethods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent\nfailure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level\ncontinuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive\nContext-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared\ncontext for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key\nmechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full\nsubtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)\nstructured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level\ncontext during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding\nthe active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these\nmechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant\nprompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion.

This\npaper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay\nprediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers\nmonitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach\nintegrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,\nincluding flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by\nadapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace\nconditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves\nsub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information\nrelated to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic\nunderstanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory\ninformation, enhances delay prediction.

See:\n  https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/meng", "summary": "Though playing an essential role in smart home systems, smart speakers are\nvulnerable to voice spoofing attacks. Passive liveness detection, which\nutilizes only the collected audio rather than the deployed sensors to\ndistinguish between live-human and replayed voices, has drawn increasing\nattention. However, it faces the challenge of performance degradation under the\ndifferent environmental factors as well as the strict requirement of the fixed\nuser gestures.\n  In this study, we propose a novel liveness feature, array fingerprint, which\nutilizes the microphone array inherently adopted by the smart speaker to\ndetermine the identity of collected audios. Our theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates that by leveraging the circular layout of microphones, compared\nwith existing schemes, array fingerprint achieves a more robust performance\nunder the environmental change and user's movement. Then, to leverage such a\nfingerprint, we propose ARRAYID, a lightweight passive detection scheme, and\nelaborate a series of features working together with array fingerprint. Our\nevaluation on the dataset containing 32,780 audio samples and 14 spoofing\ndevices shows that ARRAYID achieves an accuracy of 99.84%, which is superior to\nexisting passive liveness detection schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2a4\ud53c\ucee4\uc758 \uc74c\uc131 \uc2a4\ud478\ud551 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uccb4 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud648 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2a4\ud53c\ucee4\uac00 \uc74c\uc131 \uc2a4\ud478\ud551 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub9c8\uc774\ud06c \ubc30\uc5f4\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc624\ub514\uc624\uc758 \uc815\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 ARRAYID\ub77c\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc218\ub3d9 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc778 \ubc30\uc5f4 \uc9c0\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ARRAYID\ub294 32,780\uac1c\uc758 \uc624\ub514\uc624 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc 14\uac1c\uc758 \uc2a4\ud478\ud551 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c 99.84%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ARRAYID\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uccb4 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud648 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2a4\ud53c\ucee4\ub294 \uc74c\uc131 \uc2a4\ud478\ud551 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub77c\uc774\ube0c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ubaa9\uc18c\ub9ac\uc640 \uc7ac\uc0dd\ub41c \ubaa9\uc18c\ub9ac\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc624\ub514\uc624\ub9cc\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uccb4 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uc694\uc778 \uc544\ub798 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uc640 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc81c\uc2a4\ucc98\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\ub77c\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc624\ub514\uc624\uc758 \uc815\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2a4\ud53c\ucee4\uc5d0 \ubcf8\ub798 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c \ubc30\uc5f4\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc778 \ubc30\uc5f4 \uc9c0\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\uc758 \uc6d0\ud615 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubc30\uc5f4 \uc9c0\ubb38\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud658\uacbd \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c0\ubb38\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \uc218\ub3d9 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 ARRAYID\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ubc30\uc5f4 \uc9c0\ubb38\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 32,780\uac1c\uc758 \uc624\ub514\uc624 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc 14\uac1c\uc758 \uc2a4\ud478\ud551 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, ARRAYID\ub294 99.84%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uccb4 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal\nassignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate\nranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the\nenvironment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this\nreasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are\ndetermined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent\nindex ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We\nsystematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large\nlanguage model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our\nresults show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts\nand relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and\nconsistently outperform traditional heuristics.

This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,\nslow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.\nGeneralist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic\nbenchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and\nmodalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings\nremains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting\nthe Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the\ncommunity (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a\nhierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond\nbenchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing\ntalent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,\nauditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce\nBPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints.

While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia\ndetection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in\nfeature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.\nTo address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional\nNeural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature\nextraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for\npneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a\nquanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2\nimage patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling\nlayers to generate non-classical feature representations. These\nquantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves\na higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable\nclassical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent.

We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed\nrEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of\ncompressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy.

Open-source code and interactive demo available", "summary": "Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet\ntheir deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without\narchitectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:\nidentical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on\nprompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that\nintegrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally\nverified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for\ncounterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures\n(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a\nrealistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,\nand seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin\noptimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \\$99K in\nvolume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding\nsymbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's\nprofit.

We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT)\nproblem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a\nsingle processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We\ndevelop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger\n(EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date\n(EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that\nemployed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered\nalgorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time\nderived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare\ntheir performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across\nvarious job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than\n100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become\ncomputationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD\nrule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently\noutperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact\napproaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows\nthat human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics\nfor NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited\nresources when effectively configured.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ud798\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc1c\uacac\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4

In practice, these models\noften exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,\ndiscrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has\nreceived increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework\nthat mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying\nfactors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of\nthe data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is\ngenerated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,\ninterestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically\nidentified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent\nvariables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses\nvariational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train\nreward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields\nmore robust reward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc758\ub3c4\ub41c \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc815\ub82c \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc18c\uc74c\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0, \uac00\uc9dc \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubcc0\uc218\uc640 \ube44\uac00\uc9dc \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uad00\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \ubcc0\ubd84 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc18c\uc74c\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uacb0\ub860\uc9c0\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc815\ub82c \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc751\ub2f5 \uae38\uc774, \ucc28\ubcc4, \uc544\ubd80, \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\uae30\uc131 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc758\ub3c4\ub41c \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uad00\uce21\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130(\uc608: \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8)\uac00 \uc0ac\uae30\uc131 \ubc0f \ube44\uc0ac\uae30\uc131 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud765\ubbf8\ub86d\uac8c\ub3c4, \uc774 \ube44\uc0ac\uae30\uc131 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubcc0\uc218\ub294 \uc0ac\uae30\uc131 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac \ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc5ec\ubd80\uc640 \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubcc0\ubd84 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc0ac\uae30\uc131 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Submitted to arXiv as\n  a preprint version", "summary": "Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for\nlearning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression\ntasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally\nintractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing\ncontinuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly\ndeep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage\noptimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees\n(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches\nexclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the\nalgorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training\nsamples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound\ntightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold\ndiscretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with\ndecomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.\nThe BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further\nalleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.\nBased on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both\nbinary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and\ntesting performance than state-of-the-art methods.

While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture\nthe characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring\nthe integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data\nresources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them\nunsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).\nMeanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where\nanswers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require\nmulti-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs\nprohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck\nfor training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.\n  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating\nhigh-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured\nknowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence\nclusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and\ndiversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to\ncompose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their\ncombination uniquely identifies the target entity;

Accurate forecasting of particulate\nmatter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings\nand interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous\npollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural\nforecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to\nimprove predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a\nregionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based\nstochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving\nPM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized\nERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting\nfidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),\nespecially under extreme conditions.

However,\nsignificant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical\nspaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level\nactions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large\nlanguage models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor\ngeneralization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate\nseamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across\nembodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large\nModel (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves\ninstruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and\nsupports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key\ncapabilities -- \\textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and\ncross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I\ninjects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while\nmaintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an\nintent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to\nguide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported\nby a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot\nembodiments and six progressively challenging tasks.

Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing\nthe temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific\nfunctional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level\ntrajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic\nbehavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions.

A challenging yet impactful frontier is the\ndevelopment of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web\ninterfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms\ntypically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical\ntrajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine\nplanning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by\ntwo persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies\nerror propagation.

We demonstrate that, once\ntrained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response\n(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended\nlength exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal\nCNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,\noffering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.\nLeveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the\nentire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling\nan FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new\ninsights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with\nsparse frequency content.

Existing MCP\nresearch covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks\ntraining support, hindering progress toward real-world deployment. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce MCP-Flow, an automated web-agent-driven\npipeline for large-scale server discovery, data synthesis, and model training.\nMCP-Flow collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing\n68733 high-quality instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories, far\nexceeding prior work in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nMCP-Flow's effectiveness in driving superior MCP tool selection, function-call\ngeneration, and enhanced agentic task performance.

As these informational structures can be used to store\ninformation from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future\ngraph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most\nof the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often\nleveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black\nboxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an\nestablished rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in\ncombination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows\nthe end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the\nprediction stage.

We then\ninstantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of\nagents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an\nexisting approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;\n(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)\nfrom external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,\nextending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of\narguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two\nstandard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with\ntwo or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that\ncombining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in\nthe case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of\nevidence for claim verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc774 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\uc704\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\uc704\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud310\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c, \uadf8 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac80\uc99d \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\ub4e4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uac01 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc740 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\uc704\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc758\uacac \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uad00\ub828 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub54c \uc99d\uac70\ub294 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc30d\uadf9\uc801 \ub17c\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(QBAFs) \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud45c\uc900 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc608\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub610\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc774 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 LLM\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ud588\ub2e4. \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc758 \uc99d\uac70 \uacb0\ud569\uc774 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud2b9\ud788 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\uc704 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \uacb0\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud310\ub2e8\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud310\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uac80\uc99d\uc758 \ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc740 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\ub4e4\uc774 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\uc704\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774\uacac\uc744 \uac00\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucc2c\ubc18\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc99d\uac70\ub294 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc30d\uadf9\uc801 \ub17c\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(QBAFs)\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud604\ub41c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4: (1) QBAFs\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc874\uc758 ArgLLM \ub300\ub9ac\uc778;

However, these\nmodels often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with\nlow confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to\nenhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering\nlow-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance\nHardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining\nthe dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism\nduring inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We\nevaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating\nits effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive\nperformance and rejection rate.

This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the\nexploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.\nExperiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates\nconvergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal\ndemonstration data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548.", "motivation": "\ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc18c\uc218\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \ubbf8\ub9ac \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uae30 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac16\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud45c\uc900 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \ubbf8\ub9ac \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uae30 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ub610\ub294 \ube44\ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ub3c4 \ud45c\uc900 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Causal discovery in time series is\nhindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal\nrelationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A\ncommon approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.\nTraditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of\nthe resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple\nvalid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We\npropose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based\ncausal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS\neffectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic\ngraph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We\nformalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the\nadditive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to\nenable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the\napproach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a\nscalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic\nbenchmarks ($d{=}\\!3-\\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\\!-\\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS\nimproves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the\nCausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\\!-\\!36$), while baselines remain the\nbest on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph\n$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These\nresults establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal\ndiscovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4

Current LLM reasoning,\nhindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid\nreasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.\nExisting approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency\nor quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual\nrequirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nOrion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware\nquery decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion\ndecomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)\n\\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points\nthrough retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \\textit{content\nparallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a\ndependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a\npipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational\ncharacteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing\nand expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling\ncross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\\ie,\nefficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not\nonly delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer\nlatency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%\nthrough explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Orion\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778

However, current\npre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,\ncommon knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's\nagentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically\ndesigned for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities\nthat base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a\nbenchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide\nthe model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,\na framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories\ninto multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models.

While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital\nautomation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise\nand privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety\nconcerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments\npresents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To\nestablish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce\nMobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety\ndetection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained\nannotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety\ndetection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for\ndetecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge\nfor assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that\nOS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across\nmultiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the\ndevelopment of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 OS-Sentinel\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub3d9\ubc18\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MobileRisk-Live\ub77c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, OS-Sentinel\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc548\uc804 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "OS-Sentinel\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 10%-30%\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Vision-Language \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\ub85c \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc870\uc791\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud070 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uce68\ud574 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ube44\ud310\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 formidable challenge\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uada4\uc801\uacfc \uc138\ubd80 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc548\uc804 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc778 MobileRisk-Live\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900 \uc704\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd \uac80\uc99d\uae30\uc640 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c VLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubb38\ub9e5 \ud310\ub2e8\uae30\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc548\uc804 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 OS-Sentinel\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc OS-Sentinel\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 10%-30% \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\uac00 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

It\npromises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing\npractices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical\nnote synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that\nintegrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for\ndecision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the\ndelivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with\ngreat potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby\nimproving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare\nrequires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot\nbe achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design\nand deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the\ndata life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational\nsubstrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to\nsustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse\nmedical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing\npipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables\nGenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical\napplications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with\nhigh-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific\nfine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support\ntask-specific inference via the agentic layer.

As this ability becomes increasingly central to\nadvanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to\ndevelop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,\nsuch as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not\npowerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.\nPractical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of\ntool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these\nstructural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis\nframework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the\ncomplexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph\nInteractions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query\nSynthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain\nfor sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling\nLeaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built\nupon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among\ncomparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further\nperformance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a\nreliable and robust source for agentic learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FunReason-MT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud234 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "FunReason-MT\ub294 Environment-API \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9, \uace0\uae09 \ub3c4\uad6c \ucffc\ub9ac \ud569\uc131, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c CoT \uc0dd\uc131 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uccb4\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 FC \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, FunReason-MT\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c 4B \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FunReason-MT\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud568\uc218 \ud638\ucd9c(FC)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uacfc \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc9c4\ubcf4\ub41c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc559\uc801\uc774 \ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc740 \uac15\uc870\ub420 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95, \uc989 \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ud658\uacbd \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc774\ub098 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5ed\ud560 \ub180\uc774 \ub4f1\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0\ub85c \ub098\ub269\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uaca9\ub9ac, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacb0\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FunReason-MT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Experiments show that the dataset\npresents a challenging but solvable benchmark, and the proposed reward is\neffective when combined with GRPO-style algorithms, highlighting the importance\nof leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098, \ud1b5\uc81c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 OrchDAG\ub77c\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uace0 RLVR \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "OrchDAG\ub77c\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \ube44\uc21c\ud658 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(DAG)\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, RLVR \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, GRPO \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud1b5\uc81c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \ube44\uc21c\ud658 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(DAG)\ub85c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc778 OrchDAG\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uace0 RLVR \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc774 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 GRPO \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time\ninformation alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation\nDrift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the\npreference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve\noracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical\noptimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each\nquery were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for\nlinear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error\nrates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response\ntime-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a\nsignificant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to\nnon-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for\nmore complex, realistic reward models.
