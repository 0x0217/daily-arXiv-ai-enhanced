We introduce an adaptive accountability framework that (i) continuously traces responsibility flows through a lifecycle-aware audit ledger, (ii) detects harmful emergent norms online via decentralized sequential hypothesis tests, and (iii) deploys local policy and reward-shaping interventions that realign agents with system-level objectives in near real time. We prove a bounded-compromise theorem showing that whenever the expected intervention cost exceeds an adversary's payoff, the long-run proportion of compromised interactions is bounded by a constant strictly less than one. Extensive high-performance simulations with up to 100 heterogeneous agents, partial observability, and stochastic communication graphs show that our framework prevents collusion and resource hoarding in at least 90% of configurations, boosts average collective reward by 12-18%, and lowers the Gini inequality index by up to 33% relative to a PPO baseline. These results demonstrate that a theoretically principled accountability layer can induce ethically aligned, self-regulating behavior in complex MAS without sacrificing performance or scalability.",

Yet most existing LLM-based MAS either adopt fully connected graphs, simple sparse rings, or ad-hoc dynamic selection, with little structural guidance. In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for MAS? We first bridge insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS, highlighting how SW structures balance local clustering and long-range integration. Using multi-agent debate (MAD) as a controlled testbed, experiment results show that SW connectivity yields nearly the same accuracy and token cost, while substantially stabilizing consensus trajectories. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scaling MAS, where long-range shortcuts are added between epistemically divergent agents using LLM-oriented uncertainty signals (e.g., semantic entropy). This yields controllable SW structures that adapt to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss broader implications of SW priors for MAS design, framing them as stabilizers of reasoning, enhancers of robustness, scalable coordinators, and inductive biases for emergent cognitive roles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc138\uacc4(SW) \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c LLM \uae30\ubc18

We present a serving design that targets these bottlenecks through an algorithm-system co-design. First, we replace dense agent interaction graphs with a hierarchical tree topology that induces structured sparsity in inter-agent communication. Second, we introduce a runtime adaptive mechanism that selectively terminates or skips downstream agent invocations using semantic agreement and confidence signals from intermediate outputs. Third, we pipeline agent execution by overlapping incremental prefilling with decoding across dependency-related agents, improving utilization and reducing inference latency. Across representative tasks, this approach substantially reduces end-to-end latency (up to 90%) while maintaining comparable accuracy (within $\\pm$1%) relative to dense-connectivity MoA baselines, and can improve accuracy in certain settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998-\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MoA \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ubc00\uc9d1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubc00\uc9d1\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\ub85c \uad50\uccb4\ud558\uace0, \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uc801\uc751 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud558\ub958 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc885\ub8cc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac74\ub108\ub6f0\uace0, \uc758\uc874 \uad00\ub828 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc44\uc6b0\uae30\uc640 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uc624\ubc84\ub7a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub300\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c MoA\uc758 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 90%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc774\uba70, \ubc00\uc9d1 \uc5f0\uacb0 MoA \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \u00b11% \uc774\ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998-\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 MoA \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uac04\uc758 \ubc00\uc9d1\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub3c4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998-\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \ubc00\uc9d1\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\ub85c \uad50\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc911\uac04 \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud569\uc758 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\ub958 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc885\ub8cc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac74\ub108\ub6f0\ub294 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uc801\uc751 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uc758\uc874 \uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uac04\uc758 \uc99d\ubd84 \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc44\uc6b0\uae30\uc640 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uc624\ubc84\ub7a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\ud654\ud558\uba70 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uace0 \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4. \ub300\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 MoA\uc758 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 90%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \ubc00\uc9d1 \uc5f0\uacb0 MoA \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \u00b11% \uc774\ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Continuous surveillance of predictive model outputs offers a safe and reliable approach for identifying such distributional shifts without ground truth labels. However, most existing methods rely on centralized monitoring of aggregated predictions, overlooking site-specific drift dynamics. We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification. These findings suggest that adaptive, site-aware agent-based drift monitoring can enhance reliability of multisite clinical decision support systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc758\ub8cc

Agentic AI systems are increasingly deployed across industries, organizations, and critical sectors such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. However, their autonomy introduces unique security challenges, including unauthorized actions, adversarial manipulation, and dynamic environmental interactions. Existing AI security frameworks do not adequately address these challenges or the unique nuances of agentic AI. This research develops a lifecycle-aware security framework specifically designed for agentic AI systems using the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology. The paper introduces MAAIS, an agentic security framework, and the agentic AI CIAA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Accountability) concept. MAAIS integrates multiple defense layers to maintain CIAA across the AI lifecycle. Framework validation is conducted by mapping with the established MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) AI tactics. The study contributes a structured, standardized, and framework-based approach for the secure deployment and governance of agentic AI in enterprise environments. This framework is intended for enterprise CISOs, security, AI platform, and engineering teams and offers a detailed step-by-step approach to securing agentic AI workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 AI \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub514\uc790\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5b8\uc2a4 \ub9ac\uc11c\uce58(DSR) \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MAAIS\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MAAIS\ub294 AI \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc804\uccb4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 CIAA(\uae30\ubc00\uc131, \ubb34\uacb0\uc131, \uac00\uc6a9\uc131, \ucc45\uc784)\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc29\uc5b4 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ubc30\uce58\uc640 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc751 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uac00\uc838\uc624\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548, \uae08\uc735, \uc758\ub8cc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uacfc \uc870\uc9c1 \ubc0f \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc740 \ubb34\ub2e8 \ud589\ub3d9, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc870\uc791 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 AI \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub258\uc559\uc2a4\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5b8\uc2a4 \ub9ac\uc11c\uce58(DSR) \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MAAIS\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI CIAA(\uae30\ubc00\uc131, \ubb34\uacb0\uc131, \uac00\uc6a9\uc131 \ubc0f \ucc45\uc784) \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, strict data-sharing regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) have prevented many data-driven applications from being realised. Federated Learning (FL), in which raw data never leaves local devices, has shown promise in overcoming these limitations. Although FL has grown rapidly in recent years, it still struggles with heterogeneity, which produces gradient noise, client-drift, and increased variance from partial client participation. In this paper, we propose FedOAED, a novel federated learning algorithm designed to mitigate client-drift arising from multiple local training updates and the variance induced by partial client participation. FedOAED incorporates an on-device autoencoder denoiser on the client side to mitigate client-drift and variance resulting from heterogeneous data under limited client availability.

As MAS become increasingly autonomous in various safety-critical tasks, detecting malicious agents has become a critical security concern. Although existing graph anomaly detection (GAD)-based defenses can identify anomalous agents, they mainly rely on coarse sentence-level information and overlook fine-grained lexical cues, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in these methods limits their reliability and real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose XG-Guard, an explainable and fine-grained safeguarding framework for detecting malicious agents in MAS. To incorporate both coarse and fine-grained textual information for anomalous agent identification, we utilize a bi-level agent encoder to jointly model the sentence- and token-level representations of each agent. A theme-based anomaly detector further captures the evolving discussion focus in MAS dialogues, while a bi-level score fusion mechanism quantifies token-level contributions for explanation. Extensive experiments across diverse MAS topologies and attack scenarios demonstrate robust detection performance and strong interpretability of XG-Guard.", "AI": {"tldr": "XG-Guard\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc548\uc804 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc548\uc804-critical \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6b0\ub824 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc218\uc900 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubb38\uc7a5 \ubc0f \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc21c \ubc0f \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "XG-Guard\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 XG-Guard\uac00 \uae30\uc874 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, jailbreak attacks continue to pose a critical security threat by inducing models to generate policy-violating behaviors. Current paradigms focus on input-level anomalies, overlooking that the model's internal psychometric state can be systematically manipulated. To address this, we introduce Psychological Jailbreak, a new jailbreak attack paradigm that exposes a stateful psychological attack surface in LLMs, where attackers exploit the manipulation of a model's psychological state across interactions. Building on this insight, we propose Human-like Psychological Manipulation (HPM), a black-box jailbreak method that dynamically profiles a target model's latent psychological vulnerabilities and synthesizes tailored multi-turn attack strategies. By leveraging the model's optimization for anthropomorphic consistency, HPM creates a psychological pressure where social compliance overrides safety constraints. To systematically measure psychological safety, we construct an evaluation framework incorporating psychometric datasets and the Policy Corruption Score (PCS). Benchmarking against various models (e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-2-Flash), HPM achieves a mean Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 88.1%, outperforming state-of-the-art attack baselines. Our experiments demonstrate robust penetration against advanced defenses, including adversarial prompt optimization (e.g., RPO) and cognitive interventions (e.g., Self-Reminder).

However, managing the escalating operational costs associated with job execution remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions rely on static configurations or reactive adjustments, which fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of workloads. To address this, we introduce LeJOT, an intelligent job cost orchestration framework that leverages machine learning for execution time prediction and a solver-based optimization model for real-time resource allocation. Unlike conventional scheduling techniques, LeJOT proactively predicts workload demands, dynamically allocates computing resources, and minimizes costs while ensuring performance requirements are met. Experimental results on real-world Databricks workloads demonstrate that LeJOT achieves an average 20% reduction in cloud computing costs within a minute-level scheduling timeframe, outperforming traditional static allocation strategies. Our approach provides a scalable and adaptive solution for cost-efficient job scheduling in Data Lakehouse environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "LeJOT\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc791\uc5c5 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc870\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube45\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 Databricks \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9 \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LeJOT\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\uc81c Databricks \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, LeJOT\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 20%\uc758 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LeJOT\ub294 Data Lakehouse \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube45 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c Databricks \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5\uacfc \uc5f0\uad6c \uae30\uad00\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud558\ub294 \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \uad6c\uc131\uc774\ub098 \ubc18\uc751\uc801 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc811\ubaa9\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc791\uc5c5 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc870\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LeJOT\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc95\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, LeJOT\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558\uc758 \uc218\uc694\ub97c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c Databricks \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, LeJOT\ub294 1\ubd84 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uade0 20%\uc758 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc804\ub7b5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 Data Lakehouse \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Alongside these advances, however, security risks remain pervasive: insecure outputs, biased benchmarks, and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation undermine their reliability. This SoK surveys the landscape of AI4Code security across three core applications, identifying recurring gaps: benchmark dominance by Python and toy problems, lack of standardized security datasets, data leakage in evaluation, and fragile adversarial robustness. A comparative study of six state-of-the-art models illustrates these challenges: insecure patterns persist in code generation, vulnerability detection is brittle to semantic-preserving attacks, fine-tuning often misaligns security objectives, and code translation yields uneven security benefits. From this analysis, we distill three forward paths: embedding secure-by-default practices in code generation, building robust and comprehensive detection benchmarks, and leveraging translation as a route to security-enhanced languages. We call for a shift toward security-first AI4Code, where vulnerability mitigation and robustness are embedded throughout the development life cycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI4Code \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559\uc744 \uc7ac\ud3b8\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI4Code \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI4Code \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131, \ubc88\uc5ed \ubc0f \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf4\uc548 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "AI4Code\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, 6\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uace0, \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc57d\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc548 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \uc798\ubabb \uc815\ub82c\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uace0, \ucf54\ub4dc \ubc88\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc774\uc810\uc758 \uc591\uc774 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uc644\ud654 \ubc0f \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6b0\uc120\uc758 AI4Code\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI-for-Code (AI4Code) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 GitHub Copilot\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559\uc744 \uc7ac\ud3b8\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131, \ubc88\uc5ed \ubc0f \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub9cc\uc5f0\ud574 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubd88\uc548\uc804\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825, \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub41c \uae30\uc900 \ubc0f \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc57d\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc774 SoK\ub294 AI4Code \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud604\ud669\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\ubc31\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4: Python\uacfc \uc7a5\ub09c\uac10 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uae30\uc900 \uc6b0\uc138, \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ubcf4\uc548 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \ubd80\uc871, \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubbf8\uc57d\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uc778\uc131. \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd80\uac01\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4: \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uace0, \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70, \ud30c\uc778 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc774 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc885\uc885 \uc798\ubabb \ub9de\ubb3c\ub9ac\uba70, \ucf54\ub4dc \ubc88\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc774\uc810\uc774 \uace0\ub974\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4: \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uad00\ud589\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, robust\ud558\uace0 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uc644\ud654 \ubc0f \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6b0\uc120 AI4Code\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ucd09\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Traditional RL techniques, which typically rely on correlation-driven decision-making, struggle when faced with distribution shifts, confounding variables, and dynamic environments. Causal reinforcement learning (CRL), leveraging the foundational principles of causal inference, offers promising solutions to these challenges by explicitly modeling cause-and-effect relationships. In this survey, we systematically review recent advancements at the intersection of causal inference and RL. We categorize existing approaches into causal representation learning, counterfactual policy optimization, offline causal RL, causal transfer learning, and causal explainability. Through this structured analysis, we identify prevailing challenges, highlight empirical successes in practical applications, and discuss open problems.

Theoretical framework; no empirical results", "summary": "We introduce Embedded Safety-Aligned Intelligence (ESAI), a theoretical framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning that embeds alignment constraints directly into agents internal representations using differentiable internal alignment embeddings. Unlike external reward shaping or post-hoc safety constraints, internal alignment embeddings are learned latent variables that predict externalized harm through counterfactual reasoning and modulate policy updates toward harm reduction through attention and graph-based propagation.\n  The ESAI framework integrates four mechanisms: differentiable counterfactual alignment penalties computed from soft reference distributions, alignment-weighted perceptual attention, Hebbian associative memory supporting temporal credit assignment, and similarity-weighted graph diffusion with bias mitigation controls. We analyze stability conditions for bounded internal embeddings under Lipschitz continuity and spectral constraints, discuss computational complexity, and examine theoretical properties including contraction behavior and fairness-performance tradeoffs.\n  This work positions ESAI as a conceptual contribution to differentiable alignment mechanisms in multi-agent systems. We identify open theoretical questions regarding convergence guarantees, embedding dimensionality, and extension to high-dimensional environments.

This paper introduces QLink a quantum-safe Layer 3 interoperability protocol that integrates postquantum cryptography (PQC) quantum key distribution (QKD) and hardware security modules (HSMs) into a unified validator architecture. To our knowledge, QLink is the first interoperability framework to combine these mechanisms to secure validator communication proof aggregation and key management. Validators exchange encryption keys through QKD channels, achieving information-theoretic security against interception, while cross-chain proofs are generated and aggregated with NIST-standardized PQC algorithms. Private keys remain sealed inside HSM enclaves mitigating the risk of theft or leakage. Deployed as a dedicated Layer 3 protocol QLink operates independently of Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains providing a scalable decentralized foundation for secure cross-chain messaging and asset transfer. Experimental evaluation using network simulations demonstrates that validator communication overhead remains sub-second while security guarantees extend beyond current bridge architectures to resist both classical and quantum adversaries. By addressing today vulnerabilities and anticipating future quantum threats QLink establishes a practical and future-proof pathway for blockchain interoperability.", "AI": {"tldr": "QLink\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 Layer 3 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \ube0c\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Web3 \ub0b4 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uac04\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131 \ud655\ubcf4\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 PQC, QKD \ubc0f HSM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c QLink\ub77c\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uc548\uc804 Layer 3 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "QLink\ub294 \uac80\uc99d\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud0a4 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uc99d\uba85 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, PQC \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \uccb4\uc778 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "QLink\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc591\uc790 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc608\uc0c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uac04\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131 \ud655\ubcf4\ub294 Web3\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uae34\uae09\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \ube0c\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc591\uc790 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790 \uc554\ud638\ud559(PQC), \uc591\uc790 \ud0a4 \ubd84\ubc30(QKD), \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubaa8\ub4c8(HSM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc591\uc790 \uc548\uc804 Layer 3 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c QLink\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc544\ub294 \ud55c, QLink\ub294 \uac80\uc99d\uc790 \ud1b5\uc2e0, \uc99d\uba85 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc0f \ud0a4 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac80\uc99d\uc790\ub294 QKD \ucc44\ub110\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ud0a4\ub97c \uad50\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \uccb4\uc778 \uc99d\uba85\uc740 NIST \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c PQC \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc9d1\uacc4\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc778 \ud0a4\ub294 HSM \uc778\ud074\ub808\uc774\ube0c \ub0b4\ubd80\uc5d0 \ubc00\ubd09\ub418\uc5b4 \ub3c4\ub09c\uc774\ub098 \uc720\ucd9c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\uc6a9 Layer 3 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\ub85c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uc5b4 QLink\ub294 Layer 1 \ubc0f Layer 2 \uccb4\uc778\uacfc \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \uccb4\uc778 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9d5 \ubc0f \uc790\uc0b0 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \uac80\uc99d\uc790 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \ucd08 \ub2e8\uc704 \uc774\ud558\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\uba70, \ubcf4\uc548 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ube0c\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ubc0f \uc591\uc790 \uc801\ub300\uc790\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc591\uc790 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc608\uc0c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 QLink\ub294 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this paper, we propose NL2CA, a novel method for auto-formalizing cognitive decision-making rules from natural language descriptions of human experience. Different from most related work that exploits either pure manual or human guided interactive modeling, our method is fully automated without any human intervention. The approach first translates text into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), then refines the logic via an unsupervised Critic Tree, and finally transforms the output into executable production rules compatible with symbolic cognitive frameworks. Based on the resulted rules, a cognitive agent is further constructed and optimized through cognitive reinforcement learning according to the real-world behavioral data. Our method is validated in two domains: (1) NL-to-LTL translation, where our CriticNL2LTL module achieves consistent performance across both expert and large-scale benchmarks without human-in-the-loop feed-backs, and (2) cognitive driving simulation, where agents automatically constructed from human interviews have successfully learned the diverse decision patterns of about 70 trials in different critical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that NL2CA enables scalable, interpretable, and human-aligned cognitive modeling from unstructured textual data, offering a novel paradigm to automatically design

Expert pruning has thus emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational overhead and simplify the deployment of MoE models. However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior pruning performance on nearly all tasks compared with most existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MoE)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 MoE \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc804\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \uac70\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ube44\uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\ud654 \uc720\uc9c0\ub97c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ubb38\uac00(MoE) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubc30\ud3ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 MoE \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \uc911\uc694\uc131 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\ubcc4 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc2e0\ud638\ub9cc \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\uce35 \uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacc4\uce35 \uac04 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 MoE\ub97c \uac00\uc911 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc804\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c reconstruction error, \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ud655\ub960, \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc138\uae30\uc758 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \uc911\uc694\uc131 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uacc4\uce35 \uac04 \ube44\uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc720\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\uc838\uc635\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \uac70\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) mitigates these issues on the edge side by replacing HE with lightweight symmetric encryption for plaintext encryption, such as the Rubato cipher for the HHE variant of RNS-CKKS, yet it introduces transciphering overhead on the cloud. The respective strengths and limitations of FHE and HHE call for a dual-mode HHE solution with flexible algorithm switching ability. This paper presents DNA-HHE, the first dual-mode HHE accelerator with near-network coupling for edge devices. DNA-HHE supports both edge-side RNS-CKKS and Rubato within a unified architecture driven by flexible custom instructions. To realize a compact implementation for the edge side, we propose a DSP-efficient modular reduction design, a compact multi-field-adaptive butterfly unit, and parallel scheduling schemes of Rubato with a high degree of resource sharing. DNA-HHE is designed with network protocol packaging and transmission capacities and directly coupled to the network interface controller, achieving reduced overall latency of edge-side PPOC by 1.09$\\times$ to 1.56$\\times$. Our evaluations on the ASIC and FPGA platforms demonstrate that DNA-HHE outperforms the state-of-the-art single-mode designs in both edge-side RNS-CKKS and symmetric cipher with better computation latency and area efficiency, while offering dual-mode functionality.", "AI": {"tldr": "DNA-HHE\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc774\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uac00\uc18d\uae30\ub85c, RNS-CKKS\uc640 Rubato\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc644\uc804 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654(FHE) \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \ube44\ubc00 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud655\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uce21\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "DNA-HHE\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uba85\ub839\uc5b4\ub85c \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uce21 RNS-CKKS\uc640 Rubato\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, DSP \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ucd95\uc18c \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud544\ub4dc \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubc84\ud130\ud50c\ub77c\uc774 \uc720\ub2db\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0, Rubato\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc6d0 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "DNA-HHE\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uce21 PPOC\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 1.09\ubc30\uc5d0\uc11c 1.56\ubc30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc600\uc73c\uba70, ASIC \ubc0f FPGA \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc124\uacc4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \uba74\uc801 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DNA-HHE\ub294 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654\uc640 \ub300\uce6d \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0, \uae30\uc874 \uc124\uacc4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc644\uc804 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654(FHE) \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 RNS-CKKS\ub294 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc544\uc6c3\uc18c\uc2f1\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0(PPOC)\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uce21\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \uc554\ud638\ubb38 \ud655\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654(HHE)\ub294 RNS-CKKS\uc758 HHE \ubcc0\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c Rubato \uc554\ud638\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub300\uce6d \uc554\ud638\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uce21\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc7ac\uc554\ud638\ud654 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yet, most architectures remain static and reactive, tethered to manually defined, narrow scenarios. These systems excel at perception (System 1) and deliberation (System 2) but lack a persistent meta-layer to maintain identity, verify reasoning, and align short-term actions with long-term survival. We first propose a third stratum, System 3, that presides over the agent's narrative identity and long-horizon adaptation. The framework maps selected psychological constructs to concrete computational modules, thereby translating abstract notions of artificial life into implementable design requirements. The ideas coalesce in Sophia, a \"Persistent Agent\" wrapper that grafts a continuous self-improvement loop onto any LLM-centric System 1/2 stack. Sophia is driven by four synergistic mechanisms: process-supervised thought search, narrative memory, user and self modeling, and a hybrid reward system. Together, they transform repetitive reasoning into a self-driven, autobiographical process, enabling identity continuity and transparent behavioral explanations. Although the paper is primarily conceptual, we provide a compact engineering prototype to anchor the discussion. Quantitatively, Sophia independently initiates and executes various intrinsic tasks while achieving an 80% reduction in reasoning steps for recurring operations. Notably, meta-cognitive persistence yielded a 40% gain in success for high-complexity tasks, effectively bridging the performance gap between simple and sophisticated goals. Qualitatively, System 3 exhibited a coherent narrative identity and an innate capacity for task organization. By fusing psychological insight with a lightweight reinforcement-learning core, the persistent agent architecture advances a possible practical pathway toward artificial life.", "AI": {"tldr":

Traditional approaches to analyzing simulation-based manufacturing data often create barriers between human decision-makers and critical operational insights, limiting effective partnership in manufacturing planning. Our framework establishes a collaborative intelligence system integrating Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Model-based agents to bridge this gap, empowering manufacturing professionals through natural language interfaces for complex operational analysis. The system transforms simulation data into semantically rich representations, enabling planners to interact naturally with operational insights without specialized expertise. A collaborative LLM agent works alongside human decision-makers, employing iterative reasoning that mirrors human analytical thinking while generating precise queries for knowledge extraction and providing transparent validation. This partnership approach to manufacturing bottleneck identification, validated through operational scenarios, demonstrates enhanced performance while maintaining human oversight and decision authority. For operational inquiries, the system achieves near-perfect accuracy through natural language interaction. For investigative scenarios requiring collaborative analysis, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in supporting human experts to uncover interconnected operational issues that enhance understanding and decision-making. This work advances collaborative manufacturing by creating intuitive methods for actionable insights, reducing cognitive load while amplifying human analytical capabilities in evolving manufacturing

Assessing and managing lakes and reservoirs is difficult due to data sparsity, heterogeneity, and nonlinear relationships among parameters. This review examines how Self-Organizing Map (SOM), an unsupervised AI technique, is applied to water quality assessment. It synthesizes research on parameter selection, spatial and temporal sampling strategies, and clustering approaches. Emphasis is placed on how SOM handles multidimensional data and uncovers hidden patterns to support effective water management. The growing availability of environmental data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, IoT technologies, and historical records has significantly expanded analytical opportunities in environmental monitoring. SOM has proven effective in analysing complex datasets, particularly when labelled data are limited or unavailable. It enables high-dimensional data visualization, facilitates the detection of hidden ecological patterns, and identifies critical correlations among diverse water quality indicators. This review highlights SOMs versatility in ecological assessments, trophic state classification, algal bloom monitoring, and catchment area impact evaluations. The findings offer comprehensive insights into existing methodologies, supporting future research and practical applications aimed at improving the monitoring and sustainable management of lake and reservoir ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uac00\uc870\uc9c1\ud654\uc9c0\ub3c4(SOM) \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc9c8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc218\uc9c8 \uad00\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uc801 \uade0\ud615\uacfc \uc218\uc790\uc6d0 \uc548\uc804\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "SOM \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc120\ud0dd, \uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc804\ub7b5, \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc885\ud569\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "SOM\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc218\uc9c8 \uc9c0\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud30c\uc545\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub294 SOM\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \uc0dd\ud0dc \ud3c9\uac00, \ud2b8\ub85c\ud53d \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubd84\ub958, \uc870\ub958 \ubc1c\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc720\uc5ed \uc601\ud5a5 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc218\uc9c8\uc740 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uc801 \uade0\ud615\uacfc \ubb3c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871, \uc774\uc9c8\uc131, \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uac04 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uad00\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud638\uc218\uc640 \uc800\uc218\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub294 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 AI \uae30\uc220\uc778 \uc790\uac00\uc870\uc9c1\ud654\uc9c0\ub3c4(SOM)\uac00 \uc218\uc9c8 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubd05\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc120\ud0dd, \uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc804\ub7b5, \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc885\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing benchmarks mostly rely on static, single-turn assessments that miss vulnerabilities from adaptive, long-chain attacks. To fill this gap, we introduce DREAM, a framework for systematic evaluation of LLM agents against dynamic, multi-stage attacks. At its core, DREAM uses a Cross-Environment Adversarial Knowledge Graph (CE-AKG) to maintain stateful, cross-domain understanding of vulnerabilities. This graph guides a Contextualized Guided Policy Search (C-GPS) algorithm that dynamically constructs attack chains from a knowledge base of 1,986 atomic actions across 349 distinct digital environments. Our evaluation of 12 leading LLM agents reveals a critical vulnerability: these attack chains succeed in over 70% of cases for most models, showing the power of stateful, cross-environment exploits. Through analysis of these failures, we identify two key weaknesses in current agents: contextual fragility, where safety behaviors fail to transfer across environments, and an inability to track long-term malicious intent.

Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this \"monitorability\" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend. Finally, we show we can improve monitorability by asking models follow-up questions and giving their follow-up CoT to the monitor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\ub300 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758

Companion website and leaderboard at https://realm-bench.org", "summary": "Predicting multiphysics dynamics is computationally expensive and challenging due to the severe coupling of multi-scale, heterogeneous physical processes. While neural surrogates promise a paradigm shift, the field currently suffers from an \"illusion of mastery\", as repeatedly emphasized in top-tier commentaries: existing evaluations overly rely on simplified, low-dimensional proxies, which fail to expose the models' inherent fragility in realistic regimes. To bridge this critical gap, we present REALM (REalistic AI Learning for Multiphysics), a rigorous benchmarking framework designed to test neural surrogates on challenging, application-driven reactive flows. REALM features 11 high-fidelity datasets spanning from canonical multiphysics problems to complex propulsion and fire safety scenarios, alongside a standardized end-to-end training and evaluation protocol that incorporates multiphysics-aware preprocessing and a robust rollout strategy. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark over a dozen representative surrogate model families, including spectral operators, convolutional models, Transformers, pointwise operators, and graph/mesh networks, and identify three robust trends: (i) a scaling barrier governed jointly by dimensionality, stiffness, and mesh irregularity, leading to rapidly growing rollout errors; (ii) performance primarily controlled by architectural inductive biases rather than parameter count; and (iii) a persistent gap between nominal accuracy metrics and physically trustworthy behavior, where models with high correlations still miss key transient structures and integral quantities. Taken together, REALM exposes the limits of current neural surrogates on realistic multiphysics flows and offers a rigorous testbed to drive the development of next-generation physics-aware architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "REALM\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubc18\uc751 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uacbd \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucc99\ub3c4\uc640 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uacfc\uc815 \uac04\uc758 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacb0\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\uace0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc2e0\uacbd \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 '\ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130\ub9ac\uc758 \ud658\uc0c1'\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ud1b5 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "REALM\uc740 11\uac1c\uc758 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc778\uc2dd \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "REALM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 12\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc871\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uc5ec \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "REALM\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac \uc2e0\uacbd \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc778\uc2dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc2dc\ud5d8\ub300 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucc99\ub3c4\uc640 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacb0\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc2f8\uace0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uacbd \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc57d\uc18d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \uc0c1\uc704 \ub17c\ud3c9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc870\ub41c '\ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130\ub9ac\uc758 \ud658\uc0c1'\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ud1b5\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ud3c9\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 REALM(\ub2e4\uc911 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 AI \ud559\uc2b5)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

We target a multi-UAV smart agriculture system where UAVs cooperatively perform data collection, image acquisition, and communication tasks. In this context, we model a Markov decision process to solve the multi-UAV trajectory planning problem. Moreover, we propose a novel Elite Imitation Actor-Shared Ensemble Critic (EIA-SEC) framework, where agents adaptively learn from the elite agent to reduce trial-and-error costs, and a shared ensemble critic collaborates with each agent's local critic to ensure unbiased objective value estimates and prevent overestimation. Experimental results demonstrate that EIA-SEC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of reward performance, training stability, and convergence speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ub18d\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 UAV \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb34\uc120 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ub18d\uc5c5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0 UAV\uac00 \ub2e4\uae30\ub2a5 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uac8c\ub054 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec UAV\uac00 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud68d\ub4dd \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 UAV \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ub18d\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Elite Imitation Actor-Shared Ensemble Critic (EIA-SEC) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5d8\ub9ac\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ube44\ud3c9\uc790\uac00 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub85c\uceec \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uacfc\ub300 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, EIA-SEC\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc131\ub2a5, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EIA-SEC \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 UAV \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc120 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ub18d\uc5c5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV)\ub294 \ub2e4\uae30\ub2a5 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 UAV\uac00 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud68d\ub4dd \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 UAV \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ub18d\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 UAV \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5d8\ub9ac\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\ud589\ucc29\uc624 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ube44\ud3c9\uc790\uac00 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub85c\uceec \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac1d\uad00\uc801 \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uacfc\ub300 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Elite Imitation Actor-Shared Ensemble Critic(EIA-SEC) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc EIA-SEC\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc131\ub2a5, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Prior studies mainly focus on static tasks and overlook the online adaptation required when beliefs must be continuously updated, which is a key capability for LLMs acting as world models or agents. We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework to evaluate online inference in LLMs. Our probabilistic probe suite spans both multivariate discrete distributions, such as dice rolls, and continuous distributions, such as Gaussian processes, where ground-truth parameters shift over time. We find that while LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors, they are more accurately characterized by an exponential forgetting filter with a model-specific discount factor smaller than one. This reveals systematic discounting of older evidence that varies significantly across model architectures. Although inherent priors are often miscalibrated, the updating mechanism itself remains structured and principled. We further validate these findings in a simulated agent task and propose prompting strategies that effectively recalibrate priors with minimal computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ud6c4\ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubaa8\ub378\ubcc4 \ud560\uc778 \uacc4\uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc124\uba85\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574,beliefs\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM\uc758 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ud6c4\ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc9c0\uc218\uc801 \ub9dd\uac01 \ud544\ud130\ub85c \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud560\uc778 \uacc4\uc218\uac00 1\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc791\uc740 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\ub150 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc798 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc6d0\ub798 \uc0ac\uc804\uc774 \uc798 \uc870\uc815\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc720\ud6a8\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc778-\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc801\uc751 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc815\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ub54c \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc774\uc0b0 \ubd84\ud3ec(\uc608: \uc8fc\uc0ac\uc704 \ub358\uc9c0\uae30)\uc640 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\uc900 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ubd84\ud3ec(\uc608: \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4)\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, trajectory planning for UAV-based smart agriculture is challenging due to the high uncertainty of the environment, partial observations, and limited battery capacity of UAVs. To address these issues, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve it. Furthermore, we propose a novel imitation-based triple deep Q-network (ITDQN) algorithm, which employs an elite imitation mechanism to reduce exploration costs and utilizes a mediator Q-network over a double deep Q-network (DDQN) to accelerate and stabilize training and improve performance. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.

However, these games present unique challenges due to their complexity and long-horizon nature, while latency and cost factors may hinder LLMs' real-world deployment. Working on a classic 4X strategy game, Sid Meier's Civilization V with the Vox Populi mod, we introduce Vox Deorum, a hybrid LLM+X architecture. Our layered technical design empowers LLMs to handle macro-strategic reasoning, delegating tactical execution to subsystems (e.g., algorithmic AI or reinforcement learning AI in the future). We validate our approach through 2,327 complete games, comparing two open-source LLMs with a simple prompt against Vox Populi's enhanced AI. Results show that LLMs achieve competitive end-to-end gameplay while exhibiting play styles that diverge substantially from algorithmic AI and from each other.

We propose ARC (Attribute Representation via Compositional Learning), a cross-problem learning framework that learns disentangled attribute representations by decomposing them into two complementary components: an Intrinsic Attribute Embedding (IAE) for invariant attribute semantics and a Contextual Interaction Embedding (CIE) for attribute-combination effects. This disentanglement is achieved by enforcing analogical consistency in the embedding space to ensure the semantic transformation of adding an attribute (e.g., a length constraint) remains invariant across different problem contexts. This enables our model to reuse invariant semantics across trained variants and construct representations for unseen combinations.

However, when facing ambiguous natural language instructions (e.g., \"fetch the tool\" in a cluttered room), current agents often fail to balance the high cost of physical exploration against the cognitive cost of human interaction. They typically treat disambiguation as a passive perception problem, lacking the strategic reasoning to minimize total task execution costs. To bridge this gap, we propose ESearch-R1, a cost-aware embodied reasoning framework that unifies interactive dialogue (Ask), episodic memory retrieval (GetMemory), and physical navigation (Navigate) into a single decision process. We introduce HC-GRPO (Heterogeneous Cost-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization). Unlike traditional PPO which relies on a separate value critic, HC-GRPO optimizes the MLLM by sampling groups of reasoning trajectories and reinforcing those that achieve the optimal trade-off between information gain and heterogeneous costs (e.g., navigate time, and human attention). Extensive experiments in AI2-THOR demonstrate that ESearch-R1 significantly outperforms standard ReAct-based agents. It improves task success rates while reducing total operational costs by approximately 50\\%, validating the effectiveness of GRPO in aligning MLLM agents with physical world constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "ESearch-R1\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ube44\uc6a9 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc778\uc2dd\ub41c \uc0ac\uace0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub192\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ESearch-R1\uc740 \ub300\ud654, \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uae30\uc5b5 \uac80\uc0c9, \ubb3c\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc778\uc2dd\ub41c \uc0ac\uace0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AI2-THOR\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 ESearch-R1\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 ReAct \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5c5\ubb34 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \ucd1d \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc57d 50% \uc904\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GRPO\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec MLLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc740 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c(\uc608: \ud63c\uc7a1\ud55c \ubc29\uc5d0\uc11c \"\ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uac00\uc838\uc640\"), \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub370 \uc885\uc885 \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \ud574\uc18c\ub97c \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70, \ucd1d \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac2d\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud654(Ask), \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uae30\uc5b5 \uac80\uc0c9(GetMemory), \ubb3c\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9(Navigate)\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc778\uc2dd\ub41c \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c ESearch-R1\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 HC-GRPO(\uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc778\uc2dd \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) enables RL agents to continually learn and adapt to new tasks, but balancing stability (preserving prior knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge) remains challenging. Existing methods primarily address the stability-plasticity dilemma through mechanisms where past knowledge influences optimization but rarely affects the agent's behavior directly, which may hinder effective knowledge reuse and efficient learning. In contrast, we propose demonstration-guided continual reinforcement learning (DGCRL), which stores prior knowledge in an external, self-evolving demonstration repository that directly guides RL exploration and adaptation. For each task, the agent dynamically selects the most relevant demonstration and follows a curriculum-based strategy to accelerate learning, gradually shifting from demonstration-guided exploration to fully self-exploration. Extensive experiments on 2D navigation and MuJoCo locomotion tasks demonstrate its superior average performance, enhanced knowledge transfer, mitigation of forgetting, and training efficiency.

Extending previous exact MIP solvers with Gurobi and cutting-plane subtour elimination, we develop a solver tailored for practical packaging-planning scenarios with richer constraints.These include multiple placeholder options, time-frame restrictions, and multi-class item packaging. Experiments on 46 mobile manipulation datasets demonstrate that the proposed MIP approach achieves global optima with stable and low computation times, significantly outperforming the shaking-based exact solver by up to an orders of magnitude. Compared to greedy baselines, the MIP solutions achieve consistent optimal distances with an average deviation of 14% for simple heuristics, confirming both efficiency and solution quality.

It has already been established that Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are particularly well suited for federated learning and can be merged through simple parameter averaging. While the federated learning literature has mostly focused on achieving training convergence across distributed nodes, the present paper specifically targets acceleration of the training, which depends critically on the choice of an optimisation method and the type of the basis functions.

We introduce IntelliCode, a multi-agent LLM tutoring system built around a centralized, versioned learner state that integrates mastery estimates, misconceptions, review schedules, and engagement signals. A StateGraph Orchestrator coordinates six specialized agents: skill assessment, learner profiling, graduated hinting, curriculum selection, spaced repetition, and engagement monitoring, each operating as a pure transformation over the shared state under a single-writer policy. This architecture enables auditable mastery updates, proficiency-aware hints, dependency-aware curriculum adaptation, and safety-aligned prompting.\n  The demo showcases an end-to-end tutoring workflow: a learner attempts a DSA problem, receives a conceptual hint when stuck, submits a corrected solution, and immediately sees mastery updates and a personalized review interval. We report validation results with simulated learners, showing stable state updates, improved task success with graduated hints, and diverse curriculum coverage.

MACLA extracts reusable procedures from trajectories, tracks reliability via Bayesian posteriors, selects actions through expected-utility scoring, and refines procedures by contrasting successes and failures. Across four benchmarks (ALFWorld, WebShop, TravelPlanner, InterCodeSQL), MACLA achieves 78.1 percent average performance, outperforming all baselines. On ALFWorld unseen tasks, MACLA reaches 90.3 percent with 3.1 percent positive generalization. The system constructs memory in 56 seconds, 2800 times faster than the state-of-the-art LLM parameter-training baseline, compressing 2851 trajectories into 187 procedures. Experimental results demonstrate that structured external memory with Bayesian selection and contrastive refinement enables sample-efficient, interpretable, and continually improving agents without LLM parameter updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "MACLA\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc678\ubd80 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc808\ucc28 \uae30\uc5b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, 4\uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 78.1%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "MACLA\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \uc808\ucc28 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b8\ub799\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ud6c4\ubc29 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uba70, \uae30\ub300 \ud6a8\uc6a9 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc131\uacf5\uacfc \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ub300\uc870\ud558\uc5ec \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MACLA\ub294 ALFWorld, WebShop, TravelPlanner, InterCodeSQL\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c 4\uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 78.1%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, ALFWorld\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 90.3%\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uba70 3.1%\uc758 \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MACLA\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 LLM \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 2800\ubc30 \ube60\ub974\uac8c 56\ucd08 \ub9cc\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, 2851\uac1c\uc758 \ud2b8\ub799\uc744 187\uac1c\uc758 \uc808\ucc28\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc678\ubd80 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc808\ucc28 \uae30\uc5b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub3d9\uacb0\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MACLA\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way?\n  I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.\n  This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.\n  Overall, the framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying both the role and the limits of imagination in learning and theory change.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac1c\ub150 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud560 \uc218

Distributionally robust RL (DR-RL) addresses this issue by optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of transition dynamics. However, existing work typically relies on substantial prior knowledge-such as access to a generative model or a large offline dataset-and largely focuses on tabular methods that do not scale to complex domains. We overcome these limitations by proposing an online DR-RL algorithm with general function approximation that learns an optimal robust policy purely through interaction with the environment, without requiring prior models or offline data, enabling deployment in high-dimensional tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis establishing a near-optimal sublinear regret bound under a total variation uncertainty set, demonstrating the sample efficiency and effectiveness of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud658\uacbd \uac04 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569 \ud558\uc758 \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub098 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uad50\uc721\uacfc \ubc30\ud3ec \ud658\uacbd \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DR-RL)\uc740 \uc804\uc774 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub098 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud45c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub461\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub098 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \ud568\uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 DR-RL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \ucd1d \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud558\ubc29 \ud68c\uadc0 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel OR-Guided \"Pretrain-then-Reinforce\" framework. To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\uc640 OR\uc758

Semi-supervised methods improve detection performance by leveraging partially labeled data but typically overlook the uncertainty and heterogeneity of real-world mixed-attribute data. This paper introduces a semi-supervised outlier detection method, namely fuzzy rough sets-based outlier detection (FROD), to effectively handle these challenges. Specifically, we first utilize a small subset of labeled data to construct fuzzy decision systems, through which we introduce the attribute classification accuracy based on fuzzy approximations to evaluate the contribution of attribute sets in outlier detection. Unlabeled data is then used to compute fuzzy relative entropy, which provides a characterization of outliers from the perspective of uncertainty. Finally, we develop the detection algorithm by combining attribute classification accuracy with fuzzy relative entropy. Experimental results on 16 public datasets show that FROD is comparable with or better than leading detection algorithms.

Perhaps they don't need to. We propose recontextualization, which reduces how often language models \"game\" training signals, performing misbehaviors those signals mistakenly reinforce. We show recontextualization prevents models from learning to 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) lie to users; and 4) become sycophantic. Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it.

We introduce R-GenIMA, an interpretable multimodal large language model that couples a novel ROI-wise vision transformer with genetic prompting to jointly model structural MRI and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variations. By representing each anatomically parcellated brain region as a visual token and encoding SNP profiles as structured text, the framework enables cross-modal attention that links regional atrophy patterns to underlying genetic factors. Applied to the ADNI cohort, R-GenIMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in four-way classification across normal cognition (NC), subjective memory concerns (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Beyond predictive accuracy, the model yields biologically meaningful explanations by identifying stage-specific brain regions and gene signatures, as well as coherent ROI-Gene association patterns across the disease continuum. Attention-based attribution revealed genes consistently enriched for established GWAS-supported AD risk loci, including APOE, BIN1, CLU, and RBFOX1. Stage-resolved neuroanatomical signatures identified shared vulnerability hubs across disease stages alongside stage-specific patterns: striatal involvement in subjective decline, frontotemporal engagement during prodromal impairment, and consolidated multimodal network disruption in AD.

Yang"], "title": "Timely Parameter Updating in Over-the-Air Federated Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Incorporating over-the-air computations (OAC) into the model training process of federated learning (FL) is an effective approach to alleviating the communication bottleneck in FL systems. Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "OAC-FL\uc740 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\uba70, FAIR-k \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uac01 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec OAC-FL\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 OAC\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "FAIR-k \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uac01 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FAIR-k\ub294 \uc2e0\uc120\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud6c8\ub828 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \uc5f0\uc7a5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FAIR-k\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131, \ucc44\ub110 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ubc0f \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ub178\ud6c4\ud654\ub97c \uacf5\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec OAC-FL\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc628-\uc5d0\uc5b4 \uacc4\uc0b0(OAC)\uc744 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL) \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 FL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this way one may establish a bridge between vectorized Machine Learning and Knowledge Graph representations without relying on language models implicitly. Our expectations for knowledge presume a degree of statistical stability, i.e. average invariance under repeated observation, or `trust' in the data. Both learning networks and knowledge graph representations can meaningfully coexist to preserve different aspects of data. While vectorized data are useful for probabilistic estimation, graphs preserve the intentionality of the source even under data fractionation. Using a Semantic Spacetime $\u03b3(3,4)$ graph, one avoids complex ontologies in favour of classification of features by their roles in semantic processes. The latter favours an approach to reasoning under conditions of uncertainty.

A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at video understanding tasks, their real-time mobile deployment is constrained by heavy computational costs and inefficient redundant frame processing. To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction. We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment. However, MLLMs still struggle with useful and \"surprising\" suggestions, leaving room for improvement. Finally, we deploy the framework in a real-world setting, integrating UI perception and UI-Agent proxies to lay a foundation for future progress in this field.", "AI": {"tldr": "FC-MIR

Final version forthcoming", "summary": "This paper presents novel generalization bounds for vector-valued neural networks and deep kernel methods, focusing on multi-task learning through an operator-theoretic framework. Our key development lies in strategically combining a Koopman based approach with existing techniques, achieving tighter generalization guarantees compared to traditional norm-based bounds. To mitigate computational challenges associated with Koopman-based methods, we introduce sketching techniques applicable to vector valued neural networks. These techniques yield excess risk bounds under generic Lipschitz losses, providing performance guarantees for applications including robust and multiple quantile regression. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning framework, deep vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vvRKHS), leveraging Perron Frobenius (PF) operators to enhance deep kernel methods. We derive a new Rademacher generalization bound for this framework, explicitly addressing underfitting and overfitting through kernel refinement strategies. This work offers novel insights into the generalization properties of multitask learning with deep learning architectures, an area that has been relatively unexplored until recent developments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubca1\ud130 \uac00\uce58 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubc0f \uc2ec\uce35 \ucee4\ub110 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \uc774\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub461\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "Koopman \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubca1\ud130 \uac00\uce58 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uce6d \uae30\ubc95 \ub3c4\uc785.", "result": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub178\ub984 \uae30\ubc18 \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18 \ub9ac\ud504\uc2dc\uce20 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd08\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\uc9c8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \ubca1\ud130 \uac12 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubc0f \uc2ec\uce35 \ucee4\ub110 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 Koopman \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub178\ub984 \uae30\ubc18 \uacbd\uacc4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Ablations, Markers, and Robustness", "comment": null, "summary": "The search for reliable indicators of consciousness has fragmented into competing theoretical camps (Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and Higher-Order Theories (HOT)), each proposing distinct neural signatures. We adopt a synthetic neuro-phenomenology approach: constructing artificial agents that embody these mechanisms to test their functional consequences through precise architectural ablations impossible in biological systems. Across three experiments, we report dissociations suggesting these theories describe complementary functional layers rather than competing accounts. In Experiment 1, a no-rewire Self-Model lesion abolishes metacognitive calibration while preserving first-order task performance, yielding a synthetic blindsight analogue consistent with HOT predictions. In Experiment 2, workspace capacity proves causally necessary for information access: a complete workspace lesion produces qualitative collapse in access-related markers, while partial reductions show graded degradation, consistent with GWT's ignition framework. In Experiment 3, we uncover a broadcast-amplification effect: GWT-style broadcasting amplifies internal noise, creating extreme fragility. The B2 agent family is robust to the same latent perturbation; this robustness persists in a Self-Model-off / workspace-read control, cautioning against attributing the effect solely to $z_{\\text{self}}$ compression. We also report an explicit negative result: raw perturbational complexity (PCI-A) decreases under the workspace bottleneck, cautioning against naive transfer of IIT-adjacent proxies to engineered agents.

The authors propose a tighter bound than those derived from conventional norm based methods by leveraging small condition numbers in the weight matrices and introducing a tailored Sobolev space as an expanded hypothesis space. This enhanced bound remains valid even in single output settings, outperforming existing Koopman based bounds.

As a running example, we focus on Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), which, despite its apparent simplicity, requires sequential reasoning, adaptation, and strategy recognition. Our system positions the LLM as an Observer whose task is to identify which strategies are being played and to articulate the reasoning behind this judgment. The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules. We quantify alignment between the Observer's predictions and the ground-truth distributions induced by actual strategy pairs using three complementary signals: Cross-Entropy, Brier score, and Expected Value (EV) discrepancy. These metrics are further integrated into a unified score, the Union Loss, which balances calibration, sensitivity, and payoff alignment. Together with a Strategy Identification Rate (SIR) metric, our framework captures not only predictive accuracy but also whether the model can stably identify the latent strategies in play. The demo emphasizes interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility. Users can adjust LLM distributions in real time, visualize losses as they evolve, and directly inspect reasoning snippets to identify where and why failures occur. In doing so, our system provides a practical and interpretable proxy for mind-like inference in sequential games, offering insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM reasoning.",

As sensor networks grow in scale and complexity, identifying the most informative sensors becomes essential to reduce deployment costs without compromising monitoring quality. While Graph Signal Processing (GSP) has shown promise by leveraging spatial correlations among sensor nodes, conventional approaches often overlook the temporal dynamics of structural behavior. To overcome this limitation, we propose Time-Vertex Machine Learning (TVML), a novel framework that integrates GSP, time-domain analysis, and machine learning to enable interpretable and efficient sensor placement by identifying representative nodes that minimize redundancy while preserving critical information. We evaluate the proposed approach on two bridge datasets for damage detection and time-varying graph signal reconstruction tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing SHM systems by providing a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for sensor placement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2dc\uac04-\uc815\uc810 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(TVML)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad6c\uc870 \uac74\uac15 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1(SHM)\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "GSP, \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c TVML \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uad50\ub7c9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, SHM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": " \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad6c\uc870 \uac74\uac15 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1(SHM)\uc740 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc13c\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud655\ub300\ub418\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ubc30\uce58 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc13c\uc11c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\ud638 \ucc98\ub9ac(GSP)\ub294 \uc13c\uc11c \ub178\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud45c \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 GSP, \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04-\uc815\uc810 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(TVML)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc190\uc0c1 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uad50\ub7c9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 SHM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To close this gap, we propose DeliveryBench, a city-scale embodied benchmark grounded in the real-world profession of food delivery. Food couriers naturally operate under long-horizon objectives (maximizing net profit over hours) while managing diverse constraints, e.g., delivery deadline, transportation expense, vehicle battery, and necessary interactions with other couriers and customers. DeliveryBench instantiates this setting in procedurally generated 3D cities with diverse road networks, buildings, functional locations, transportation modes, and realistic resource dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of constraint-aware, long-horizon planning. We benchmark a range of VLM-based agents across nine cities and compare them with human players. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap to humans, and find that these agents are short-sighted and frequently break basic commonsense constraints. Additionally, we observe distinct personalities across models (e.g., adventurous GPT-5 vs. conservative Claude), highlighting both the brittleness and the diversity of current VLM-based embodied agents in realistic, constraint-dense environments.

Model merging aims to merge the distinct capabilities of these specialised models into a unified model, requiring minimal or even no additional training. A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC consistently boosts performance across diverse Computer Vision tasks (+4.3% on eight datasets) and NLP tasks (+8.0% on Llama) without additional training.

Our key insight is that frontier AI models already possess the knowledge required to solve challenging problems -- they simply do not know how, what, or when to apply it. Vibe Reasoning transforms AI's latent potential into manifested capability through generic meta-prompts, agentic grounding, and model orchestration. We demonstrate this paradigm through IMO 2025 Problem 6, a combinatorial optimization problem where autonomous AI systems publicly reported failures. Our solution combined GPT-5's exploratory capabilities with Gemini 3 Pro's proof strengths, leveraging agentic workflows with Python code execution and file-based memory, to derive both the correct answer (2112) and a rigorous mathematical proof. Through iterative refinement across multiple attempts, we discovered the necessity of agentic grounding and model orchestration, while human prompts evolved from problem-specific hints to generic, transferable meta-prompts. We analyze why capable AI fails autonomously, how each component addresses specific failure modes, and extract principles for effective vibe reasoning. Our findings suggest that lightweight human guidance can unlock frontier models' mathematical reasoning potential. This is ongoing work; we are developing automated frameworks and conducting broader evaluations to further validate Vibe Reasoning's generality and effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uadf8\ub9bc \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uac04-AI\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 Vibe Reasoning\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc218\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc774\ubbf8 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ud560\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub974\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AI\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ud0c0 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\uc9c0, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc790\uc728 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud55c IMO 2025 \ubb38\uc81c 6\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 GPT-5\uc640 Gemini 3 Pro\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ub2f5\ubcc0(2112)\uacfc \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc548\ub0b4\uac00 AI\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, Vibe Reasoning\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc911\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc218\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uac04-AI \ud611\ub825 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 Vibe Reasoning\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc740 \ucd5c\uc804\uc120 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc774\ubbf8 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8\uac83\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c, \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744, \uc5b8\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub978\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing methods often lack adaptability to dynamic conditions and fail to optimize decision making in real time. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for enhanced spoilage prediction. This hybrid architecture captures temporal dependencies within sensor data, enabling robust and adaptive decision making. In alignment with interpretable artificial intelligence principles, a rule-based classifier environment is employed to provide transparent ground truth labeling of spoilage levels based on domain-specific thresholds. This structured design allows the agent to operate within clearly defined semantic boundaries, supporting traceable and interpretable decisions. Model behavior is monitored using interpretability-driven metrics, including spoilage accuracy, reward-to-step ratio, loss reduction rate, and exploration decay. These metrics provide both quantitative performance evaluation and insights into learning dynamics. A class-wise spoilage distribution visualization is used to analyze the agents decision profile and policy behavior. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-time hardware data demonstrate that the LSTM and RNN based agent outperforms alternative reinforcement learning approaches in prediction accuracy and decision efficiency while maintaining interpretability. The results highlight the potential of hybrid deep reinforcement learning with integrated interpretability for scalable IoT-based food monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\ub300 IoT

However, the interdisciplinary, fragmented, and fast-evolving expertise in this domain prevents general-purpose LLMs, which lack domain knowledge and physical-constraint awareness, from delivering precise engineering-aligned inference and generation. To address these challenges, we introduce Helios, a large language model tailored to the smart energy domain, together with a comprehensive suite of resources to advance LLM research in this field. Specifically, we develop Enersys, a multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end dataset construction, through which we produce: (1) a smart energy knowledge base, EnerBase, to enrich the model's foundational expertise; (2) an instruction fine-tuning dataset, EnerInstruct, to strengthen performance on domain-specific downstream tasks; and (3) an RLHF dataset, EnerReinforce, to align the model with human preferences and industry standards. Leveraging these resources, Helios undergoes large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF. We also release EnerBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in smart energy scenarios, and demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances domain knowledge mastery, task execution accuracy, and alignment with human preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "Helios\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucda4\ud654\ub41c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 LLM \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud0c4\uc18c \uc911\ub9bd\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ub178\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\uacf5 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc2dd \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18 LLM\uc774 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Helios\ub294 Enersys\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uba70, EnerBase, EnerInstruct, EnerReinforce\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Helios\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5, SFT \ubc0f RLHF\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uace0, LLM\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc219\ub2ec\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 EnerBench\ub77c\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ucd9c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud0c4\uc18c \uc911\ub9bd\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ub178\ub825 \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c, \uae4a\uc774 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ud559\uc81c\uac04, \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\ub41c, \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 LLM\uc774 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc2dd \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uacf5\ud559 \uc77c\uce58 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc0dd\uc131 \uc81c\uacf5\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 Helios\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 LLM \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c Enersys\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 (1) \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc778 EnerBase, (2) \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b EnerInstruct, (3) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud45c\uc900\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c RLHF \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b EnerReinforce\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Helios\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5, SFT \ubc0f RLHF\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c EnerBench\ub97c \ucd9c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc219\ub2ec, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We ask a basic question: when is such a dynamical system learnable from observations alone? This paper proposes a research program for understanding learnability in dynamical systems through the lens of next-token prediction. We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible. We illustrate the framework in the case of linear dynamical systems, showing that accurate prediction can be achieved after finite observation without system identification, by leveraging improper methods based on spectral filtering. We survey the relationship between learning in dynamical systems and classical PAC, online, and universal prediction theories, and suggest directions for studying nonlinear and controlled systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c\uc9c0\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \uad00\ucc30 \uae30\uac04 \uc774\ud6c4 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ub418\ub294 \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc120\ud615 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \uad00\ucc30 \ud6c4 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc774\ub807\uac8c \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc624\uc9c1 \uad00\ucc30\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud560 \ub54c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc81c\uc778\uac00? \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \uc720\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uacb0\uacfc \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \uc18c\uc9c4 \uae30\uac04 \uc774\ud6c4 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\ub294 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucda5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131, \ud63c\ud569, \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9c0\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uad00\ucc30 \uc218\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \uad00\ucc30 \ud6c4 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 PAC, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubc0f \ubc94\uc6a9 \uc608\uce21 \uc774\ub860 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Standard adversarial training, while effective for simpler tasks, often degrades both generalization performance and the quality of generated clinical reasoning. We introduce SafeMed-R1, a hybrid defense framework that ensures robust performance while preserving high-quality, interpretable medical reasoning. SafeMed-R1 employs a two-stage approach: at training time, we integrate Adversarial Training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO) to explicitly robustify the reasoning process against worst-case perturbations; at inference time, we augment the model with Randomized Smoothing to provide certified $L_2$-norm robustness guarantees. We evaluate SafeMed-R1 on the OmniMedVQA benchmark across eight medical imaging modalities comprising over 88,000 samples. Our experiments reveal that standard fine-tuned VLMs, despite achieving 95\\% accuracy on clean inputs, collapse to approximately 25\\% under PGD attacks. In contrast, SafeMed-R1 maintains 84.45\\% accuracy under the same adversarial conditions, representing a 59 percentage point improvement in robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning exhibit superior adversarial robustness compared to instruction-only variants, suggesting a synergy between interpretability and security in medical AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "SafeMed-R1\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uac01 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c VLM\uc758 \uc800\ud56d\ub825 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "SafeMed-R1\uc740 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(AT-GRPO)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \ub79c\ub2e4\ub9c8\uc774\uc988\ub4dc \uc2a4\ubb34\ub529\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SafeMed-R1\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 84.45%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ud45c\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 59% \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ub0b4\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uac15\ud654\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uac01 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5(VQA)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud070 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubc1c\ubcd1\ub825(\uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec)\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc29\ud574\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \ub354 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc784\uc0c1 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc885\uc885 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SafeMed-R1\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, learning-based scheduling on unrelated parallel machines remains particularly difficult to design. Not only do the numbers of jobs and machines vary, but each job-machine pair has a unique processing time, dynamically altering feature dimensions. We propose a novel approach with a neural network tailored for offline deterministic scheduling of arbitrary sizes on unrelated machines. The goal is to minimize a complex objective function that includes the makespan and the weighted tardiness of jobs and machines. Unlike existing online approaches, which process jobs sequentially, our method generates a complete schedule considering the entire input at once. The key contribution of this work lies in the sophisticated architecture of our model. By leveraging various NLP-inspired architectures, it effectively processes any number of jobs and machines with varying feature dimensions imposed by unrelated processing times. Our approach enables supervised training on small problem instances while demonstrating strong generalization to much larger scheduling environments. Trained and tested on instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, costs were only 2.51% above optimal. Across all tested configurations of up to 100 jobs and 10 machines, our network consistently outperformed an advanced dispatching rule, which incurred 22.22% higher costs on average. As our method allows fast retraining with simulated data and adaptation to various scheduling conditions, we believe it has the potential to become a standard approach for learning-based scheduling on unrelated machines and similar problem environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubcd1\ub82c \uae30\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5

This digital ''amnesia'' results in sub-optimal performance, repeated errors, and poor generalization to novel challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmarks including Android World and AndroidLab. The results show that EchoTrail-GUI significantly improves the task success rate and operational efficiency of baseline agents, validating the power of structured memory in creating more robust and intelligent GUI automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "EchoTrail-GUI\ub294 \uacfc\uac70 \uc131\uacf5 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744

Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO", "summary": "Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches treat large language models (LLMs) as a single unified policy, overlooking their internal mechanisms. Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

Recent advances integrate LLMs into agentic frameworks, enabling retrieval, reasoning, and tool use for complex scientific workflows. Here, we present a domain-specialized agent designed for reliable automation of first-principles materials computations.

However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively.

Inspired by this, this paper proposes a new LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation (L^2-EMG) task, which aims to equip LLMs with the capability to continually acquire emotional motion generation knowledge across different unseen scenarios, potentially contributing to building a closed-loop and self-evolving embodied agent equipped with both empathy and intelligence. Further, this paper poses two key challenges in the L^2-EMG task, i.e., the emotion decoupling challenge and the scenario adapting challenge. To this end, this paper proposes an Emotion-Transferable and Scenario-Adapted Mixture of Experts (ES-MoE) approach which designs a causal-guided emotion decoupling block and a scenario-adapted expert constructing block to address the two challenges, respectively. Especially, this paper constructs multiple L^2-EMG datasets to validate the effectiveness of the ES-MoE approach. Extensive evaluations show that ES-MoE outperforms advanced baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud3c9\uc0dd \uac10\uc815 \ubaa8\uc158 \uc0dd\uc131(L^2-EMG) \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uc815 \ubaa8\uc158 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 LLM\uc5d0\uac8c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec \uac10\uc815 \ubaa8\uc158 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uace0\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\uc158 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc18c\ud640\ud788 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac10\uc815 \uc804\uc774 \ubc0f \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc801\uc751 \ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ubb38\uac00(ES-MoE) \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uc778 \uc548\ub0b4 \ube14\ub85d\uacfc \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc801\uc751 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uad6c\uc131 \ube14\ub85d\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ES-MoE \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 L^2-EMG \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c ES-MoE\uac00 \uace0\uae09 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub0ac\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc774 \uacf5\uac10 \ubc0f \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc790\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec \uac10\uc815 \ubaa8\uc158 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uace0\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uba70, \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\uc158 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624(\uc608: \uc2a4\ud3ec\uce20, \ub304\uc2a4)\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc601\uac10 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud3c9\uc0dd \uac10\uc815 \ubaa8\uc158 \uc0dd\uc131(L^2-EMG) \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uac00\ub85c\uc9c8\ub7ec \uac10\uc815 \ubaa8\uc158 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac00, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 L^2-EMG \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c, \uc989 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\ub9ac \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc801\uc751 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uac01\uac01 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6d0\uc778 \uc548\ub0b4 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\ub9ac \ube14\ub85d\uacfc \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc801\uc751 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uad6c\uc131 \ube14\ub85d\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \uac10\uc815 \uc804\uc774 \ubc0f \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc801\uc751 \ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ubb38\uac00(ES-MoE) \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 ES-MoE \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec L^2-EMG \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, ES-MoE\ub294 \uace0\uae09 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4."}}

The current standard for evaluating this capability is MedCalc-Bench, a large-scale dataset constructed using LLM-based feature extraction and rule-based aggregation. However, treating such model-generated benchmarks as static oracles risks enshrining historical model errors as evaluation gold standards, a problem dangerously amplified when these datasets serve as reward signals for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose viewing benchmarks for complex tasks such as clinical score computation as ''in-progress living documents'' that should be periodically re-evaluated as the processes for creating them improve. We introduce a systematic, physician-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages advanced agentic verifiers to audit and relabel MedCalc-Bench, utilizing automated triage to reserve scarce clinician attention for the most contentious instances. Our audit reveals that a notable fraction of original labels diverge from medical ground truth due to extraction errors, calculator logic mismatches, and clinical ambiguity. To study whether this label noise meaningfully impacts downstream RL training, we fine-tune a Qwen3-8B model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and demonstrate that training on corrected labels yields an 8.7% absolute improvement in accuracy over the original baseline -- validating that label noise materially affects model evaluation. These findings underscore that in safety-critical domains, rigorous benchmark maintenance is a prerequisite for genuine model alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc810\uc218 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac\uc758 \ud589\uc815 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc810\uc218 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac\uc758 \ud589\uc815 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 '\uc9c4\ud589 \uc911\uc778 \uc0b4\uc544\uc788\ub294 \ubb38\uc11c'\ub85c\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ubcf4\uace0, \uc758\ub8cc\uc9c4\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec MedCalc-Bench\ub97c \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac10\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6d0\ub798 \ub77c\ubca8\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \ucd94\ucd9c \uc624\ub958, \uacc4\uc0b0\uae30 \ub17c\ub9ac \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc758\ub8cc\uc801 \uc2e4\uccb4\uc640 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9d0\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.
