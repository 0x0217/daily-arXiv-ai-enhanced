However, the validity of LLMs as\nproxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates\nLLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining\ndyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six\nstate-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a\nmoderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two\nlevels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation.\nResults reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however,\nan equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges. While a series of Two One-Sided\nTests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level\nequivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial\ndecision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These\nfindings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM\nwith proper validation checks. The dual-validation framework also provides LSCM\nresearchers with a guide to rigorous GABM development. For practitioners, this\nstudy offers evidence-based assessment for LLM selection for operational tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LSCM \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c

Pacheco", "Tom Lenaerts"], "title": "Evolution favours positively biased reasoning in sequential interactions with high future gains", "comment": "33 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Empirical evidence shows that human behaviour often deviates from\ngame-theoretical rationality. For instance, humans may hold unrealistic\nexpectations about future outcomes. As the evolutionary roots of such biases\nremain unclear, we investigate here how reasoning abilities and cognitive\nbiases co-evolve using Evolutionary Game Theory. In our model, individuals in a\npopulation deploy a variety of unbiased and biased level-k reasoning strategies\nto anticipate others' behaviour in sequential interactions, represented by the\nIncremental Centipede Game. Positively biased reasoning strategies have a\nsystematic inference bias towards higher but uncertain rewards, while\nnegatively biased strategies reflect the opposite tendency. We find that\nselection consistently favours positively biased reasoning, with rational\nbehaviour even going extinct. This bias co-evolves with bounded rationality, as\nthe reasoning depth remains limited in the population. Interestingly,\npositively biased agents may co-exist with non-reasoning agents, thus pointing\nto a novel equilibrium.

Based on these findings, we identified\nthree major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by\na specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal\ntime-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent\nthat integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,\npersonalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data\ninsights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking\nusers' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent\n(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions\nto address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the\nmulti-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10\nbenchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of\neffort from health experts and end-users.

Yet, realizing these benefits remains\nchallenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming\nin Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model\n(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming\nworkflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to\nspecialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,\nwe present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates\nOpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot\nlearning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,\npredefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents\nsystematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our\nevaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of\nvarying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\\%\ncompared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent\nsystem as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging\nexpertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "QAgent\ub294 OpenQASM \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "NISQ \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \uc591\uc790 \uc774\uc810 \uc2e4\ud604\uc774 \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uac8c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d, In-context few-shot learning, RAG \ub4f1\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "QAgent\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc815\uc801 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 QASM \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 71.6% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc591\uc790 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ubbfc\uc8fc\ud654\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uc591\uc790(NISQ) \uc7a5\uce58\uac00 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ubcf4\uc190 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \ud798\ub4e0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd08\uae30 \uc591\uc790 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uac8c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.

Two interacting large language models (Claude\nSonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of\nmeta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible\ncollaborative esthetic synthesis.

With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks\ntargeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware\nacross various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to\nextend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep\nlearning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of\nlabeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient\nmalware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage\nthe ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for\nmalware detection. Specifically, when dealing with malware in a certain ISA, we\ntranslate it to an ISA with sufficient malware samples (like X86-64).

While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art\nresults, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high\ncomputational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that\nlearnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model\nby enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a\nmultilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve\nthe issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish\nthat adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances\ntheir performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,\nwhich only add an additional $\\approx 1000$ parameters to several\ntransformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \\% relative\nimprovement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters\nadded, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting\nin transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective\nthan their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to\nanalyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the\nfull spectrum for forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Contextual MARL (cMARL)\naddresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and\ntraining a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment\nconfigurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to\nhelp train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on\nunreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage\nestimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to\ninter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we\npropose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with\nDiversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and\nprovide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage\nexploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism\nthat creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.\nExperiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D\nsignificantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to\nexisting curriculum learning baselines.

In\npart, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering\ntheory with modern inference architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub97c \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uce21\uc815\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uc804 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \uc774\ub860\uacfc \ud604\ub300 \ucd94\ub860 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc2dc\ub3c4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uce21\uc815\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uce35 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uace0\uc815\uc810 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378(HMM)\uc77c \ub54c \uace0\uc815\uc810 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ud615\ud0dc\uac00 \uc124\uba85\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub860\uacfc \ud604\ub300\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uac04\uc758 \ub2e4\ub9ac\ub97c \ub193\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "1940\ub144\ub300\uc5d0 Wiener\ub294 \uacfc\uac70 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc120\ud615 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \uc608\uce21\uae30\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub294 \uc774 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uacfc\uac70 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc74c \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc608\uce21\uae30\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5d0\uc138\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uce21\uc815\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uce35 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uace0\uc815\uc810 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378(HMM)\uc778 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uace0\uc815\uc810 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ud615\ud0dc\ub3c4 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80\ub294 \uace0\uc804 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \uc774\ub860\uacfc \ud604\ub300 \ucd94\ub860 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc2dc\ub3c4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While extensive research has focused on\nmitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively\nrejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and\nutility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce\nIntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard\nmodel to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query\nrewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.\nSpecifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising\napproximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety\nlabels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip\nthe guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent\nanalysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward\noptimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model\nsignals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance\nperformance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in\nmultiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak\nattack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing\nover-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 IntentionReasoner\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc548\uc804 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc720\ud574\ud55c \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc911\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "IntentionReasoner\ub294 \uc804\uc6a9 \uac00\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ub3c4 \ucd94\ub860, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc548\uc804 \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \ucffc\ub9ac \uc7ac\uc791\uc131 \ub4f1\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc IntentionReasoner\uac00 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uae30\uc900, \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "IntentionReasoner\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uac70\ubd80\uc728\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc751\ub2f5 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud070 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub178\ub825\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uac70\ubd80\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ubc18\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc548\uc804, \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uac70\ubd80 \ubc0f \uc720\uc6a9\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 IntentionReasoner\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc804\uc6a9 \uac00\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud574\ud55c \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc911\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc758\ub3c4 \ucd94\ub860, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc548\uc804 \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \ucffc\ub9ac \uc7ac\uc791\uc131\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc57d 163,000\uac1c\uc758 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uba3c\uc800 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uba70, \uac01 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4 \ucd94\ub860, \uc548\uc804 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uc791\uc131\ub41c \ubc84\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ub2ec\ub824 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ud6c4, \uac00\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud615\uc2dd \uc900\uc218, \uc758\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc7ac\uc791\uc0c1\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc IntentionReasoner\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc548\uc804 \uae30\uc900, \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uac70\ubd80\uc728\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc751\ub2f5 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paper serves to\nraise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when\nincorporating AI into a software system.

To\naddress this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and\nscalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful\ntraining samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a\nheld-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample\nloss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient\nand curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We\ndevelop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees\nfor CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is\nupper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the\nrepresentativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,\nCLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art\nmethods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally\nexpensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across\narchitectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with\n<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,\nincurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias\nreduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional\nstratified sampling.

Analysis of Student-ChatGPT Conversations from a Field Study", "comment": null, "summary": "This study explores how college students interact with generative AI\n(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of\nAI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when\nstudents had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315\nstudent-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various\nSTEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture\nstudents' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,\nand students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students\nexhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use\nAI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across\ninteractions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting\nstrategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral\nmetrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral\nmechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical\nimplications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It\nemphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's\nfamiliarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be\ndesigned with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.\nUltimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance

However, this trend\nintroduces a new threat: Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA), where tool metadata is\npoisoned to induce the agent to perform unauthorized operations. Existing\ndefenses that primarily focus on behavior-level analysis are fundamentally\nineffective against TPA, as poisoned tools need not be executed, leaving no\nbehavioral trace to monitor.\n  Thus, we propose MindGuard, a decision-level guardrail for LLM agents,\nproviding provenance tracking of call decisions, policy-agnostic detection, and\npoisoning source attribution against TPA. While fully explaining LLM decision\nremains challenging, our empirical findings uncover a strong correlation\nbetween LLM attention mechanisms and tool invocation decisions. Therefore, we\nchoose attention as an empirical signal for decision tracking and formalize\nthis as the Decision Dependence Graph (DDG), which models the LLM's reasoning\nprocess as a weighted, directed graph where vertices represent logical concepts\nand edges quantify the attention-based dependencies. We further design robust\nDDG construction and graph-based anomaly analysis mechanisms that efficiently\ndetect and attribute TPA attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that MindGuard achieves 94\\%-99\\% average precision in detecting\npoisoned invocations, 95\\%-100\\% attribution accuracy, with processing times\nunder one second and no additional token cost. Moreover, DDG can be viewed as\nan adaptation of the classical Program Dependence Graph (PDG), providing a\nsolid foundation for applying traditional security policies at the decision\nlevel.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\ub294 Model Context Protocol (MCP)\uc758 \ub3c4\uc785\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA) \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc774 TPA\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\uace0, MindGuard\ub77c\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uc815 \uc218\uc900 \uac00\ub4dc\ub808\uc77c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MCP\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, TPA\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MindGuard\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc758 \uacb0\uc815 \ucd94\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uac83\uc744 \uacb0\uc815 \uc758\uc874 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(DDG)\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Federated\nLearning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a\nnew solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented\nmedical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of\nthe full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT\nor MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction\nnetworks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity\nwhile preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like\ntumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by\nallowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.\nWe comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging\npipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI\nsystems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align\nheterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation.

Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined\ntarget; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of\nunexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,\nINS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),\nto enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our\nmethod integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that\nevaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling\nmechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they\nappear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a\npre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral\npairs.

Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a\npromising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions\nwith search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single\nLLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an\nend-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities\nsimultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a\nlarge, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a\nmore effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM\ndedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose\n\\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to\nenhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.\nSpecifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the\nArchitecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for\nSearch Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to\nachieve the objectives.

To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted\napproximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a\ncache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by\nbreaking isolation among users. This work aims to comprehensively assess new\nsecurity vulnerabilities arising from approximate caching. First, we\ndemonstrate a remote covert channel established with the cache, where a sender\ninjects prompts with special keywords into the cache and a receiver can recover\nthat even after days, to exchange information.

Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression\nhave automated this process. As several methods are available in the\nliterature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems\nthat describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression\nmethods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,\nincluding chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to\nbe the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its\nhigh predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable\nfrom the original analytical forms.

However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --\nclarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable\nsteps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.\nCounterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and\n`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).\n  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore\ncausal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all\ninterventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical\nscenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these\ncounterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.\n  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that\nproduces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable\noutcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both\nlimitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features\nand 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and\ncausally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system\ns(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen\nautomatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost\n(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,\nresulting in realistic cost estimates.

Unlike conventional malware, the prototype only\nrequires natural language prompts embedded in the binary; malicious code is\nsynthesized dynamically by the LLM at runtime, yielding polymorphic variants\nthat adapt to the execution environment. The system performs reconnaissance,\npayload generation, and personalized extortion, in a closed-loop attack\ncampaign without human involvement. We evaluate this threat across personal,\nenterprise, and embedded environments using a phase-centric methodology that\nmeasures quantitative fidelity and qualitative coherence in each attack phase.\nWe show that open source LLMs can generate functional ransomware components and\nsustain closed-loop execution across diverse environments.

This is the full version including extended\n  appendix", "summary": "Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and\ninferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they\nhelp account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby\naddressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper\nproposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the\ndouble machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect\nestimation in the presence of such hidden factors.

Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step\nin this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to\nautomatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data\ndiversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in\nreal-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world\napplications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from\ntask-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is\nvital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain\ndiversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.\n  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework\nthat systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and\ntask alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints\nspace, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models\nto generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall\nperformance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance\nby an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and\nin some cases outperforming leading closed-source models.

Still, its\ninterconnectivity exposes critical infrastructure to sophisticated cyber\nthreats, including adversarial attacks designed to bypass traditional\nsafeguards. Unlike general IoT risks, IoE threats have heightened public safety\nconsequences, demanding resilient solutions. From the networking-level\nsafeguard perspective, we propose a Graph Structure Learning (GSL)-based\nsafeguards framework that jointly optimizes graph topology and node\nrepresentations to resist adversarial network model manipulation inherently.\nThrough a conceptual overview, architectural discussion, and case study on a\nsecurity dataset, we demonstrate GSL's superior robustness over representative\nmethods, offering practitioners a viable path to secure IoE networks against\nevolving attacks. This work highlights the potential of GSL to enhance the\nresilience and reliability of future IoE networks for practitioners managing\ncritical infrastructure. Lastly, we identify key open challenges and propose\nfuture research directions in this novel research area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc778\ud130\ub137(IoE)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ubc29\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5(GSL) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "IoE\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc774 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5(GSL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc640 \ub178\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub85c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GSL\uc740 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, IoE \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GSL\uc740 \ubbf8\ub798 IoE \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc778\ud130\ub137(IoE)\uc740 IoT \uae30\ubc18 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc804\ub825\ub9dd\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \ub178\ucd9c\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18 IoT \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac IoE \uc704\ud611\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \uc548\uc804\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud0b9 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\ud56d\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ub178\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5(GSL) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uac1c\uc694, \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub17c\uc758 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GSL\uc774 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2c8\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 IoE \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc9c0\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 GSL\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 IoE \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uac1c\ubc29 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous\nvalue they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing\ndetection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address\nsingle-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address\nthis gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are\nwell-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the\ncomplex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield,\na detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain\ncoordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph\nrepresentation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn\nfine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path\nattention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling\nprecise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51\nreal-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an\naverage F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

Large language models\n(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring\ncontextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review\nexamines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare\nand common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,\nmedRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in\ndiagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated\nmodels. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in\ngenomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as\nmedical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate\nthat while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk\nstratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report\ngeneration, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic\nsequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust\npipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation\nin clinical settings.

We introduce a novel primitive, Proof-of-Transit\nTimestamping (PoTT), to provide cryptographic, tamper-evident audit trails for\nBitcoin data across high-latency, intermittently-connected links. Leveraging\nDelay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) and optical low-Earth-orbit (LEO)\nmesh constellations, we propose an architecture for header-first replication,\nlong-horizon Lightning channels with planetary watchtowers, and secure\nsettlement through federated sidechains or blind-merge-mined (BMM) commit\nchains. We formalize PoTT, analyze its security model, and show how it\nmeasurably improves reliability and accountability without altering Bitcoin\nconsensus or its monetary base.

Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local\nperformance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC\naddresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes\nin network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for\nachieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental\ntheoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural\nnetwork approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends\nrespectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the\ndistribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a\nnovel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions\nfrom the perspective of variation.

If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively\nevades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI\nsafety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human\nintervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI\nwith extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee\nsecurity. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework\nthat shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced\nstructural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are\ncomputationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined\nthreat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework\nis composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,\nand general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a\ngovernable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection\nagainst compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules\nand the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable\ntechnical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line\ndefined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,\ntamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack\nvectors.

In cybersecurity, researchers have primarily explored their use in\nred-team operations such as vulnerability discovery and penetration tests.\nDefensive uses for incident response and forensics have received comparatively\nless attention and remain at an early stage. This work presents a systematic\nstudy of LLM-agent design for the forensic investigation of realistic web\napplication attacks. We propose CyberSleuth, an autonomous agent that processes\npacket-level traces and application logs to identify the targeted service, the\nexploited vulnerability (CVE), and attack success. We evaluate the consequences\nof core design decisions - spanning tool integration and agent architecture -\nand provide interpretable guidance for practitioners. We benchmark four agent\narchitectures and six LLM backends on 20 incident scenarios of increasing\ncomplexity, identifying CyberSleuth as the best-performing design. In a\nseparate set of 10 incidents from 2025, CyberSleuth correctly identifies the\nexact CVE in 80% of cases. At last, we conduct a human study with 22 experts,\nwhich rated the reports of CyberSleuth as complete, useful, and coherent. They\nalso expressed a slight preference for DeepSeek R1, a good news for open source\nLLM. To foster progress in defensive LLM research, we release both our\nbenchmark and the CyberSleuth platform as a foundation for fair, reproducible\nevaluation of forensic agents.", "AI": {"tldr":

A key challenge in\nper-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling\nfactors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.\nExisting methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or\ngrid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm\nthat eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel\nPTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the\noptimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar\nquantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with\nminimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large\ncalibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon\nachieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making\nit a practical solution for efficient model deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Beacon\uc740 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub294 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\uc220\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Beacon\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ube44\ud655\ub300 \uc54c\ud30c\ubcb3\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucc44\ub110\ubcc4 PTQ\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \ub300\uce6d \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \uc591\uc790\ud654\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ud329\ud130\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Beacon\uc740 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc218\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uce6d\uc801 \ubc0f \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc801 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, \uc5ed\uc804\ud30c\ub098 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uce98\ub9ac\ube0c\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Beacon\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\uc131\uacfc \ud29c\ub2dd \uc5c6\ub294 \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc591\uc790\ud654\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\uc220\uc774\ub2e4. \ucc44\ub110\ubcc4 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc591\uc790\ud654(PTQ)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uac12\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc\uc758 \uac12\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ud329\ud130\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc870\uc815 \ub610\ub294 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc744 \uace0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub178\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc218\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 Beacon\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

On the 104-challenge\nXBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performance\non SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on broken\nauthorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-side\ntemplate injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%)\nand blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive cost\nanalysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 for\nsuccessful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates strongly\nwith resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds at\napproximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge.\n  MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of the\nrespective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low average\noperating cost of $3.67 per open-source assessment: MAPTA discovered critical\nvulnerabilities including RCEs, command injections, secret exposure, and\narbitrary file write vulnerabilities.

Contextual Markov Decision Processes\n(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit\ncontext variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts\nare latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination\n(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers\nlatent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training\na self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates\nactionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging\nperception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for\nefficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space\nenables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension\nalters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways.

To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,\neffectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth\ncurve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in\nassessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the\nefficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby\nsupporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 MMORPG\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \ub808\ubca8\ub9c1 \ubd07\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub808\ubca8\uc5c5 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MMORPG\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\ub3d9 \ub808\ubca8\ub9c1 \ubd07\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uacfc \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uce58\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc744 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ubcf4\uc870 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubd07 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uba70, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 MMORPG\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd07 \uaddc\uc81c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\uac8c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub864\ud50c\ub808\uc789 \uac8c\uc784(MMORPG)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\ub3d9 \ub808\ubca8\ub9c1 \ubd07\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\ub97c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \ub808\ubca8\uc5c5 \uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uacfc \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd07\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubc95\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacbd\ud5d8 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ub2f9\uc131\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\ube44 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub808\ubca8\uc5c5 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \ub808\ubca8\ub9c1 \ubd07 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ubcf4\uc870 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ub41c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ucc28\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c LLM\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc7ac\uc790\uac00 \ub808\ubca8\ub9c1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc131\uc7a5 \uace1\uc120 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud611\uc5c5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd07 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec MMORPG\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \ubd07 \uaddc\uc81c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an\neffective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model\nweights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich\nsemantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in\nstandalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)\nremains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model\ncapacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to\nfine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse\nintervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a\nlightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge\ndevices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to\naggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging\ncan corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me\n(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others\nand partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by\nbalancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense\nreasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x\nhigher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uc740\ub2c9 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, PEFT \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "PEFT \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6a9\ub7c9 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "FedReFT\ub294 \uc2a4\ud398\uc5b4\uc2a4 \uac1c\uc785 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc740\ub2c9 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc870\uc791\ud558\uba70, All-But-Me (ABM) \uc9d1\ud569 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FedReFT\ub294 \uc0c1\uc2dd \ucd94\ub860, \uc0b0\uc220 \ucd94\ub860, \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f GLUE\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 PEFT \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 7\ubc30\uc5d0\uc11c 15\ubc30 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FedReFT\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815(PEFT)\uc740 \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT)\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we investigate the potential for\nhidden prompt injection attacks, where authors embed adversarial text within a\npaper's PDF to influence the LLM-generated review. We begin by formalising\nthree distinct threat models that envision attackers with different motivations\n-- not all of which implying malicious intent. For each threat model, we design\nadversarial prompts that remain invisible to human readers yet can steer an\nLLM's output toward the author's desired outcome. Using a user study with\ndomain scholars, we derive four representative reviewing prompts used to elicit\npeer reviews from LLMs. We then evaluate the robustness of our adversarial\nprompts across (i) different reviewing prompts, (ii) different commercial\nLLM-based systems, and (iii) different peer-reviewed papers. Our results show\nthat adversarial prompts can reliably mislead the LLM, sometimes in ways that\nadversely affect a \"honest-but-lazy\" reviewer.

At the core\nof ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large\nscale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,\nautonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these\nchallenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies\nthat balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper\npresents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a\nstructured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination\nmodels and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor\ncritic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across\nkey ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous\nvehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.\nFurthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,\nand CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.\nThe survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non\nstationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real\ntransfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)\uc5d0\uc11c Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, MARL \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uc774\ub3d9\uc131\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)\ub97c \ud604\ub300 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ud601\uc2e0\uc758 \ucd5c\uc804\uc120\uc5d0 \uc704\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MARL \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18, \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ubc18, \uc561\ud130 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uac15\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub17c\ubb38\uc740 ITS\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uba70, SUMO, CARLA, CityFlow\uc640 \uac19\uc740 MARL \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, Emerging benchmarks\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub610\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131, \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ubd80\uc5ec, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uc804\uc774\ub97c \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uc774\ub3d9\uc131\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(ITS)\uc744 \ud604\ub300 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ud601\uc2e0\uc758 \ucd5c\uc804\uc120\uc5d0 \uc704\uce58\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that\nmodels two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:\nWHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural\ncharacteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are\nrepresented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our\nproposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion\nstrategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on\nHit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high\ninterpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for\ndifferent job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)\ndata for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach\nfor 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and\ncomprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of\ncandidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution\nlies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between\ntask alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for\nemployees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical\nimplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub0b4\ubd80 \uc778\uc7ac \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4

In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving\nrepresentative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,\nincorporating a \"rewriting-resolution-review-revision\" logical chain via three\nreasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,\nrespectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The\nConsultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link\nproblems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem\ndescriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible\nfor generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem\nresolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for\nself-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code\nruntime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable\ncode provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive\nevaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in\nsolving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis\nproblems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly\nimproves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of\nnon-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for\nautonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review\nmechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN\nsolutions) rate of the latest reasoning models.

However, their\nflexibility also introduces new attack vectors-particularly Prompt Injection\n(PI), where adversaries manipulate model behavior through crafted inputs. As\nattackers continuously evolve with paraphrased, obfuscated, and even multi-task\ninjection strategies, existing benchmarks are no longer sufficient to capture\nthe full spectrum of emerging threats.\n  To address this gap, we construct a new benchmark that systematically extends\nprior efforts. Our benchmark subsumes the two widely-used existing ones while\nintroducing new manipulation techniques and multi-task scenarios, thereby\nproviding a more comprehensive evaluation setting. We find that existing\ndefenses, though effective on their original benchmarks, show clear weaknesses\nunder our benchmark, underscoring the need for more robust solutions. Our key\ninsight is that while attack forms may vary, the adversary's intent-injecting\nan unauthorized task-remains invariant. Building on this observation, we\npropose PromptSleuth, a semantic-oriented defense framework that detects prompt\ninjection by reasoning over task-level intent rather than surface features.\nEvaluated across state-of-the-art benchmarks, PromptSleuth consistently\noutperforms existing defense while maintaining comparable runtime and cost\nefficiency. These results demonstrate that intent-based semantic reasoning\noffers a robust, efficient, and generalizable strategy for defending LLMs\nagainst evolving prompt injection threats.", "AI": {"tldr":

The vector quantization process creates discrete code\nassignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We\nevaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the\nunsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively\ndifferentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we\nfine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the\nvariables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across\nmultiple problem type distributions.

Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations\ncharacterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and\nvarying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and\nconvergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional\ntimetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key\ninnovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by\naugmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station\nID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,\nvelocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to\ncapture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs\ninto a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function\naligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway\ndeviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule\nadherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves\nmore stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,\n-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that\nsingle-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and\nschedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,\nreal-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to\nMARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubc84\uc2a4 \uad70\uc9d1\ud654

To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of\napplications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as\nmiddleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from\npotentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while\nmaintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation\nstrategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications.\nTo address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an\nautomated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation\nboundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended\ngoals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information\nleakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose\nsignificant security risks.

In\nthis paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to\nimplant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's\nresponsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive\nAlignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment\nmechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the\nadversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced\nthrough overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to\ninject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning\ndefenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation\ntechniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate\nthe practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on\nLLM-powered application pipelines.

We transformed the WHO\nIMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,\ntreatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal\nto generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual\ndistractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables\nsystematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\\% accuracy), and we find\nmodels excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,\ntreatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks\ncan identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.\nBeyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training\n(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward\nsamples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach\nsuccessfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.\nThis methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution\nfor creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,\nincluding when the guidelines are updated.

We build an open, fully\ndocumented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit\nregional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further\nT_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the\nuser and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved\nbaseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a\nnon-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.\n  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants\nand four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and\nwithin-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently\ndemonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios\ninvolving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants\ndramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far\nmore robust.\n  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is\nunreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a\n'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary\nbusiness challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the\nspecific DML model

This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate\nbalance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing\nfor patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We\npropose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital\nunit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our\nmodel incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven\ndemand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining\nobjective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,\nthe GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,\nnon-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical\nhospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced\nschedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\\%\nperformance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual\nscheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between\ncritical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical\ndecision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.",

Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling\ncontinuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals\nfor machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The\ncurrent naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited\nbiological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.\nWe investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine\nlearning EEG analysis.\n  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that\ncreates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG\ndata and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that\ntypically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable\nsynthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG\nmethod has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying\nit to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG\nwith fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG\nmachine learning pipeline for seizure detection.\n  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure\ndetection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using\na standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and\nrequires fewer segments.\n  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG\ncan be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to\nimprove performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation\nfor signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard\npreprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.",

By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the\ntraining loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact\ninference gives access to maximum accuracy.\n  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve\nNP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku\nbenchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a\nfraction of training time of other hybrid methods.

One example is the incremental learning phenomenon\nin gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem\nwith small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning\nits singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,\nwe develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior\nfor GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form\nsolution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation.

However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and\nrelevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,\nwhich significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream\ngeneration tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,\na novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and\nconstruct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval\nacross heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by\nleveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley\nvalue-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent\nrecognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to\ntrain an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling\nfine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across\nknowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS\noutperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification\naccuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream

This\npaper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal\nmachine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of\nthe same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML\narchitecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by\nreducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed\narchitecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while\nmaintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.\nThe study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data\nmodalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new\nframe geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for\nprediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize\nto unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in\nsupplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the\nconceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between\nmachine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves\nthe way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering\ndesign, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural\ndevelopment and accelerate the design cycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub514\uc790\uc774\ub108\uac00 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ud6c4\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc124\uacc4\uc790\uac00 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub4e4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(MMML) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "MMML \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc811\uadfc\ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MMML\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc18 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc95\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub514\uc790\uc774\ub108\uac00 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ud6c4\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc788\ub294\uac00? \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(MMML) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c MMML \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\ub3c4\ub97c \uc904\uc5ec \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc124\uacc4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc124\uacc4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\ub150 \uc124\uacc4 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube60\ub978 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 MMML\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c MMML \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 MMML\uc774 \ud2b9\ud788 \uac1c\ub150 \uc124\uacc4 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc18 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc881\ud788\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uacc4 \uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc138\ub828\ub418\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Airbnb has historically\nrelied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests\ndue to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from\nextracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of\nrepresentation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has\nbecome easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text\ndocuments and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between\nlistings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.\n  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,\nvarious unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,\nmaking this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to\ncombine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a\nsingle representation.\n  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text\nand photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained\nlanguage-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable\ncharacteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per\nlisting and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory\nefficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and\nenabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.\n  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in\nthe Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,\nachieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental\nrevenue.", "AI": {"tldr": "BiListing\uc740 Airbnb \ubaa9\ub85d\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ubaa9\ub85d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Airbnb\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "BiListing \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ub85d\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 BiListing \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 Airbnb \uac80\uc0c9 \uc21c\uc704 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubc0f \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uc5ec 0.425% NDCB \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\ubc31\ub9cc \ub2ec\ub7ec\uc758 \ucd94\uac00 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ucc3d\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc5b4\ube44\uc564\ube44\ub294 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc219\ubc15 \uc81c\uacf5\uc758 \uc120\ub450\uc8fc\uc790\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc5b4\ube44\uc564\ube44\ub294 \uacfc\uac70\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac8c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ubaa9\ub85d\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ub9e4\uae30\uba70, \ucd94\ucc9c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub530\ub978 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub4f1\uc7a5\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc0ac\uc9c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc5b4\ube44\uc564\ube44 \ubaa9\ub85d\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc81c\ubaa9, \uc124\uba85, \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ube44\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubb38\uc11c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 BiListing, \uc989 \uc774\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa9\ub85d\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ub85d\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a\nnovel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based\nencoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid\ntime-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture\nlocal morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are\ncritical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance\ndenoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly\noptimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in\nthe frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively\nsuppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the\nsignal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform\ncomponents. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals\nfrom the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database\n(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate\nconsistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error\nmetrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation\ncoefficient of 0.9540.

This\npaper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the\ntopological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear\nattention architecture-\\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection\npatterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact\nattention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full\nhistorical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent\nbetween existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a\nseries of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer\nagainst a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The\nresults demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key\nmetrics such as \\textbf{inference latency}, \\textbf{KV cache efficiency},\n\\textbf{memory footprint}, and \\textbf{overall speedup}.", "AI": {"tldr": "TLinFormer\ub294 Transformer \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc548\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c, \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Transformer \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uae38\uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc81c\uacf1\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc8fc\uc758\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub85c \ub3cc\uc544\uac00 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud750\ub984\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc5ec TLinFormer\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "TLinFormer\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc8fc\uc758 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc804\uccb4 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc778\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 TLinFormer\ub294 \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 Transformer\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Transformer \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ud575\uc2ec \uc790\uccb4 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uae38\uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc81c\uacf1\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub824 \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ucee4\ub110 \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\ub098 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc778 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc8fc\uc758\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub85c \ub3cc\uc544\uac00 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 TLinFormer\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

When working\nwith high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach\nto learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general\nautoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a\nlatent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the\noriginal observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold\nrepresentation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type\nof geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural\nnetworks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization\nprocedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new\nscalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of\nthe amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into\nthe original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows\nthe computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold.

Despite this known\nlimitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate\ninformation that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.\nUnderstanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of\nthese models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about\nhow users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work\naddresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods\nwith Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and\ninterpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four\ndistinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series\nspecific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base\nmodels) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,\ntransportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that\nfeature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform\nfoundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,\ncar parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation\nmodels excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AI(XAI) \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ud3c9\uc810 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uba85(RDE)\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378(TSFM)\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uacfc \uc2e4\ud328 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AI \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ud3c9\uc810 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec ARIMA, \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubd80\uc2a4\ud305, Chronos, Llama\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378(\uc608: \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubd80\uc2a4\ud305)\uc740 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uac70\ub098 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(\uc608: Chronos)\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ucd94\uc138 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378(TSFM)\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud574 \uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc720\uc640 \uc2dc\uae30\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131, \uc131\ub2a5 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \ubc0f \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc758\uc874\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac00\uce58 \uc788\ub294 \ub178\ub825\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AI(XAI) \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ud3c9\uc810 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uba85(RDE)\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c TSFM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae08\uc735, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0, \uc6b4\uc1a1 \ubc0f \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \ud310\ub9e4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c ARIMA, \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubd80\uc2a4\ud305, Chronos(\uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc804\uc6a9 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378), Llama(\ubc94\uc6a9;

Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,\ndata owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine\nunlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific\ndata without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound\nforgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving\nresidual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of\ndegraded utility.\n  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss\nReweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses\nthese limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness\nguided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by\nmeasuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling\nmore targeted and effective unlearning.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated\neffectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.\nHowever, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on\npairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in\nclinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits\nrepresentation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel\nStructure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold\nideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order\ninteractions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture\nto reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function\nincorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original\nstructure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nSHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 HyperGraph Transformer \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "motivation": "EHR\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ud559 \ucf54\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GNN \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \uc778\ucf54\ub354, \uc804\uccb4 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 Transformer \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ud1b5\ud569, \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218 \uc124\uacc4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c SHGT\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "SHGT \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHR)\uc740 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud658\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc740 EHR \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ub8cc \ucf54\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 GNN \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc774\uc720\ub85c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: a) \uc30d \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, b) \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud654\ub41c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\ub2ec \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud45c\ud604 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \ub530\ub974\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad6c\uc870 \uc778\uc2dd \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(SHGT) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: a) \uc758\ub8cc \ucf54\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \uc778\ucf54\ub354 \uc0ac\uc6a9, b) \uc804\uccb4 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ud1b5\ud569, c) \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uc6d0\ub798 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218 \uc124\uacc4. \uc2e4\uc81c EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c SHGT\uac00 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784."}}

Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on\nunseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising\nalternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this\ndata-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward\nLearning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a\nself-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a\nreward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,\nmulti-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT\nand RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data\nalready surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.\nCrucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and\ncross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based\nmethods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves\nperformance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more\nparameters.

Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation\nduring language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck\nin attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While\nthe LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still\nface this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are\nless effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.\nFurthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks\nrelationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm\nto calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more\neffectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to\nprovide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.\nExtensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2\nmodels demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the\ntraining of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance\ndegradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.\nThis work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and\nfiner-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training.

Bayta\u015f"], "title": "Local Virtual Nodes for Alleviating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks", "comment": null, "summary": "Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks\ninvolving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field\nshould be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,\ngathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its\ncontent into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable\nto bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied\nremedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate\nover-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global\ntopology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph\nstructure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This\nstudy presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate\nthe effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global\nstructure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the\nnode centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,\nthe proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with\nlikely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across\nselected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without\nadding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve\nperformance on graph and node classification tasks.

Generally,\nthis problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional\ndistributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows\nexponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data\nanalysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across\ndifferent underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based\napproach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we\nintroduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of\ncredibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey\ndata in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our\nalgorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the\nfact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data\nrather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we\nshow that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the\nregression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality\nof the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and\nnumerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud45c\ubcf8 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\uac00

Although MAEs have\ndemonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their\nuse for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely\nunexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as\nnon-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where\nlabeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We\npropose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic\nultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that\nenhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)\nclassification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model\nsize, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream\naccuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform\nmodels trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbaselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on\nsynthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured\nsignals compared with training solely on limited real datasets.

When equipped with tools through function\ncalling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based\nsystems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.\nHowever, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale\ngraph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this\ntechnical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph\nalgorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing\nof algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can\nbe used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any\nquestion that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning\nabout their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers.

This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid\nStochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid\nstochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,\nTV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes\nover time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation\nor out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic\ngradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking\nglobal descent directions.

Current EEG representation learning\nmethods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked\nreconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic\ninformation and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we\npropose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based\non the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a\nself-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong\nrepresentation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates\nan EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a\ncompact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the\ndiffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a\ncompact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative\nprocess but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks.

Most existing approaches train the student model using a\ndiffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score\nfunction, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is\nimperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to\nsub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced\n/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased\ngradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation.

We show that the number of facts a model can memorize\nsolely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In\ncontrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple\nand efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled\nexperiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.\nWe further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use\nand general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory.

Inspired by iterative methods in\nsolving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific\nneural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we\nprogressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving\nthe model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an\nadaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is\ngradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling\nlaw with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our\nadaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a\nchallenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where\na multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex\nwave phenomena.

We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series\nas a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven\nprocedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of\nthis process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests\noriginating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the\nsimilarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time\nseries distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series\nforecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in\nspecific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance\nachieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to\ntraining on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models\non compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on\noriginal test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation.

While most prior studies assume\nthat attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we\nsystematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries\nto more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task\nassistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging\nthreat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically\ntargeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation\non which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,\nRL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the\nmodel toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through\nentropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the\nescalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across\nmultiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates\nharmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.\nOur results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater\nsystemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general\ndefense.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815(SFT)\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud070 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\uc220\uc778 TokenBuncher\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc720\ud574\ud55c \uc545\uc6a9 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "TokenBuncher\ub294 RL \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud0c0\uac9f\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub97c \ubc29\uc5b4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c TokenBuncher\ub294 \uc720\ud574\ud55c RL \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RL \uae30\ubc18 \uc720\ud574 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 SFT\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud070 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uba70, TokenBuncher\uac00 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc720\ud574\ud55c \uc545\uc6a9\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\ub3c4 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \uc545\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815(SFT)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc790\uac00 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae68\ub728\ub9ac\uace0 \uace0\uae09 \uc720\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RL \uae30\ubc18 \uc720\ud574 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc778 TokenBuncher\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Project page:\n  https://sites.google.com/view/ditree", "summary": "Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free\ntrajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical\nproblem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the\nrobot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action\npropagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and\nsolution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due\nto uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield\nsignificantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,\nthus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree\n(DiTree): a \\emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion\npolicies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search\nwithin SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of\nexpert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness\nof SBPs to yield \\emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation\niterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an\nimplementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler\ntrained on a \\emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD\nscenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than\nclassical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.\nDiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other\napproaches by achieving roughly 30\\% higher success rate.

However, aligning their output\ndistributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,\ncompositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While\nreinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to\nthese generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion\nmodels and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after\nfine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models\nthrough the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward\nconditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an\ninference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining\nthe outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically\nequivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL\nobjectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off\nwithout further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG\nconsistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various\narchitectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human\npreferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.\nFurthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby\noffering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our\napproach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing\nand controlling diffusion model alignment at inference.

Recent state-of-the-art\napproaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,\nconverting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these\nmethods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high\ncomputational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that\naccomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:\ntransformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and\nautoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves\ntwo primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and\n(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by\nconstructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework\nreduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental\nresults on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or\nexceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational\nefficiency.

Recent\ngraph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,\nbut they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal\nmotifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as\nthey unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when\nfraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both\nsignals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages\ntemporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor\ncondenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,\npreserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed\nby dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single\nmotif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step\nfraud schemes.

However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions\nresults in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer\nauthentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel\ncharacteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel\nvariations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based\nphysical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile\nscenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation\nusing IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated\nbased on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance\ncorrelation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of\nmanually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial\ncorrelation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their\nsimilarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and\nexperimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT\ndevelopment kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered.

These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to\nvariations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we\nintroduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic\nconfigurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the\nMaterials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data\nrepresentation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations\nacross widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It\nsignificantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.\nLeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force\nstructures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By\nfine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a\nsignificant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also\npresent LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library\ndeveloped for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the\ncommunity to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued\nevolution of large-scale materials datasets.

One of the key challenges in\ndesigning graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that\ncan vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been\nfocused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling\narbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.\nHowever, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in\nthe field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the\nrecent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a\nsimple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.\nSpecifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood\nfeature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to\nthe constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our\nmodel achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available\nGFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,\nafter finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the\npotential of the proposed approach.

Our framework applies to settings\nsuch as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and\nworkforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.\nAgents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or\nrecovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge\ncenters on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing\nintervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key\ncompeting objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future\ndecisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution\nintroduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards\nin the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature.

InSQuAD achieves\nthis through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a\ntargeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on\nSMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the\nnotions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in\nexisting retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking\ndiversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training\nparadigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality\nand diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To\nfurther aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question\nanswering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases.

We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of\nSNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization\nproblems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and\nquadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard\nlinear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized\nKaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized\nKaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under\nmild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first\nconvergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that\nSPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic\nloss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a\nfast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first\nexplanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.\nOverall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can\nshed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware\noptimization strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "SNGD\uc640 SPRING\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 SNGD\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 SPRING\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SNGD\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc124\uba85 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ubaa9\uc801.", "method": "\uc774\uc0c1\ud654\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 SNGD\uc640 SPRING\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud55c \ubcfc\ub85d\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc120\ud615 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c.", "result": "SNGD\uc640 SPRING \uac01\uac01\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \ubcf4\uc7a5, SNGD\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud558\ub294 SPRING\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uc120\ud615 \ub300\uc218 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc11c\ube0c\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \uace1\ub960 \uc778\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc870\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc11c\ube0c\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \uc790\uc5f0 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ud558\uac15(SNGD)\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud30c\ub3d9 \ud568\uc218 \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud588\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc120\ud615\uc774\uace0 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \ubcfc\ub85d\ud558\uba70 \uc774\ucc28\uc778 \uc774\uc0c1\ud654\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 SNGD\uc640 \uadf8 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub41c \ubcc0\ud615\uc778 SPRING\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc18c \uc81c\uacf1 \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc989 \ud45c\uc900 \uc120\ud615 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc81c\uacf1 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 SNGD\uac00 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uce74\uce20\ub9c8\ub974\uce20 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uba70 SPRING\uc774 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uce74\uce20\ub9c8\ub974\uce20 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uae30\uc874 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec (i) SNGD\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4, (ii) \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c SPRING\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 (iii) SPRING\uc774 SNGD\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud55c \ubcfc\ub85d \uc774\ucc28 \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uce74\uce20\ub9c8\ub974\uce20 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec SNGD\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bb\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uc18c \uc81c\uacf1 \uc124\uc815 \uc678\uc5d0\uc11c SNGD\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uc120\ud615 \ub300\uc218 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uc11c\ube0c\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \uace1\ub960 \uc778\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1d\ud790 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}
