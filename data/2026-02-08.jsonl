We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs."}

Modern image generation models produce photorealistic images undermining the evidentiary foundation upon which journalism and public discourse depend. Existing authentication approaches, such as the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), embed cryptographically signed metadata directly into image files but suffer from two critical failures: technical vulnerability to metadata stripping during social media reprocessing, and structural dependency on corporate-controlled verification infrastructure where commercial incentives may conflict with public interest. We present the Birthmark Standard, an authentication architecture leveraging manufacturing-unique sensor entropy from non-uniformity correction (NUC) maps and PRNU patterns to generate hardware-rooted authentication keys. During capture, cameras create anonymized authentication certificates proving sensor authenticity without exposing device identity via a key table architecture maintaining anonymity sets exceeding 1,000 devices. Authentication records are stored on a consortium blockchain operated by journalism organizations rather than commercial platforms, enabling verification that survives all metadata loss. We formally verify privacy properties using ProVerif, proving observational equivalence for Manufacturer Non-Correlation and Blockchain Observer Non-Identification under Dolev-Yao adversary assumptions. The architecture is validated through prototype implementation using Raspberry Pi 4 hardware, demonstrating the complete cryptographic pipeline. Performance analysis projects camera overhead below 100ms and verification latency below 500ms at scale of one million daily authentications."}

Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions, the transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than the MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines. These results support diffusion-based normative modeling as a practical route to calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging."}

Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates."}

Critically, this technology is no longer confined to large-scale labs; the proliferation of efficient, open-source generators is democratizing the ability to create high-fidelity synthetic content on consumer-grade hardware. This makes existing face-centric and manipulation-based benchmarks obsolete. To address this urgent threat, we introduce SynthForensics, to the best of our knowledge the first human-centric benchmark for detecting purely synthetic video deepfakes. The benchmark comprises 6,815 unique videos from five architecturally distinct, state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. Its construction was underpinned by a meticulous two-stage, human-in-the-loop validation to ensure high semantic and visual quality. Each video is provided in four versions (raw, lossless, light, and heavy compression) to enable real-world robustness testing. Experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art detectors are both fragile and exhibit limited generalization when evaluated on this new domain: we observe a mean performance drop of $29.19\\%$ AUC, with some methods performing worse than random chance, and top models losing over 30 points under heavy compression. The paper further investigates the efficacy of training on SynthForensics as a means to mitigate these observed performance gaps, achieving robust generalization to unseen generators ($93.81\\%$ AUC), though at the cost of reduced backward compatibility with traditional manipulation-based deepfakes. The complete dataset and all generation metadata, including the specific prompts and inference parameters for every video, will be made publicly available at [link anonymized for review]."}

We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting \"interactivity\" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems."}

This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes."}

Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality.

Supervised by Prof. Jun Pang and Dr. Eloi Durant", "summary": "Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are fundamental to evidence-based research, but manual screening is an increasing bottleneck as scientific output grows. Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies."}

Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search.

We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain."}

Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings.

Code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/EUQ", "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \\emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

We explore if having explicit multiplicative interactions as an architectural inductive bias helps in structural disentanglement, through Bilinear MLPs. We show analytically that bilinear parameterizations possess a `non-mixing' property under gradient flow conditions, where functional components separate into orthogonal subspace representations. This provides a mathematical foundation for surgical model modification. We validate this hypothesis through a series of controlled experiments spanning modular arithmetic, cyclic reasoning, Lie group dynamics, and targeted unlearning benchmarks. Unlike pointwise nonlinear networks, multiplicative architectures are able to recover true operators aligned with the underlying algebraic structure. Our results suggest that model editability and generalization are constrained by representational structure, and that architectural inductive bias plays a central role in enabling reliable unlearning."}

Theoretical analysis of behavioral alignment evaluation", "summary": "Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.\n  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.\n  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.\n  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions.

Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases."}

To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility. We provide theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrate how our methods reduce this risk.

A lot of research has been done in leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. However, the resulting models are either not accurate enough or are still vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) or dataset reconstruction attacks since the original data has been leveraged in the training process. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of producing a synthetic test dataset with the same statistical properties as the original one, with only indirectly leveraging the original data in the generation process. The approach is inspired by GANs, with a generation step and a discrimination step. However, in our approach, we use a test generator (a fuzzer) to produce test data from an input specification, preserving constraints set by the original data; a discriminator model determines how close we are to the original data. By evolving samples and determining \"good samples\" with the discriminator, we can generate privacy-preserving data that follows the same statistical distributions are the original dataset, leading to a similar utility as the original data. We evaluated our approach on four datasets that have been used to evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques.

However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks."}

These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity."}

This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics.

In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies."}

Accepted to AI4TS Workshop @ AAAI'26 as an oral presentation (see https://ai4ts.github.io/aaai2026)", "summary": "Time-series foundation models have emerged as a new paradigm for forecasting, yet their ability to effectively leverage exogenous features -- critical for electricity demand forecasting -- remains unclear. This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain."}

Theoretical analysis of behavioral alignment evaluation", "summary": "Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.\n  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.\n  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.\n  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment."}

Here, we quantify how depth affects loss via analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks. We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics. This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. The findings suggest that improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth."}

Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\\% accuracy improvements and 49\\% ECE improvements. Our results support the hypothesis that distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL thus provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference."}
