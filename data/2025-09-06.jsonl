If artificial general\nintelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,\nproblem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will\nincreasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise\na natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,\na successor \"digital species\", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of\nthe universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked\ndifferentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central\nnervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical\nreality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,\njoy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of\nour actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the\nconsequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop\nsustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the\nuniverse. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a\nbiological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be\nsufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more\ncapable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,\nthe best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not\nsilicon."}

However,\nexisting LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such\nnegotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses\nthat make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by\nadversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an\nevolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional\nexpression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a\nMarkov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to\nevolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We\nfurther propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla\nstrategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware\nnegotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo\nconsistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher\nefficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance\nof adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for\nmulti-turn negotiation."}

However, their potential is often limited by the\nfinite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To\ndevelop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale\nin complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we\nreframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a\ngoal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a\ngenerative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize\nincreasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**\nagents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,\ngoal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,\nconfigurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'\nweaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative\npolicy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates\na self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to\nchallenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively\ninfinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that\nthis framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world\nmodel learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders\nlearning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics.

We present a\ngame-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning\nnetworks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and\naccuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by\ndecomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the\nlocal utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global\nutility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the\nCPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time\nto an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability\ncriteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring\nnodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within\ncommunities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these\nobjectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community\ntracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden\nalgorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that\nrobust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities."}
