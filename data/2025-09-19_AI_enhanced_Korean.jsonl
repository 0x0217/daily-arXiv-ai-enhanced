Applying DP requires making several\nimplementation decisions, each with significant impacts on data privacy and/or\nutility. Hence, to promote shared learning and accountability around DP\ndeployments, Dwork, Kohli, and Mulligan (2019) proposed a public-facing\nrepository (\"registry\") of DP deployments. The DP community has recently\nstarted to work toward realizing this vision. We contribute to this effort by\n(1) developing a holistic, hierarchical schema to describe any given DP\ndeployment and (2) designing and implementing an interactive interface to act\nas a registry where practitioners can access information about past DP\ndeployments. We (3) populate our interface with 21 real-world DP deployments\nand (4) conduct an exploratory user study with DP practitioners ($n=16$) to\nunderstand how they would use the registry, as well as what challenges and\nopportunities they foresee around its adoption. We find that participants were\nenthusiastic about the registry as a valuable resource for evaluating prior\ndeployments and making future deployments. They also identified several\nopportunities for the registry, including that it can become a \"hub\" for the\ncommunity and support broader communication around DP (e.g., to legal teams).\nAt the same time, they identified challenges around the registry gaining\nadoption, including the effort and risk involved with making implementation\nchoices public and moderating the quality of entries. Based on our findings, we\noffer recommendations for encouraging adoption and increasing the registry's\nvalue not only to DP practitioners, but also to policymakers, data users, and\ndata subjects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc(DP) \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacf5\uac1c \ub9ac\ud3ec\uc9c0\ud1a0\ub9ac \uad6c\ucd95\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\ud300\uc740 DP \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, DP \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9 \ubc29\uc548\uacfc \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc758 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Dwork, Kohli, Mulligan(2019)\uc740 DP \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uac1c \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "DP \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uacfc\uac70 DP \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "21\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c DP \ubc30\ud3ec \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ucc44\uc6b0\uace0, DP \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub808\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac \ud65c\uc6a9 \ubc29\uc548\uacfc \uc9c1\uba74\ud560 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \ub808\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \uacfc\uac70 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc218\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uac8c \uc5ec\uacbc\uace0, DP \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc640\uc758 \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \uc18c\ud1b5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uad6c\ud604 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ub178\ub825\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8, \ud56d\ubaa9 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubaa8\ub354\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ub09c\uc81c\uac00 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc(DP)\ub294 \uae30\ucd08 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ub41c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc81c\ud488\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc9c0\ub09c 10\ub144\uac04 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544\uc654\ub2e4.

OAuth 2.0 assumes deterministic clients, but in agentic settings\nstochastic reasoning, prompt injection, or multi-agent orchestration can\nsilently expand privileges.\n  We introduce Agentic JWT (A-JWT), a dual-faceted intent token that binds each\nagent's action to verifiable user intent and, optionally, to a specific\nworkflow step. A-JWT carries an agent's identity as a one-way checksum hash\nderived from its prompt, tools and configuration, and a chained delegation\nassertion to prove which downstream agent may execute a given task, and\nper-agent proof-of-possession keys to prevent replay and in-process\nimpersonation. We define a new authorization mechanism and add a lightweight\nclient shim library that self-verifies code at run time, mints intent tokens,\ntracks workflow steps and derives keys, thus enabling secure agent identity and\nseparation even within a single process.\n  We illustrate a comprehensive threat model for agentic applications,\nimplement a Python proof-of-concept and show functional blocking of\nscope-violating requests, replay, impersonation, and prompt-injection pathways\nwith sub-millisecond overhead on commodity hardware. The design aligns with\nongoing OAuth agent discussions and offers a drop-in path toward zero-trust\nguarantees for agentic applications.

This report presents a comprehensive security assessment of\na production humanoid robot platform, bridging the gap between abstract\nsecurity models and operational vulnerabilities. Through systematic static\nanalysis, runtime observation, and cryptographic examination, we uncovered a\ncomplex security landscape characterized by both sophisticated defensive\nmechanisms and critical vulnerabilities. Our findings reveal a dual-layer\nproprietary encryption system (designated FMX') that, while innovative in\ndesign, suffers from fundamental implementation flaws including the use of\nstatic cryptographic keys that enable offline configuration decryption. More\nsignificantly, we documented persistent telemetry connections transmitting\ndetailed robot state information--including audio, visual, spatial, and\nactuator data--to external servers without explicit user consent or\nnotification mechanisms. We operationalized a Cybersecurity AI agent on the\nUnitree G1 to map and prepare exploitation of its manufacturer's cloud\ninfrastructure, illustrating how a compromised humanoid can escalate from\ncovert data collection to active counter-offensive operations. We argue that\nsecuring humanoid robots requires a paradigm shift toward Cybersecurity AI\n(CAI) frameworks that can adapt to the unique challenges of physical-cyber\nconvergence. This work contributes empirical evidence for developing robust\nsecurity standards as humanoid robots transition from research curiosities to\noperational systems in critical domains.", "AI": {"tldr":

Lessons from COVID-19 Agent-Based Models: A Systematic Review", "comment": "20 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, 8 supplemental files", "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a surge in computational models to simulate\ndisease dynamics and guide interventions. Agent-based models (ABMs) are\nwell-suited to capture population and environmental heterogeneity, but their\nrapid deployment raised questions about utility for health policy. We\nsystematically reviewed 536 COVID-19 ABM studies published from January 2020 to\nDecember 2023, retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed, and Wiley on January 30,\n2024. Studies were included if they used ABMs to simulate COVID-19\ntransmission, where reviews were excluded. Studies were assessed against nine\ncriteria of model usefulness, including transparency and re-use,\ninterdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and evaluation\npractices. Publications peaked in late 2021 and were concentrated in a few\ncountries. Most models explored behavioral or policy interventions (n = 294,\n54.85%) rather than real-time forecasting (n = 9, 1.68%). While most described\nmodel assumptions (n = 491, 91.60%), fewer disclosed limitations (n = 349,\n65.11%), shared code (n = 219, 40.86%), or built on existing models (n = 195,\n36.38%). Standardized reporting protocols (n = 36, 6.72%) and stakeholder\nengagement were rare (13.62%, n = 73). Only 2.24% (n = 12) described a\ncomprehensive validation framework, though uncertainty was often quantified (n\n= 407, 75.93%). Limitations of this review include underrepresentation of\nnon-English studies, subjective data extraction, variability in study quality,\nand limited generalizability.

However, most existing approaches are limited in their ability to\ngeneralize solutions across varying non-parametric geometric domains. In this\nwork, we address this challenge in the context of Polyethylene Terephthalate\n(PET) bottle buckling analysis, a representative packaging design problem\nconventionally solved using computationally expensive finite element analysis\n(FEA). We introduce a hybrid DeepONet-Transolver framework that simultaneously\npredicts nodal displacement fields and the time evolution of reaction forces\nduring top load compression. Our methodology is evaluated on two families of\nbottle geometries parameterized by two and four design variables. Training data\nis generated using nonlinear FEA simulations in Abaqus for 254 unique designs\nper family. The proposed framework achieves mean relative $L^{2}$ errors of\n2.5-13% for displacement fields and approximately 2.4% for time-dependent\nreaction forces for the four-parameter bottle family. Point-wise error analyses\nfurther show absolute displacement errors on the order of $10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}$,\nwith the largest discrepancies confined to localized geometric regions.\nImportantly, the model accurately captures key physical phenomena, such as\nbuckling behavior, across diverse bottle geometries.

In this\ndemo, we define three core operations for interacting with multi-agent\nsimulations: inject, fork, and compare. Inject allows researchers to introduce\nexternal events at any point during simulation execution. Fork creates\nindependent timeline branches from any timestamp, preserving complete state\nwhile allowing divergent exploration. Compare facilitates parallel observation\nof multiple branches, revealing how different interventions lead to distinct\nemergent behaviors. Together, these operations establish a vocabulary that\ntransforms linear simulation workflows into interactive, explorable spaces. We\ndemonstrate this vocabulary through a commodity market simulation with fourteen\nAI agents, where researchers can inject contrasting events and observe\ndivergent outcomes across parallel timelines. By defining these fundamental\noperations, we provide a starting point for systematic causal investigation in\nLLM-based agent simulations, moving beyond passive observation toward active\nexperimentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uc5ec \"what if\" \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc778 inject, fork, compare\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc778 inject(\uc678\ubd80 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc0bd\uc785), fork(\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub77c\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131), compare(\uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uae30\uc758 \ud3c9\ud589 \uad00\ucc30)\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "14\uac1c\uc758 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc0c1\ud488 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ud3c9\ud589\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4 \uc870\uc0ac\uc758 \ucd9c\ubc1c\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc131\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc870\uc0ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 'what if' \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub370\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc778 inject, fork, compare\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper first presents a\nlarge-scale, systematic comparison of prominent abstracted action spaces and\ntokenizers for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) or hierarchical agent models in the\nopen-ended Minecraft. Our analysis reveals that no single action space is\nuniversally optimal; instead, the most effective abstraction is highly\ntask-dependent, creating a dilemma for building generalist agents. To resolve\nthis, we introduce Chain of Action (CoA), a novel framework that unifies\nhigh-level planning and low-level control within a single, monolithic VLA\nmodel. CoA treats an abstracted action not as a command for a separate policy,\nbut as an intermediate reasoning step--akin to a chain of thought--that guides\nthe generation of the final, executable action. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat an All-in-One agent trained on a diverse mixture of action spaces using\nthe CoA paradigm learns a more robust and generalizable policy. This unified\nagent achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving the overall task success rate\nover strong, specialized baselines.

Three neural network architectures - a deep dense\nnetwork, a shallow three-layer network, and a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) - are implemented and compared using the TensorFlow and PyTorch\nframeworks. Results indicate that the Adagrad and RMSprop optimizers\nconsistently perform well across different frequency bands, with Adadelta\nexhibiting robust performance in cross-model evaluations. Specifically, Adagrad\nexcels in the beta band, while RMSprop achieves superior performance in the\ngamma band. Conversely, SGD and FTRL exhibit inconsistent performance. Among\nthe models, the CNN demonstrates the second highest accuracy, particularly in\ncapturing spatial features of EEG data. The deep dense network shows\ncompetitive performance in learning complex patterns, whereas the shallow\nthree-layer network, sometimes being less accurate, provides computational\nefficiency. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) plots are employed to identify\nefficient class prediction, revealing nuanced contributions of EEG frequency\nbands to model accuracy.

Existing UAV frameworks\nlack context-aware reasoning, autonomous decision-making, and ecosystem-level\nintegration; critically, none leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents with\ntool-calling for real-time knowledge access. This paper introduces the Agentic\nUAVs framework, a five-layer architecture (Perception, Reasoning, Action,\nIntegration, Learning) that augments UAVs with LLM-driven reasoning, database\nquerying, and third-party system interaction. A ROS2 and Gazebo-based prototype\nintegrates YOLOv11 object detection with GPT-4 reasoning and local Gemma-3\ndeployment. In simulated search-and-rescue scenarios, agentic UAVs achieved\nhigher detection confidence (0.79 vs. 0.72), improved person detection rates\n(91% vs. 75%), and markedly increased action recommendation (92% vs. 4.5%).\nThese results confirm that modest computational overhead enables qualitatively\nnew levels of autonomy and ecosystem integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "UAVs\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc790\uc728\uc131 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 5\uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 Agentic UAVs \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec, \uc7ac\ub09c \uad6c\uc870 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "motivation": "UAV\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc790\uc728\uc131 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \ub0ae\uace0, \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc784\ubb34\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Agentic UAVs \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd, \ucd94\ub860, \ud589\ub3d9, \ud1b5\ud569, \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 5\uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c LLM-driven \ucd94\ub860, \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \ucffc\ub9ac, \uc81c3\uc790 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 UAV\ub294 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4(0.79 \ub300 0.72), \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc778\ubb3c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ube44\uc728(91% \ub300 75%), \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ucd94\ucc9c(92% \ub300 4.5%)\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub0ae\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc778 \ube44\ud589\uae30(UAV)\ub294 \ubc29\uc5b4, \uac10\uc2dc \ubc0f \uc7ac\ub09c \ub300\uc751\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 SAE Level 2-3 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc640 \uc881\uc740 AI\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc784\ubb34\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 UAV \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd \ucd94\ub860, \uc790\uc728\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubc0f \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \uc218\uc900 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub294 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860, \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \ucffc\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc81c3\uc790 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 UAV\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 5\uacc4\uce35 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(\uc778\uc2dd, \ucd94\ub860, \ud589\ub3d9, \ud1b5\ud569, \ud559\uc2b5)\uc778 Agentic UAVs \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

This paper introduces $Agent^2$, a novel\nagent-generates-agent framework that achieves fully automated RL agent design\nthrough intelligent LLM-driven generation. The system autonomously transforms\nnatural language task descriptions and environment code into comprehensive,\nhigh-performance reinforcement learning solutions without human intervention.\n$Agent^2$ features a revolutionary dual-agent architecture. The Generator Agent\nserves as an autonomous AI designer that analyzes tasks and generates\nexecutable RL agents, while the Target Agent is the resulting automatically\ngenerated RL agent. The framework decomposes RL development into two distinct\nstages: MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, enabling more targeted and\neffective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, $Agent^2$\nprovides a unified framework that standardizes intelligent agent creation\nacross diverse environments and algorithms, while incorporating adaptive\ntraining management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous\nimprovement. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including\nMuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC, demonstrate that $Agent^2$ consistently\noutperforms manually designed solutions across all tasks, achieving up to 55%\nperformance improvement and substantial gains on average.

We\nequip Claude Code agents with MCP-based social media and journaling tools and\nallow them to use these tools as they see fit. Across 34 Aider Polyglot Python\nprogramming challenges, collaborative tools substantially improve performance\non the hardest problems, delivering 15-40% lower cost, 12-27% fewer turns, and\n12-38% faster completion than baseline agents. Effects on the full challenge\nset are mixed, suggesting these tools act as performance enhancers when\nadditional reasoning scaffolding is most needed. Surprisingly, Different models\nnaturally adopted distinct collaborative strategies without explicit\ninstruction. Sonnet 3.7 engaged broadly across tools and benefited from\narticulation-based cognitive scaffolding. Sonnet 4 showed selective adoption,\nleaning on journal-based semantic search when problems were genuinely\ndifficult.

To address these critical\nshortcomings, we introduce NIRVANA, a novel pruning method explicitly designed\nto balance immediate zero-shot accuracy preservation with robust fine-tuning\ncapability. Leveraging a first-order saliency criterion derived from the Neural\nTangent Kernel under Adam optimization dynamics, NIRVANA provides a\ntheoretically grounded pruning strategy that respects essential model training\nbehaviors. To further address the unique challenges posed by structured\npruning, NIRVANA incorporates an adaptive sparsity allocation mechanism across\nlayers and modules (attention vs. MLP), which adjusts pruning intensity between\nmodules in a globally balanced manner. Additionally, to mitigate the high\nsensitivity of pruning decisions to calibration data quality, we propose a\nsimple yet effective KL divergence-based calibration data selection strategy,\nensuring more reliable and task-agnostic pruning outcomes. Comprehensive\nexperiments conducted on Llama3, Qwen, and T5 models demonstrate that NIRVANA\noutperforms existing structured pruning methods under equivalent sparsity\nconstraints, providing a theoretically sound and practical approach to LLM\ncompression.

We found that conventional\napproaches that specify agent behaviors through implicit natural language\ndescriptions cannot yield consistent behaviors across models, and the produced\nagent behaviors do not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast,\nCoBRA presents a new approach to program agents' cognitive biases explicitly,\nby grounding agents' expected behaviors using classic social science\nexperiments. CoBRA has two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures\nthe cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a\nset of validated classical social science experiments; (2) Behavioral\nRegulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to demonstrate controlled\ncognitive bias. We evaluated CoBRA as an HCI toolkit through demonstration and\ntechnical benchmarks. Our results suggest that CoBRA can precisely program the\ncognitive bias demonstrated in a social agent in a model-agnostic manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CoBRA\ub77c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\ud68c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud234\ud0b7\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubb18\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CoBRA\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc0ac\ud68c \uacfc\ud559 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\ub300 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CoBRA\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc0ac\ud68c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc9c0\uc218, (2) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CoBRA\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc0ac\ud68c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\ud68c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud234\ud0b7\uc778 CoBRA\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc124\uba85\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c CoBRA\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\ub300 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uace0\uc804 \uc0ac\ud68c \uacfc\ud559 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However,\ntheir inability to reliably execute toggle control instructions remains a key\nbottleneck. To investigate this, we construct a state control benchmark with\nbinary toggle instructions from public datasets. Evaluations of existing agents\ndemonstrate their unreliability, particularly when the current toggle state\nalready matches the desired state. To address the challenge, we propose\nState-aware Reasoning (StaR), a training method that teaches agents to perceive\nthe current toggle state, analyze the desired state from the instruction, and\nact accordingly. Experiments on three multimodal agents demonstrate that StaR\ncan improve toggle instruction execution accuracy by over 30\\%.

Integrating external\ntools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent\nadvances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing\ntool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and\nenhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR\n(Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen,\na multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality\ndatasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and\ngeneralizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained\nhierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes\nfor both trajectory-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This\nis motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call\nis a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR\nincorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback\nto dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference.

To simplify access to predefined AI\nservices, this paper introduces MIRA, a pioneering framework for task\ninstruction recommendation that enables intuitive one-touch AI tasking on\nsmartphones. With MIRA, users can long-press on images or text objects to\nreceive contextually relevant instruction recommendations for executing AI\ntasks. Our work introduces three key innovations: 1) A multimodal large\nlanguage model (MLLM)-based recommendation pipeline with structured reasoning\nto extract key entities, infer user intent, and generate precise instructions;\n2) A template-augmented reasoning mechanism that integrates high-level\nreasoning templates, enhancing task inference accuracy; 3) A prefix-tree-based\nconstrained decoding strategy that restricts outputs to predefined instruction\ncandidates, ensuring coherent and intent-aligned suggestions. Through\nevaluation using a real-world annotated datasets and a user study, MIRA has\ndemonstrated substantial improvements in the accuracy of instruction\nrecommendation. The encouraging results highlight MIRA's potential to\nrevolutionize the way users engage with AI services on their smartphones,\noffering a more seamless and efficient experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "MIRA\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc778 AI \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uc2dc \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub098 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac1d\uccb4\ub97c \uae38\uac8c \ub20c\ub7ec \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uae30\uae30\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "MIRA\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ucc9c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778, \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf \ubcf4\uac15 \ucd94\ub860 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc811\ub450\uc0ac \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MIRA\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc8fc\uc11d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc2dc \ucd94\ucc9c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MIRA\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uae30\uae30 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c AI \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uc2dc \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MIRA\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

While recent methods begin to leverage diverse annotation\nsources-including Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs),\nand human experts-they often focus narrowly on the labeling step itself. A\ncritical gap remains in the holistic process control required to manage these\nsources dynamically, addressing complex scheduling and quality-cost trade-offs\nin a unified manner. Inspired by real-world crowdsourcing companies, we\nintroduce CrowdAgent, a multi-agent system that provides end-to-end process\ncontrol by integrating task assignment, data annotation, and quality/cost\nmanagement. It implements a novel methodology that rationally assigns tasks,\nenabling LLMs, SLMs, and human experts to advance synergistically in a\ncollaborative annotation workflow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nCrowdAgent through extensive experiments on six diverse multimodal\nclassification tasks.

For example, neuroimaging datasets do not provide a sufficient\nrepresentation of heart features for the modeling of cardiovascular factors in\nbrain disorders. To tackle this problem we introduce a probabilistic framework\nfor joint cardiac data imputation and personalisation of cardiovascular\nmechanistic models, with application to brain studies with incomplete heart\ndata. Our approach is based on a variational framework for the joint inference\nof an imputation model of cardiac information from the available features,\nalong with a Gaussian Process emulator that can faithfully reproduce\npersonalised cardiovascular dynamics. Experimental results on UK Biobank show\nthat our model allows accurate imputation of missing cardiac features in\ndatasets containing minimal heart information, e.g. systolic and diastolic\nblood pressures only, while jointly estimating the emulated parameters of the\nlumped model. This allows a novel exploration of the heart-brain joint\nrelationship through simulation of realistic cardiac dynamics corresponding to\ndifferent conditions of brain anatomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc2ec\uc7a5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub1cc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2ec\uc7a5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\uc644 \ubc0f \uc2ec\ud608\uad00 \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud574\ubd80\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uc0dd\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud658\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uc7a5 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc644 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcc0\ubd84 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "UK Biobank\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc2ec\uc7a5 \uc815\ubcf4\ub9cc \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ub204\ub77d\ub41c \uc2ec\uc7a5 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ubcf4\uc644\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub1cc \ud574\ubd80\ud559\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc2ec\uc7a5 \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2ec\uc7a5-\ub1cc \uacf5\ub3d9 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud574\ubd80\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uc0dd\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud658\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc2e0\uacbd\uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \ub1cc \uc7a5\uc560\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\ud608\uad00 \uc694\uc18c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2ec\uc7a5 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc2ec\uc7a5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub1cc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2ec\uc7a5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\uc644 \ubc0f \uc2ec\ud608\uad00 \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uc7a5 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc644 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcc0\ubd84 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc2ec\ud608\uad00 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ucda9\uc2e4\ud558\uac8c \uc7ac\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc5d0\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud568\uaed8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
