Current optimization methods focus on single-agent settings and lack a principled framework for this multi-agent, multi-objective problem.\n  This thesis introduces MALBO (Multi-Agent LLM Bayesian Optimization), a systematic framework designed to automate the efficient composition of LLM-based agent teams. We formalize the assignment challenge as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to identify the Pareto front of configurations between task accuracy and inference cost. The methodology employs multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) with independent Gaussian Process surrogate models. By searching over a continuous feature-space representation of the LLMs, this approach performs a sample-efficient exploration guided by the expected hypervolume improvement.\n  The primary contribution is a principled and automated methodology that yields a Pareto front of optimal team configurations. Our results demonstrate that the Bayesian optimization phase, compared to an initial random search, maintained a comparable average performance while reducing the average configuration cost by over 45%. Furthermore, MALBO identified specialized, heterogeneous teams that achieve cost reductions of up to 65.8% compared to homogeneous baselines, all while maintaining maximum performance. The framework thus provides a data-driven tool for deploying cost-effective and highly specialized multi-agent AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MALBO\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911

A common practice is to assign agents with personas to encourage behavioral diversity. However, this raises a critical yet underexplored question: do personas introduce biases into multi-agent interactions? This paper presents a systematic investigation into persona-induced biases in multi-agent interactions, with a focus on social traits like trustworthiness (how an agent's opinion is received by others) and insistence (how strongly an agent advocates for its opinion). Through a series of controlled experiments in collaborative problem-solving and persuasion tasks, we reveal that (1) LLM-based agents exhibit biases in both trustworthiness and insistence, with personas from historically advantaged groups (e.g., men and White individuals) perceived as less trustworthy and demonstrating less insistence; and (2) agents exhibit significant in-group favoritism, showing a higher tendency to conform to others who share the same persona. These biases persist across various LLMs, group sizes, and numbers of interaction rounds, highlighting an urgent need for awareness and mitigation to ensure the fairness and reliability of multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\uac00 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ud611\uc5c5 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uacfc \uc124\ub4dd \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uac15\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uac00 \ub0ae\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uac15\ub3c4\uac00 \uc801\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc5d0\uac8c \uc21c\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uac15\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM, \uadf8\ub8f9 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \uc644\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uad00\ud589\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\ub3d9 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub77c\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131(\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uacac\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc5d0\uac8c \uc218\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc815\ub3c4)\uacfc \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uac15\ub3c4(\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc758\uacac\uc744 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\ub294\uc9c0)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\uac00 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud611\uc5c5 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ubc0f \uc124\ub4dd \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, (1) LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uac15\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9(\uc608: \ub0a8\uc131 \ubc0f \ubc31\uc778)\uc758 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub294 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uac15\ub3c4\uac00 \uc801\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c\ub2e4; (2) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud3b8\uc560\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uac19\uc740 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc5d0\uac8c \ub354\uc6b1 \uc21c\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM, \uadf8\ub8f9 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \uc644\ud654\uac00 \uae34\uae09\ud558\uac8c \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4."}}

These real-world constraints pose significant challenges for coordination, particularly when vehicles pursue individual objectives. To address this, we propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that enables vehicles, acting as agents, to communicate selectively based on local goals and observations. This goal-aware communication strategy allows agents to share only relevant information, enhancing collaboration while respecting visibility limitations. We validate our approach in complex multi-agent navigation tasks featuring obstacles and dynamic agent populations. Results show that our method significantly improves task success rates and reduces time-to-goal compared to non-cooperative baselines. Moreover, task performance remains stable as the number of agents increases, demonstrating scalability.

Crafting universal filtering rules remains difficult due to their inherent dependence on specific contexts. To address these challenges without relying on threshold calibration or model fine-tuning, this work introduces a semantic consistency analysis between successful and unsuccessful responses, demonstrating that a negation-aware scoring approach captures meaningful patterns. Building on this insight, a novel detection framework called NegBLEURT Forest is proposed to evaluate the degree of alignment between outputs elicited by adversarial prompts and expected safe behaviors. It identifies anomalous responses using the Isolation Forest algorithm, enabling reliable jailbreak detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently achieves top-tier performance, ranking first or second in accuracy across diverse models using the crafted dataset, while competing approaches exhibit notable sensitivity to model and data variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub294 jailbreak \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac10\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 NegBLEURT Forest\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 jailbreak \uac80\ucd9c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0\ub3c4 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 jailbreak \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc751\ub2f5\uacfc \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \ub124\uac70\uc774\uc158 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc810\uc218 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 NegBLEURT Forest\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac10\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c 1\uc704 \ub610\ub294 2\uc704\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uacbd\uc7c1\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "NegBLEURT Forest\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 jailbreak \uac80\ucd9c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c jailbreak \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uacfc\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc774 \ud574\ub86d\uac70\ub098 \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub974\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc751\ub2f5\uacfc \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \ubd80\uc815\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \uc810\uc218 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uacf5\uaca9\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ucd9c\ub825\uacfc \uc608\uc0c1 \uc548\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9 \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 NegBLEURT Forest\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac10\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc740 Isolation Forest \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 jailbreak \uac80\ucd9c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd5c\uc6b0\uc218 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

SynBullying provides a scalable and ethically safe alternative to human data collection by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic bullying interactions. The dataset offers (i) conversational structure, capturing multi-turn exchanges rather than isolated posts; (ii) context-aware annotations, where harmfulness is assessed within the conversational flow considering context, intent, and discourse dynamics; and (iii) fine-grained labeling, covering various CB categories for detailed linguistic and behavioral analysis.

The increasing popularity of algorithmic decision-making has stimulated interest in algorithmic fairness within the academic community. Researchers have introduced various fairness definitions that quantify disparities between privileged and protected groups, use causal inference to determine the impact of race on model predictions, and that test calibration of probability predictions from the model. Existing literature does not provide a way in which to assess whether observed disparities between groups are statistically significant or merely due to chance. This paper introduces a rigorous framework for testing the statistical significance of fairness violations by leveraging k-fold cross-validation [2] to generate sampling distributions of fairness metrics. This paper introduces statistical tests that can be used to identify statistically significant violations of fairness metrics based on disparities between predicted and actual outcomes, model calibration, and causal inference techniques [1]. We demonstrate this approach by testing recidivism forecasting algorithms trained on data from the National Institute of Justice. Our findings reveal that machine learning algorithms used for recidivism forecasting exhibit statistically significant bias against Black individuals under several fairness definitions, while also exhibiting no bias or bias against White individuals under other definitions. The results from this paper underscore the importance of rigorous and robust statistical testing while evaluating algorithmic decision-making systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Experiments on multiple stocks and market conditions show that FinRS achieves superior profitability and stability compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FinRS\ub294 \uae08\uc735 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8-\ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uac70\ub798 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uac70\ub798 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uac70\ub798 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ud070 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub0ae\ucd94\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4.", "method": "FinRS\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ubd84\uc11d, \uc774\uc911 \uacb0\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\uac04 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc18\uc601\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uac70\ub798 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc218\uc775 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \ud558\ubc29 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc8fc\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, FinRS\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc218\uc775\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \uae08\uc735 \uac70\ub798\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uac70\ub798 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ud070 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac70\ub798 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc218\uc775 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \ud558\ubc29 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ubd84\uc11d, \uc774\uc911 \uacb0\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\uac04 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc18\uc601\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8-\ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uac70\ub798 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FinRS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc8fc\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c FinRS\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc218\uc775\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Existing VD techniques, whether traditional machine learning-based or LLM-based approaches like prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, or off-policy preference optimization, remain fundamentally limited in their ability to perform context-aware analysis: They depend on fixed inputs or static preference datasets, cannot adaptively explore repository-level dependencies, and are constrained by function-level benchmarks that overlook critical vulnerability context.\n  This paper introduces Vulnerability-Adaptive Policy Optimization (VULPO), an on-policy LLM reinforcement learning framework for context-aware VD. To support training and evaluation, we first construct ContextVul, a new dataset that augments high-quality function-level samples with lightweight method to extract repository-level context information. We then design multi-dimensional reward structuring that jointly captures prediction correctness, vulnerability localization accuracy, and the semantic relevance of vulnerability analysis, thereby guiding the model toward comprehensive contextual reasoning. To address the asymmetric difficulty of different vulnerability cases and mitigate reward hacking, VULPO incorporates label-level and sample-level difficulty-adaptive reward scaling, encouraging the model to explore challenging cases while maintaining balanced reward distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our VULPO framework in context-aware VD: Our VULPO-4B substantially outperforms existing VD baselines based on prompt engineering and off-policy

Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity.

However, contemporary memory systems often adopt complex architectures such as knowledge graphs, multi-stage retrieval pipelines, and OS-style schedulers, which introduce engineering complexity and reproducibility challenges. We present ENGRAM, a lightweight memory system that organizes conversation into three canonical memory types (episodic, semantic, and procedural) through a single router and retriever. Each user turn is converted into typed memory records with normalized schemas and embeddings and stored in a database. At query time, the system retrieves top-k dense neighbors for each type, merges results with simple set operations, and provides the most relevant evidence as context to the model. ENGRAM attains state-of-the-art results on LoCoMo, a multi-session conversational QA benchmark for long-horizon memory, and exceeds the full-context baseline by 15 points on LongMemEval while using only about 1% of the tokens.

However, existing fuzzers are falling short in detecting sophisticated vulnerabilities that require specific attack transaction sequences with proper inputs to trigger, as they (i) prioritize code coverage over vulnerability discovery, wasting considerable effort on non-vulnerable code regions, and (ii) lack semantic understanding of stateful contracts, generating numerous invalid transaction sequences that cannot pass runtime execution.\n  In this paper, we propose SmartFuzz, a novel collaborative reflective fuzzer for smart contract vulnerability detection. It employs large language model-driven agents as the fuzzing engine and continuously improves itself by learning and reflecting through interactions with the environment. Specifically, we first propose a new Continuous Reflection Process (CRP) for fuzzing smart contracts, which reforms the transaction sequence generation as a self-evolving process through continuous reflection on feedback from the runtime environment. Then, we present the Reactive Collaborative Chain (RCC) to orchestrate the fuzzing process into multiple sub-tasks based on the dependencies of transaction sequences. Furthermore, we design a multi-agent collaborative team, where each expert agent is guided by the RCC to jointly generate and refine transaction sequences from both global and local perspectives. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate SmartFuzz's performance on real-world contracts and DApp projects. The results demonstrate that SmartFuzz outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools: (i) it detects 5.8\\%-74.7\\% more vulnerabilities within 30 minutes, and (ii) it reduces false negatives by up to 80\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "SmartFuzz\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud37c\uc800\ub4e4\uc774 \uac00\uc9c0\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud611\uc5c5 \ubc18\uc601 \ud37c\uc800\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ud37c\uc800\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud37c\uc9d5 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\uc601 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 SmartFuzz\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SmartFuzz\uac00 \uae30\uc874 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 5.8%-74.7% \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ud5c8\uc704 \ubd80\uc815\ub960\uc744 80%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SmartFuzz\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \ud37c\uc9d5 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud37c\uc9d5\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uae30\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ud37c\uc800\ub4e4\uc740 (i) \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucf54\ub4dc \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ucde8\uc57d \ucf54\ub4dc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ub0ad\ube44\ud558\uba70, (ii) \uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\uc57d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ud1b5\uacfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubb34\uc218\ud55c \ubb34\ud6a8 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud611\uc5c5 \ubc18\uc601 \ud37c\uc800\uc778 SmartFuzz\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

AI-generated creative ideas in science are rare and often vague, so that it remains a human task to execute them. Automating idea generation and implementation in one coherent system would significantly shift the role of humans in the scientific process. Here we present AI-Mandel, an LLM agent that can generate and implement ideas in quantum physics. AI-Mandel formulates ideas from the literature and uses a domain-specific AI tool to turn them into concrete experiment designs that can readily be implemented in laboratories. The generated ideas by AI-Mandel are often scientifically interesting - for two of them we have already written independent scientific follow-up papers. The ideas include new variations of quantum teleportation, primitives of quantum networks in indefinite causal orders, and new concepts of geometric phases based on closed loops of quantum information transfer. AI-Mandel is a prototypical demonstration of an AI physicist that can generate and implement concrete, actionable ideas.

However, RL agents often operate under the assumption of environmental stationarity, which poses a great challenge to learning efficiency since many environments are inherently non-stationary. This non-stationarity results in the requirement of millions of iterations, leading to low sample efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce the Clustering Orthogonal Weight Modified (COWM) layer, which can be integrated into the policy network of any RL algorithm and mitigate non-stationarity effectively. The COWM layer stabilizes the learning process by employing clustering techniques and a projection matrix. Our approach not only improves learning speed but also reduces gradient interference, thereby enhancing the overall learning efficiency. Empirically, the COWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves improvements of 9% and 12.6% in vision based and state-based DMControl benchmark.

However, a systematic understanding of the interactions between market participants, data, and regulations remains limited. To address this gap, we propose a Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) for data marketplaces. In our framework, buyer and seller agents powered by LLMs operate with explicit objectives and autonomously perform strategic actions, such as planning, searching, purchasing, pricing, and updating data. These agents can reason about market dynamics, forecast future demand, and adjust strategies accordingly. Unlike conventional model-based simulations, which are typically constrained to predefined rules, LLM-MAS supports broader and more adaptive behavior selection through natural language reasoning. We evaluated the framework via simulation experiments using three distribution-based metrics: (1) the number of purchases per dataset, (2) the number of purchases per buyer, and (3) the number of repeated purchases of the same dataset. The results demonstrate that LLM-MAS more faithfully reproduces trading patterns observed in real data marketplaces compared to traditional approaches, and further captures the emergence and evolution of market trends.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9c8\ucf13\ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \uad6c\ub9e4 \ubc0f \uad50\ud658\uc744 \uc911\uac1c\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911

Rule-based detection often identifies malicious logs based on the predefined grammar logic, requiring experts with deep domain knowledge for rule generation. Therefore, automation of rule generation can result in significant time savings and ease the burden of rule-related tasks on security engineers. In this paper, we propose RulePilot, which mimics human expertise via LLM-based agent for addressing rule-related challenges like rule creation or conversion. Using RulePilot, the security analysts do not need to write down the rules following the grammar, instead, they can just provide the annotations such as the natural-language-based descriptions of a rule, our RulePilot can automatically generate the detection rules without more intervention. RulePilot is equipped with the intermediate representation (IR), which abstracts the complexity of config rules into structured, standardized formats, allowing LLMs to focus on generation rules in a more manageable and consistent way. We present a comprehensive evaluation of RulePilot in terms of textual similarity and execution success abilities, showcasing RulePilot can generate high-fidelity rules, outperforming the baseline models by up to 107.4% in textual similarity to ground truths and achieving better detection accuracy in real-world execution tests.

Current methods lack the adaptive policies needed to dynamically debug queries based on real-time execution feedback. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer. On a curated, executable single-answer subset of LC-QuAD 2.0, our agent achieves 49.7\\% accuracy post-entity-linking, a significant 17.5 percentage point improvement over the strongest iterative zero-shot baseline. Further analysis reveals that while the agent's capability is driven by RL, its performance is enhanced by an explicit deliberative reasoning step that acts as a cognitive scaffold to improve policy precision.

In this work, we systematically study the effect of tokenizer design, specifically scaling and quantization strategies, on model performance, alongside the impact of pretraining versus random initialization. We show that tokenizer configuration primarily governs the representational capacity and stability of the model, while transfer learning influences optimization efficiency and alignment. Using a combination of empirical training experiments and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that pretrained models consistently leverage well-designed tokenizers more effectively, particularly at smaller vocabulary sizes. Conversely, misaligned tokenization can diminish or even invert the benefits of pretraining. These findings highlight the importance of careful tokenization in time series modeling and suggest that combining small, efficient vocabularies with pretrained weights is especially advantageous in multi-modal forecasting settings, where the overall vocabulary must be shared across modalities.

We investigate this using 5-agent LLM-based trading systems across 450 experiments spanning 21 months, comparing five organizational structures from isolated baseline to collaborative and competitive conversation. We show that communication improves performance, but optimal communication design depends on market characteristics. Competitive conversation excels in volatile technology stocks, while collaborative conversation dominates stable general stocks. Finance stocks resist all communication interventions. Surprisingly, all structures, including isolated agents, converge to similar strategy alignments, challenging assumptions that transparency causes harmful diversity loss. Performance differences stem from behavioral mechanisms: competitive agents focus on stock-level allocation while collaborative agents develop technical frameworks. Conversation quality scores show zero correlation with returns. These findings demonstrate that optimal communication design must match market volatility characteristics, and sophisticated discussions don't guarantee better performance.", "AI": {"tldr":

Physical-Layer Security (PLS) is therefore pivotal to deliver lightweight, information-theoretic protection, but still requires strong, reconfigurable confusion components that can be diversified per slice, session, or device to blunt large-scale precomputation and side-channel attacks. In order to address the above requirement, we introduce the first-ever chaos-lifted substitution box (S-box) for PLS that couples a $\u03b2$-transformation-driven dynamical system with dyadic conditional sampling to generate time-varying, seedable 8-bit permutations on demand. This construction preserves uniformity via ergodicity, yields full 8-bit bijections, and supports on-the-fly diversification across sessions. The resulting S-box attains optimal algebraic degree 7 on every output bit and high average nonlinearity 102.5 (85% of the 8-bit bound), strengthening resistance to algebraic and linear cryptanalysis. Differential and linear profiling report max DDT entry 10 (probability 0.039) and max linear probability 0.648, motivating deployment within a multi-round cipher with a strong diffusion layer, where the security-to-efficiency trade-off is compelling.

We present Frame-to-Outcome (F2O), an end-to-end system that translates tissue dissection videos into gesture sequences and uncovers patterns associated with postoperative outcomes. Leveraging transformer-based spatial and temporal modeling and frame-wise classification, F2O robustly detects consecutive short (~2 seconds) gestures in the nerve-sparing step of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (AUC: 0.80 frame-level; 0.81 video-level). F2O-derived features (gesture frequency, duration, and transitions) predicted postoperative outcomes with accuracy comparable to human annotations (0.79 vs. 0.75; overlapping 95% CI). Across 25 shared features, effect size directions were concordant with small differences (~ 0.07), and strong correlation (r = 0.96, p < 1e-14). F2O also captured key patterns linked to erectile function recovery, including prolonged tissue peeling and reduced energy use.

However, the models remain vulnerable at inference time when they are trained collaboratively through Federated Learning (FL), an approach adopted to protect patient privacy. Adversarial attacks can subtly alter medical scans in ways invisible to the human eye yet powerful enough to mislead AI models, potentially causing serious misdiagnoses. Existing defenses often assume centralized data and struggle to cope with the decentralized and diverse nature of federated medical settings. In this work, we present MedFedPure, a personalized federated learning defense framework designed to protect diagnostic AI models at inference time without compromising privacy or accuracy. MedFedPure combines three key elements: (1) a personalized FL model that adapts to the unique data distribution of each institution; (2) a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that detects suspicious inputs by exposing hidden perturbations; and (3) an adaptive diffusion-based purification module that selectively cleans only the flagged scans before classification. Together, these steps offer robust protection while preserving the integrity of normal, benign images. We evaluated MedFedPure on the Br35H brain MRI dataset. The results show a significant gain in adversarial robustness, improving performance from 49.50% to 87.33% under strong attacks, while maintaining a high clean accuracy of 97.67%.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), often modeling each traffic signal as an independent agent using Q-learning, has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce average commuter delays. While prior work Prashant L A et. al has empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, a rigorous theoretical analysis of its stability and convergence properties in the context of traffic control has not been explored. This paper bridges that gap by focusing squarely on the theoretical basis of this multi-agent algorithm. We investigate the convergence problem inherent in using independent learners for the cooperative TSC task. Utilizing stochastic approximation methods, we formally analyze the learning dynamics.

IaC enables organizations to create scalable and consistent environments, effectively managing servers and development settings. However, the growing complexity of cloud infrastructures has led to an increased risk of misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities in IaC scripts. To address this problem, this paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating security-aware IaC code, avoiding misconfigurations introduced by developers and administrators.\n  While LLMs have made significant progress in natural language processing and code generation, their ability to generate secure IaC scripts remains unclear. This paper addresses two major problems: 1) the lack of understanding of security weaknesses in IaC scripts generated by LLMs, and 2) the absence of techniques for enhancing security in generating IaC code with LLMs.\n  To assess the extent to which LLMs contain security knowledge, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of base LLMs in recognizing major IaC security weaknesses during the generation and inspection of IaC code. Then, we propose GenSIaC, an instruction fine-tuning dataset designed to improve LLMs' ability to recognize potential security weaknesses. Leveraging GenSIaC, we fine-tune LLMs and instruct models to generate security-aware IaC code. Our evaluation demonstrates that our models achieve substantially improved performance in recognizing and preventing IaC security misconfigurations, e.g., boosting the F1-score from 0.303 to 0.858. Additionally, we perform ablation studies and explore GenSIaC's generalizability to other LLMs and its cross-language capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc778\uc2dd IaC \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c IaC \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uad6c\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "LLM\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, GenSIaC\ub77c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548-aware IaC \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 IaC \ubcf4\uc548 \uc798\ubabb \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \uc785\uc99d, F1-score\uac00 0.303\uc5d0\uc11c 0.858\ub85c \uc99d\uac00.", "conclusion": "GenSIaC\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 LLM\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \ubc94\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ucf54\ub4dc(IaC)\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c IT \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \ud504\ub85c\ube44\uc800\ub2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We examined four LLM models (GPT-4.1-Mini, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Llama-3.3-70b) utilizing four different reasoning architectures (single-shot, embedding-controlled repetition, self-reflection, and multi-agent) on the RAVEN-FAIR dataset. Visual responses generated through a three-stage process (JSON extraction, LLM reasoning, and Tool Function) were evaluated using SSIM and LPIPS metrics; Chain-of-Thought scores and error types (semantic hallucination, numeric misperception) were analyzed. Results demonstrate that GPT-4.1-Mini consistently achieved the highest overall accuracy across all architectures, indicating a strong reasoning capability. While the multi-agent architecture occasionally altered semantic and numeric balance across models, these effects were not uniformly beneficial. Instead, each model exhibited distinct sensitivity patterns to architectural design, underscoring that reasoning effectiveness remains model-specific. Variations in response coverage further emerged as a confounding factor that complicates direct cross-architecture comparison. To estimate the upper-bound performance of each configuration, we report the best of five independent runs, representing a best-case scenario rather than an averaged outcome. This multi-run strategy aligns with recent recommendations, which emphasize that single-run evaluations are fragile and may lead to unreliable conclusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \uc2dc\uac01 \ucd94\ub860 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778\uc9c0 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "RAVEN-FAIR \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 LLM \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd94\ub860 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(JSON \ucd94\ucd9c, LLM \ucd94\ub860, \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ub2a5)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568.", "result": "GPT-4.1-Mini\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac10\ub3c4\uac00 \ub2e4\ub984\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud558\uba70, \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud568. \ub610\ud55c, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \uc2dc\uac01 \ucd94\ub860 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RAVEN-FAIR \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 LLM \ubaa8\ub378(GPT-4.1-Mini, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Llama-3.3-70b)\uacfc \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd94\ub860 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(\ub2e8\uc77c \uc0f7, \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc18\ubcf5, \uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc601, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

In this paper, we propose LTSV, a Lightweight Time Series Valuation on TSFMS via in-context finetuning. Grounded in the theoretical evidence that in-context finetuning approximates the influence function, LTSV estimates a sample's contribution by measuring the change in context loss after in-context finetuning, leveraging the strong generalization capabilities of TSFMs to produce robust and transferable data valuations. To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce temporal block aggregation, which integrates per-block influence scores across overlapping time windows. Experiments across multiple time series datasets and models demonstrate that LTSV consistently provides reliable and strong valuation performance, while maintaining manageable computational requirements. Our results suggest that in-context finetuning on time series foundation models provides a practical and effective bridge between data attribution and model generalization in time series learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "LTSV\ub77c\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 TSFM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc9c8\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc774 \ud06c\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "LTSV\ub294 \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04 \ube14\ub85d \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LTSV\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc740 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uadc0\uc18d\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac04\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\ub9ac \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(TSFM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc740 TSFM \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 TSFM \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \ucee4\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub0b4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 TSFM\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ud3c9\uac00(LTSV)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub0b4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c LTSV\ub294 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub0b4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc774\ud6c4\uc758 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc190\uc2e4 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uba70, TSFM\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacac\uace0\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uac04 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\ucca9\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc3d\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ube14\ub85d\ub2f9 \uc601\ud5a5 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \ube14\ub85d \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, LTSV\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 TSFM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uadc0\uc18d\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac04\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\ub9ac \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We introduce a proof-of-concept conversational self-triage system that guides LLMs with 100 clinically validated flowcharts from the American Medical Association, providing a structured and auditable framework for patient decision support. The system leverages a multi-agent framework consisting of a retrieval agent, a decision agent, and a chat agent to identify the most relevant flowchart, interpret patient responses, and deliver personalized, patient-friendly recommendations, respectively. Performance was evaluated at scale using synthetic datasets of simulated conversations. The system achieved 95.29% top-3 accuracy in flowchart retrieval (N=2,000) and 99.10% accuracy in flowchart navigation across varied conversational styles and conditions (N=37,200). By combining the flexibility of free-text interaction with the rigor of standardized clinical protocols, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of transparent, accurate, and generalizable

Traditional Web Application Firewalls often struggle to effectively distinguish between malicious and legitimate traffic, leading to limited efficacy in threat detection. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an Adaptive Dual-Layer WAF employing a two-layered Machine Learning model designed to enhance the accuracy of anomaly and threat detection. The first layer employs a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm to detect anomalies by identifying traffic deviations from established normal patterns. The second layer employs Support Vector Machine to classify these anomalies as either threat anomalies or benign anomalies. Our Adaptive Dual Layer WAF incorporates comprehensive data pre-processing and feature engineering techniques and has been thoroughly evaluated using five large benchmark datasets. Evaluation using these datasets shows that ADL WAF achieves a detection accuracy of 99.88% and a precision of 100%, significantly enhancing anomaly detection and reducing false positives. These findings suggest that integrating machine learning techniques into WAFs can substantially improve web application security by providing more accurate and efficient threat detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc774\uc911 \uacc4\uce35 WAF\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6f9 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc6f9 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd\uc740 \uc545\uc131 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uacfc \ud569\ubc95\uc801 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc5ec \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc774\uc911 \uacc4\uce35 WAF\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uacc4\uce35\uc740 \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uacc4\uce35\uc740 \uc11c\ud3ec\ud2b8 \ubca1\ud130 \uba38\uc2e0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ADL WAF\ub294 99.88%\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 100%\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc220\uc744 WAF\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba74 \uc6f9 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ubcf4\uc548\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6f9 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd\uc740 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc6f9 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc6f9 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd\uc740 \uc545\uc131 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uacfc \ud569\ubc95\uc801\uc778 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc5b4 \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc774\uc911 \uacc4\uce35 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc774\uc911 \uacc4\uce35 WAF\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uacc4\uce35\uc740 \uc815\uc0c1 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac(DT) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uacc4\uce35\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud611 \uc774\uc0c1 \ub610\ub294 benign \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc11c\ud3ec\ud2b8 \ubca1\ud130 \uba38\uc2e0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc774\uc911 \uacc4\uce35 WAF\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud2b9\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucca0\uc800\ud788 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, ADL WAF\ub294 99.88%\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 100%\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc904\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc220\uc744 WAF\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc6f9 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces, where identifying partner behaviors and selecting suitable responses is difficult. In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent

Existing transparency mechanisms - including Model Cards, Datasheets, and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) - advance provenance reporting but rarely provide verifiable, machine-readable evidence of model security. This paper introduces the AI Risk Scanning (AIRS) Framework, a threat-model-based, evidence-generating framework designed to operationalize AI assurance. The AIRS Framework evolved through three progressive pilot studies - Smurf (AIBOM schema design), OPAL (operational validation), and Pilot C (AIRS) - that reframed AI documentation from descriptive disclosure toward measurable, evidence-bound verification. The framework aligns its assurance fields to the MITRE ATLAS adversarial ML taxonomy and automatically produces structured artifacts capturing model integrity, packaging and serialization safety, structural adapters, and runtime behaviors. Currently, the AIRS Framework is scoped to provide model-level assurances for LLMs, but it could be expanded to include other modalities and cover system-level threats (e.g. application-layer abuses, tool-calling). A proof-of-concept on a quantized GPT-OSS-20B model demonstrates enforcement of safe loader policies, per-shard hash verification, and contamination and backdoor probes executed under controlled runtime conditions. Comparative analysis with SBOM standards of SPDX 3.0 and CycloneDX 1.6 reveals alignment on identity and evaluation metadata, but identifies critical gaps in representing AI-specific assurance fields.

Statement autoformalization, a crucial first step in this process, aims to translate informal descriptions into machine-verifiable representations but remains a significant challenge. The core difficulty lies in the fact that existing methods often suffer from a lack of contextual awareness, leading to hallucination of formal definitions and theorems. Furthermore, current retrieval-augmented approaches exhibit poor precision and recall for formal library dependency retrieval, and lack the scalability to effectively leverage ever-growing public datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework based on DDR (\\textit{Direct Dependency Retrieval}) for statement autoformalization. Our DDR method directly generates candidate library dependencies from natural language mathematical descriptions and subsequently verifies their existence within the formal library via an efficient suffix array check. Leveraging this efficient search mechanism, we constructed a dependency retrieval dataset of over 500,000 samples and fine-tuned a high-precision DDR model. Experimental results demonstrate that our DDR model significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both retrieval precision and recall. Consequently, an autoformalizer equipped with DDR shows consistent performance advantages in both single-attempt accuracy and multi-attempt stability compared to models using traditional selection-based RAG methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc218\ud559 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uae30\uacc4 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294

Ecker", "Chase van de Geijn"], "title": "Clifford Algebraic Rotor Embeddings : Maybe embeddings should start to CARE", "comment": null, "summary": "Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have demonstrated exceptional performance as a positional encoding method, consistently outperforming their baselines. While recent work has sought to extend RoPE to higher-dimensional inputs, many such extensions are non-commutative, thereby forfeiting RoPE's shift-equivariance property. Spherical RoPE is one such non-commutative variant, motivated by the idea of rotating embedding vectors on spheres rather than circles. However, spherical rotations are inherently non-commutative, making the choice of rotation sequence ambiguous. In this work, we explore a quaternion-based approach -- Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo) -- in place of Euler angles, leveraging quaternions' ability to represent 3D rotations to parameterize the axes of rotation. We show Mixed RoPE and Spherical RoPE to be special cases of QuatRo. Further, we propose a generalization of QuatRo to Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE) using geometric algebra. Viewing quaternions as the even subalgebra of Cl(3,0,0), we extend the notion of rotary embeddings from quaternions to Clifford rotors acting on multivectors. This formulation enables two key generalizations: (1) extending rotary embeddings to arbitrary dimensions, and (2) encoding positional information in multivectors of multiple grades, not just vectors. We present preliminary experiments comparing spherical, quaternion, and Clifford-based rotary embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c\uc11c QuatRo\uc640 CARE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\uc804 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud568.", "motivation": "RoPE\uc758 \ud68c\uc804 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \ube44\uac00\ud658\uc801\uc778 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc54c\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "\ucffc\ud130\ub2c8\uc628 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud68c\uc804\ucd95\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ud558\uace0, Clifford \ub300\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub85c Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "Mixed RoPE\uc640 Spherical RoPE\uac00 QuatRo\uc758 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\uc804 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \uc81c\uc2dc.", "conclusion": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc6a9\ub3c4\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc74c.", "translated_summary": "\ud68c\uc804 \uc704\uce58 \uc784\ubca0\ub529(RoPE)\uc740 \uc704\uce58 \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 RoPE\ub97c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9ce\uc740 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \ube44\uac00\ud658\uc801\uc774\uc5b4\uc11c RoPE\uc758 \uc774\ub3d9 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\uae30\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uad6c\ud615 RoPE\ub294 \uc6d0\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ud68c\uc804\ud558\ub294 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ube44\uac00\ud658 \ubcc0\ud615 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uad6c\ud615 \ud68c\uc804\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uac00\ud658\uc801\uc774\uc5b4\uc11c \ud68c\uc804 \uc21c\uc11c\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ubaa8\ud638\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucffc\ud130\ub2c8\uc5b8\uc758 3D \ud68c\uc804\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud68c\uc804 \ucd95\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \ucffc\ud130\ub2c8\uc5b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo)\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Mixed RoPE\uc640 Spherical RoPE\uac00 QuatRo\uc758 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac00 \uae30\ud558\ud559 \ub300\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec QuatRo\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucffc\ud130\ub2c8\uc5b8\uc744 Cl(3,0,0)\uc758 \uc9dd\uc218 \ubd80\ubd84\ub300\uc218\ub85c \ubcf4\ub294 \uc774 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4: (1) \ud68c\uc804 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, (2) \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \ubca1\ud130\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub4f1\uae09\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubca1\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\uce58 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad6c\ud615, \ucffc\ud130\ub2c8\uc5b8 \ubc0f Clifford \uae30\ubc18 \ud68c\uc804 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uc608\ube44 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Cioffi"], "title": "On the Fundamental Limits of LLMs at Scale", "comment": "Submitted to TMLR 2025", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758

However, current AI model evaluation practices for developing IDS/IPS focus predominantly on accuracy metrics, often overlooking whether datasets represent industry-specific threats. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional framework that integrates the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base for threat intelligence and employs five complementary metrics that together provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset suitability. Methodologically, this framework combines threat intelligence, natural language processing, and quantitative analysis to assess the suitability of datasets for specific industry contexts. Applying this framework to nine publicly available IDS/IPS datasets reveals significant gaps in threat coverage, particularly in the healthcare, energy, and financial sectors. In particular, recent datasets (e.g., CIC-IoMT, CIC-UNSW-NB15) align better with sector-specific threats, whereas others, like CICIoV-24, underperform despite their recency. Our findings provide a standardized, interpretable approach for selecting datasets aligned with sector-specific operational requirements, ultimately enhancing the real-world effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS deployments. The efficiency and practicality of the framework are validated through deployment in a real-world case study, underscoring its capacity to inform dataset selection and enhance the effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS in operational environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 IDS/IPS\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c

Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5.

For instance, after learning to detect traffic signs, a model may later need to learn to classify traffic lights or different types of vehicles using the same camera feed. This scenario introduces a challenging setting we term Continual Multitask Learning (CMTL), where a model sequentially learns new tasks on an underlying data distribution without forgetting previously learned abilities. Existing continual learning methods often fail in this setting because they learn fragmented, task-specific features that interfere with one another. To address this, we introduce Learning with Preserving (LwP), a novel framework that shifts the focus from preserving task outputs to maintaining the geometric structure of the shared representation space. The core of LwP is a Dynamically Weighted Distance Preservation (DWDP) loss that prevents representation drift by regularizing the pairwise distances between latent data representations. This mechanism of preserving the underlying geometric structure allows the model to retain implicit knowledge and support diverse tasks without requiring a replay buffer, making it suitable for privacy-conscious applications. Extensive evaluations on time-series and image benchmarks show that LwP not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CMTL tasks. Notably, our method shows superior robustness to distribution shifts and is the only approach to surpass the strong single-task learning baseline, underscoring its effectiveness for real-world dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uba40\ud2f0\ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \ud559\uc2b5(CMTL) \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc78a\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c LwP(\ud559\uc2b5 \ubcf4\uc874)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \uc8fc\ud589 \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uacf5\uc720\ub418\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uacc4\uc18d\ud574\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LwP\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uacf5\uc720 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub461\ub2c8\ub2e4.

First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability.

We provide a structured overview of HAPS subsystems and principal communication links, map cybersecurity and privacy exposure across communication, control, and power subsystems, and propose a stratosphere-aware threat taxonomy. We then discuss defenses feasible under HAPS constraints including encryption and authentication, frequency agility, directional and beam-steered antennas, intrusion detection, secure boot, and software and supply-chain assurance-while highlighting how they align with emerging regulatory and standards guidance. Finally, we report a simulation-based case study using OMNeT++/INET to characterize distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) impact on service and control-plane availability, and summarize regulatory and standardization considerations relevant to deployment. We conclude with concrete future research directions. The study is simulation-grounded and intended to inform engineering trade-offs for real-world HAPS deployments rather than serve as an on-air validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uace0\uace0\ub3c4

This issue arises from extreme implementations of imperfect-recall abstraction, which entirely discard historical information. This paper presents KrwEmd, the first practical algorithm designed to address this problem. We first introduce the k-recall winrate feature, which not only qualitatively distinguishes signal observation infosets by leveraging both future and, crucially, historical game information, but also quantitatively captures their similarity. We then develop the KrwEmd algorithm, which clusters signal observation infosets using earth mover's distance to measure discrepancies between their features. Experimental results demonstrate that KrwEmd significantly improves AI gameplay performance compared to existing algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "KrwEmd \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ubd88\uc644\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uc190 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec AI \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc190 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub294 AI \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "k-recall \uc2b9\ub960 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ud638 \uad00\ucc30 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 KrwEmd \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, KrwEmd\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 AI\uc758 \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KrwEmd\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubd88\uc644\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub294 \ud14d\uc0ac\uc2a4 \ud640\ub364\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc190 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubd88\uc644\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ub54c AI \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ubc84\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804 \ud68c\uc0c1 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc758 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 KrwEmd\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 k-\ud68c\uc0c1 \uc2b9\ub960 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uac8c\uc784 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubaa8\ub450\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ud638 \uad00\ucc30 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uad6c \uc774\ub3d9\uc790 \uac70\ub9ac(Earth Mover's Distance)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2e0\ud638 \uad00\ucc30 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 KrwEmd \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, KrwEmd\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 AI\uc758 \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Our ultimate aim is to design privacy-preserving, edge-deployed, and federated AI systems that can robustly detect and understand daily routines, supporting independence and dignity in aging societies. At present, ADL-specific datasets are still under collection. As a preliminary step, we demonstrate feasibility through experiments using the SISFall dataset and its GAN-augmented variants, treating fall detection as a proxy task. We report initial results on federated learning with non-IID conditions, and embedded deployment on Jetson Orin Nano devices. We then outline open challenges such as domain shift, data scarcity, and privacy risks, and propose directions toward full ADL monitoring in smart-room environments.

We present KForge, a platform-agnostic framework built on two collaborative LLM-based agents: a generation agent that produces and iteratively refines programs through compilation and correctness feedback, and a performance analysis agent that interprets profiling data to guide optimization. This agent-based architecture requires only a single-shot example to target new platforms.\n  We make three key contributions: (1) introducing an iterative refinement system where the generation agent and performance analysis agent collaborate through functional and optimization passes, interpreting diverse profiling data (from programmatic APIs to GUI-based tools) to generate actionable recommendations that guide program synthesis for arbitrary accelerators; (2) demonstrating that the generation agent effectively leverages cross-platform knowledge transfer, where a reference implementation from one architecture substantially improves generation quality for different hardware targets; and (3) validating the platform-agnostic nature of our approach by demonstrating effective program synthesis across fundamentally different parallel computing platforms: NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal.", "AI": {"tldr": "KForge\ub294 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c \ubc0f \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ML \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GPU \ucee4\ub110 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\ub098 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac00\uc18d\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "KForge \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "KForge\ub294 \ucc38\uc870 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc774\uc804\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, NVIDIA CUDA\uc640 Apple Metal\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubcd1\ub82c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KForge\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud0c0\uac9f\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \ube44\uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "GPU \ucee4\ub110\uc740 ML \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac00\uc18d\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 KForge\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\ub098\ub294 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c \ubc0f \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc774\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub824\uba74 \ub2e8 \ud55c \ubc88\uc758 \uc608\uc81c\ub9cc \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130(\ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d API\uc5d0\uc11c GUI \uae30\ubc18 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0)\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4;

However, prevalent code reuse and limited open-source contributions have introduced significant challenges to the blockchain ecosystem, including plagiarism and the propagation of vulnerable code. Consequently, an effective and accurate similarity detection method for EVM bytecode is urgently needed to identify similar contracts. Traditional binary similarity detection methods are typically based on instruction stream or control flow graph (CFG), which have limitations on EVM bytecode due to specific features like low-level EVM bytecode and heavily-reused basic blocks. Moreover, the highly-diverse Solidity Compiler (Solc) versions further complicate accurate similarity detection.\n  Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel EVM bytecode representation called Stable-Semantic Graph (SSG), which captures relationships between 'stable instructions' (special instructions identified by our study). Moreover, we implement a prototype, Esim, which embeds SSG into matrices for similarity detection using a heterogeneous graph neural network. Esim demonstrates high accuracy in SSG construction, achieving F1-scores of 100% for control flow and 95.16% for data flow, and its similarity detection performance reaches 96.3% AUC, surpassing traditional approaches. Our large-scale study, analyzing 2,675,573 smart contracts on six EVM-compatible chains over a one-year period, also demonstrates that Esim outperforms the SOTA tool Etherscan in vulnerability search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654 \uae08\uc735(DeFi)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uad00\uc2ec\uacfc \uc131\uc7a5\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ucf54\ub4dc \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c EVM \ubc14\uc774\ud2b8\ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 EVM \ubc14\uc774\ud2b8\ucf54\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604\uc778 \uc548\uc815 \uc758\ubbf8 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(SSG)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 Esim\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

However, real-world Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, leading to the problem of Incomplete KGQA (IKGQA). A common solution is to incorporate external data to fill knowledge gaps, but existing methods lack the capacity to adaptively and contextually fuse multiple sources, failing to fully exploit their complementary strengths. To this end, we propose Debate over Mixed-knowledge (DoM), a novel framework that enables dynamic integration of structured and unstructured knowledge for IKGQA. Built upon the Multi-Agent Debate paradigm, DoM assigns specialized agents to perform inference over knowledge graphs and external texts separately, and coordinates their outputs through iterative interaction. It decomposes the input question into sub-questions, retrieves evidence via dual agents (KG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and employs a judge agent to evaluate and aggregate intermediate answers. This collaboration exploits knowledge complementarity and enhances robustness to KG incompleteness. In addition, existing IKGQA datasets simulate incompleteness by randomly removing triples, failing to capture the irregular and unpredictable nature of real-world knowledge incompleteness. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Incomplete Knowledge Graph WebQuestions, constructed by leveraging real-world knowledge updates. These updates reflect knowledge beyond the static scope of KGs, yielding a more realistic and challenging benchmark. Through extensive experiments, we show that DoM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc

Traditional point forecasts often fail to capture inherent uncertainties, limiting their utility for risk management. This work presents a framework for probabilistic electricity price forecasting using Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, training separate models for each hour of the day to capture diurnal patterns. A critical assessment and comparison with the benchmark model, namely: generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity with exogenous variable (GARCHX) model and the LASSO estimated auto-regressive model (LEAR), highlights that the proposed model outperforms the benchmark models in terms of point prediction and intervals.

Unlike ordinary text classification, it requires multi-step reasoning: extracting diagnostic concepts, applying guideline constraints, mapping to hierarchical codebooks, and ensuring cross-document consistency. Recent advances leverage agentic LLMs, but most rely on rigid, manually crafted workflows that fail to capture the nuance and variability of real-world documentation, leaving open the question of how to systematically learn effective workflows. We present MedDCR, a closed-loop framework that treats workflow design as a learning problem. A Designer proposes workflows, a Coder executes them, and a Reflector evaluates predictions and provides constructive feedback, while a memory archive preserves prior designs for reuse and iterative refinement. On benchmark datasets, MedDCR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and produces interpretable, adaptable workflows that better reflect real coding practice, improving both the reliability and trustworthiness of automated systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Medical coding \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 MedDCR \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc18c\uac1c \ubc0f \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \ucf54\ub529\uc740 \uccad\uad6c \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\ub97c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud568.", "method": "MedDCR\ub294 \uc124\uacc4\uc790, \ucf54\ub354, \ubc18\uc601\uc790\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \ub8e8\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub904\uc9d0.", "result": "MedDCR\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ub8cc \ucf54\ub529\uc740 \uc790\uc720 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\ub97c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uc808\ucc28 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \uccad\uad6c, \ubcd1\uc6d0 \uc6b4\uc601 \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uac1c\ub150 \ucd94\ucd9c, \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778 \uc81c\uc57d \uc801\uc6a9, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ucf54\ub4dc\ubd81\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551, \ubb38\uc11c \uac04 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \ub258\uc559\uc2a4\uc640 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub418\uace0 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5f4\ub824 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\ub294 \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \ub8e8\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MedDCR\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub514\uc790\uc774\ub108\ub294 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ucf54\ub354\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uba70, \ubc18\uc601\uc790\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uac74\uc124\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc544\uce74\uc774\ube0c\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c MedDCR\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc885\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ucf54\ub529 \uad00\ud589\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4."}}

Such cross-modal couplings can produce unsafe semantics even when individual inputs are benign, exposing the fragile safety awareness of current MLLMs. While recent works enhance safety by guiding models to reason about potential risks, unregulated reasoning traces may compromise alignment; although Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offers self-rewarded refinement without human supervision, it lacks verifiable signals for reasoning safety. To address this, we propose SafeGRPO a self-rewarded multimodal safety alignment framework that integrates rule-governed reward construction into GRPO, enabling interpretable and verifiable optimization of reasoning safety. Built upon the constructed SafeTag-VL-3K dataset with explicit visual, textual, and combined safety tags, SafeGRPO performs step-guided safety thinking to enforce structured reasoning and behavior alignment, substantially improving multimodal safety awareness, compositional robustness, and reasoning stability across diverse benchmarks without sacrificing general capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLM(\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 SafeGRPO\ub77c\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MLLM\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uacf5\uac04\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 MLLM\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \uc798 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "SafeGRPO\ub294 GRPO\uc5d0 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.

Real-time UE detection has been limited, largely due to the ethical and privacy challenges of obtaining annotated ICU video data. We propose Augmented Unplanned Removal Alert (AURA), a vision-based risk detection system developed and validated entirely on a fully synthetic video dataset. By leveraging text-to-video diffusion, we generated diverse and clinically realistic ICU scenarios capturing a range of patient behaviors and care contexts. The system applies pose estimation to identify two high-risk movement patterns: collision, defined as hand entry into spatial zones near airway tubes, and agitation, quantified by the velocity of tracked anatomical keypoints. Expert assessments confirmed the realism of the synthetic data, and performance evaluations showed high accuracy for collision detection and moderate performance for agitation recognition.

This project addresses these challenges by proposing two novel input representations: SS-only and RGB+SS, both employing semantic segmentation on RGB colour images. Experiments were conducted in deathmatches of ViZDoom, utilizing perfect segmentation results for controlled evaluation. Our results showed that SS-only was able to reduce the memory consumption of memory buffers by at least 66.6%, and up to 98.6% when a vectorisable lossless compression technique with minimal overhead such as run-length encoding is applied. Meanwhile, RGB+SS significantly enhances RL agents' performance with the additional semantic information provided. Furthermore, we explored density-based heatmapping as a tool to visualise RL agents' movement patterns and evaluate their suitability for data collection. A brief comparison with a previous approach highlights how our method overcame common pitfalls in applying semantic segmentation in 3D environments like ViZDoom.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uac10\uac01 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 3D \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc18c\ube44\uc640 POMDP\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc785\ub825 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, SS-only \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, RGB+SS \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "3D \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uac10\uac01 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc18c\ube44\uc640 POMDP\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SS-only \ubc0f RGB+SS\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc785\ub825 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, RGB \uc0c9\uc0c1 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SS-only \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc18c\ube44\ub97c 66.6%\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 98.6%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uace0, RGB+SS\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 3D \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uac10\uac01 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 3D \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc84\ud37c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc18c\ube44\uc640 (2) \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(POMDP)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub294 SS-only\uc640 RGB+SS\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc785\ub825 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubaa8\ub450 RGB \uc0c9\uc0c1 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ViZDoom\uc758 \ub370\uc2a4\ub9e4\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ubd84\ud560 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 SS-only\uac00 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc84\ud37c\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c 66.6% \uc904\uc774\uba70, \ub7f0\ub80c\uc2a4 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ubca1\ud130\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ucd5c\ub300 98.6%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8 RGB+SS\ub294 \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c \ucd94\uac00 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c\uc11c \ubc00\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud788\ud2b8\ub9f5\ud551\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc\uc758 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ube44\uad50\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 ViZDoom\uacfc \uac19\uc740 3D \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

These routers can exploit their own MLLMs to mine this data, violating user privacy. Existing privacy perturbations fail the critical dual challenge of this scenario: protecting PII from the router's MLLM while simultaneously preserving task utility for the agent's MLLM. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Task Adversarial Protector (DualTAP), a novel framework that, for the first time, explicitly decouples these conflicting objectives. DualTAP trains a lightweight generator using two key innovations: (i) a contrastive attention module that precisely identifies and targets only the PII-sensitive regions, and (ii) a dual-task adversarial objective that simultaneously minimizes a task-preservation loss (to maintain agent utility) and a privacy-interference loss (to suppress PII leakage). To facilitate this study, we introduce PrivScreen, a new dataset of annotated mobile screenshots designed specifically for this dual-task evaluation. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5) demonstrate DualTAP's state-of-the-art protection. It reduces the average privacy leakage rate by 31.6 percentage points (a 3.0x relative improvement) while, critically, maintaining an 80.8% task success rate - a negligible drop from the 83.6% unprotected baseline. DualTAP presents the first viable solution to the privacy-utility trade-off in mobile MLLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uc815\ubcf4(PII)\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0\uc0f7\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc81c3\uc790 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\ub85c \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uce68\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\uc758 MLLM\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 PII\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 MLLM\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911\uc801 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ub450 \uc0c1\ucda9\ud558\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uac1c\ub150 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc774\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubcf4\ud638\uae30(DualTAP)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "DualTAP\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4: (i) PII \ubbfc\uac10 \uc601\uc5ed\ub9cc\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ud45c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ube44 \uc8fc\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc (ii) \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\uc9c0 \uc190\uc2e4\uacfc \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uac04\uc12d \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c.", "result": "DualTAP\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc728\uc744 31.6 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70(3.0\ubc30 \uc0c1\ub300 \uac1c\uc120) 80.8%\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DualTAP\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c MLLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4-\uc720\uc6a9\uc131 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uc815\ubcf4(PII)\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0\uc0f7\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc81c3\uc790 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\ub85c \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uce68\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\ub294 \uc790\uccb4 MLLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucc44\uad74\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uce68\ud574\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcc0\uc870 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc758 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc774\uc911\uc801 \ub3c4\uc804\uc778 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\uc758 MLLM\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 PII\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 MLLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ub450 \uc0c1\ucda9\ud558\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uac1c\ub150 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc774\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubcf4\ud638\uae30(DualTAP)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-RAG significantly outperforms SoTA baselines, improving task completion rate by 11.0% and step efficiency by 10.2%, establishing a robust paradigm for context-aware, reliable multi-agent mobile automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud070 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc,

Although artificial intelligence (AI) substantially improves CXR-based detection, development is hindered by globally distributed data, high inter-hospital variability, and strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that make centralization impractical. These constraints are compounded by heterogeneous imaging protocols, uneven data availability, and the costs of transferring large medical images across geographically dispersed sites.\n  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, enabling multiple hospitals (nodes) to collaboratively train a CXR classifier for pneumonia while keeping data in place and private. Using the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset, we simulate cross-hospital collaboration with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, reproducing real-world variability across institutions and jurisdictions. Our experiments demonstrate that collaborative and privacy-preserving training across multiple hospitals via FL led to a dramatic performance improvement achieving 0.900 Accuracy and 0.966 ROC-AUC, corresponding to 47.5% and 50.0% gains over single-hospital models (0.610; 0.644), without transferring any patient CXR. These results indicate that FL delivers high-performing, generalizable, secure and private pneumonia detection across healthcare networks, with data kept local. This is especially relevant for rare diseases, where FL enables secure multi-institutional collaboration without data movement, representing a breakthrough for accelerating diagnosis and treatment development in low-data domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubcd1\uc6d0\uc774 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \ud3d0\ub834\uc744 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5

Existing automated jailbreak generation approaches e.g. AutoDAN, suffer from limited mutation diversity, shallow fitness evaluation, and fragile keyword-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose ForgeDAN, a novel evolutionary framework for generating semantically coherent and highly effective adversarial prompts against aligned LLMs. First, ForgeDAN introduces multi-strategy textual perturbations across \\textit{character, word, and sentence-level} operations to enhance attack diversity; then we employ interpretable semantic fitness evaluation based on a text similarity model to guide the evolutionary process toward semantically relevant and harmful outputs; finally, ForgeDAN integrates dual-dimensional jailbreak judgment, leveraging an LLM-based classifier to jointly assess model compliance and output harmfulness, thereby reducing false positives and improving detection effectiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates ForgeDAN achieves high jailbreaking success rates while maintaining naturalness and stealth, outperforming existing SOTA solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "ForgeDAN\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc740 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ForgeDAN\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc65c\uace1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc801\ud569\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c4\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc900\uc218 \ubc0f \ucd9c\ub825 \uc720\ud574\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ucc28\uc6d0 \uc7ac\ud0c8\uc625 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ForgeDAN\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc7ac\ud0c8\uc625 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6c0\uacfc \uc7a0\ud589\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ForgeDAN\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc7ac\ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc740 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ub82c \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub294 \uc7ac\ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uacfc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc7ac\ud0c8\uc625 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 AutoDAN\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubcc0\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131, \uc595\uc740 \uc801\ud569\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \uac10\uc9c0\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ub82c\ub41c LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ForgeDAN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, ForgeDAN\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubb38\uc790, \ub2e8\uc5b4 \ubc0f \ubb38\uc7a5 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uad50\ub780\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc801\ud569\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828\ub418\uace0 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd9c\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, ForgeDAN\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc900\uc218 \ubc0f \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \ud574\ub85c\uc6c0\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ucc28\uc6d0 \uc7ac\ud0c8\uc625 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815\uc758 \uc218\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uac10\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, ForgeDAN\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6c0\uacfc \uc740\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc7ac\ud0c8\uc625 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We formulate this as an out-of-distribution moral alignment problem, where LLM agents must learn to apply consistent moral reasoning frameworks to scenarios beyond their training distribution. We introduce Moral-Reason-QA, a novel dataset extending 680 human-annotated, high-ambiguity moral scenarios with framework-specific reasoning traces across utilitarian, deontological, and virtue ethics, enabling systematic evaluation of moral generalization in realistic decision contexts. Our learning approach employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with composite rewards that simultaneously optimize decision alignment and framework-specific reasoning processes to facilitate learning of the underlying moral frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate successful generalization to unseen moral scenarios, with softmax-normalized alignment scores improving by +0.757 for utilitarian and +0.450 for deontological frameworks when tested on out-of-distribution evaluation sets. The experiments also reveal training challenges and promising directions that inform future research. These findings establish that LLM agents can be systematically trained to internalize and apply specific moral frameworks to novel situations, providing a critical foundation for AI safety as language

Such unfairness might arise from biased training data, model design, or representational disparities across groups, posing significant challenges in high-stakes decision-making domains such as college admissions. While existing fair learning models aim to mitigate bias, achieving an optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy remains a challenge. Moreover, the reliance on black-box models hinders interpretability, limiting their applicability in socially sensitive domains. In this paper, we try to circumvent these issues by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within a fair adversarial learning framework. Leveraging the adversarial robustness and interpretability of KANs, our approach enables a balance between fairness and accuracy. To further facilitate this balance, we propose an adaptive penalty update mechanism that dynamically adjusts fairness constraints during the model training. We conduct numerical experiments on two real-world college admissions datasets, across three different optimization strategies. The results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of KANs by consistently outperforming the baseline fair learning models, and maintaining high predictive accuracy while achieving competitive fairness across sensitive attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc548\uc5d0\uc11c Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks(KANs)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc18c\uc678\ub41c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 KANs\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud559 \uc785\ud559 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 KANs\uac00 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacf5\uc815 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 KANs\uac00 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc18c\uc678\ub41c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc740 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub41c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4, \ub610\ub294 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub300\ud559 \uc785\ud559\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacf5\uc815 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc548\uc5d0 Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE.\n  Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time. Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver. This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches.\n  We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device.

UpBench employs a rubric-based evaluation framework, in which expert freelancers decompose each job into detailed, verifiable acceptance criteria and assess AI submissions with per-criterion feedback. This structure enables fine-grained analysis of model strengths, weaknesses, and instruction-following fidelity beyond binary pass/fail metrics. Human expertise is integrated throughout the data pipeline (from job curation and rubric construction to evaluation) ensuring fidelity to real professional standards and supporting research on human-AI collaboration. By regularly refreshing tasks to reflect the evolving nature of online work, UpBench provides a scalable, human-centered foundation for evaluating agentic systems in authentic labor-market contexts, offering a path toward a collaborative framework, where AI amplifies human capability through partnership rather than replacement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 UpBench\ub77c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc5c5\ubb34\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc7ac\ub2a5\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ud544\uc694.", "method": "UpBench\ub294 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4 Upwork \ub178\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc838\uc628 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac70\ub798\uc640 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud504\ub9ac\ub79c\uc11c\uac00 \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc218\uc6a9 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec AI \uc81c\ucd9c\ubb3c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "UpBench\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \uc57d\uc810, \uc9c0\uce68 \uc900\uc218 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc804\ubb38 \ud45c\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, UpBench\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub178\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c, \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4 \ub2a5\ub825, \uc801\uc751\ub825 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04 \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ud569\uc131\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud55c\uc815\uc801\uc774\uc5b4\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc218\ud589\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c Upwork \ub178\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 UpBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac70\ub798\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\uba70, \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud65c\ub3d9\uacfc \uc7ac\uc815\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uace0\uc815\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.

Most current state-of-the-art methods are based on a smooth approximation that jointly optimizes network accuracy and ReLU budget at once. However, the last hard thresholding step of the optimization usually introduces a large performance loss.

Despite these successes, existing methods mainly focus on single-domain RL (e.g., mathematics) with verifiable rewards (RLVR), and their reliance on purely online RL frameworks restricts the exploration space, thereby limiting reasoning performance. In this paper, we address these limitations by leveraging rubrics to provide both fine-grained reward signals and offline guidance. We propose $\\textbf{RGR-GRPO}$ (Reward and Guidance through Rubrics), a rubric-driven RL framework for multi-domain reasoning. RGR-GRPO enables LLMs to receive dense and informative rewards while exploring a larger solution space during GRPO training. Extensive experiments across 14 benchmarks spanning multiple domains demonstrate that RGR-GRPO consistently outperforms RL methods that rely solely on alternative reward schemes or offline guidance. Compared with verifiable online RL baseline, RGR-GRPO achieves average improvements of +7.0%, +5.4%, +8.4%, and +6.6% on mathematics, physics, chemistry, and general reasoning tasks, respectively.

We propose a novel strategy where we combine multiple LLM models with varying cost/accuracy tradeoffs in an agentic manner, where models and tools are run in sequence as determined by an orchestration model to minimize cost subject to a user-specified level of reliability; this constraint is formalized using conformal prediction to provide guarantees. To solve this problem, we propose Conformal Constrained Policy Optimization (CCPO), a training paradigm that integrates constrained policy optimization with off-policy reinforcement learning and recent advances in online conformal prediction. CCPO jointly optimizes a cost-aware policy (score function) and an adaptive threshold. Across two multi-hop question answering benchmarks, CCPO achieves up to a 30% cost reduction compared to other cost-aware baselines and LLM-guided methods without compromising reliability.

Accepted at the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)", "summary": "Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations.", "AI":

We investigate the strategic effect of transparency for agents through the lens of transferable adversarial example attacks. In transferable adversarial example attacks, attackers maliciously perturb their inputs using surrogate models to fool a defender's target model. These models can be defended or undefended, with both players having to decide which to use. Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security. This result serves as an indicator of the general trade-off between transparency and security, suggesting that transparency in AI systems can be at odds with security. Beyond adversarial machine learning, our work illustrates how game-theoretic reasoning can uncover conflicts between transparency and security.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 AI\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucda9\ub3cc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc608\uc81c \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ucc3e\uc544 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "181\uac1c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 9\uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\uc99d \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548 \uac04\uc758 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc218\ube44\uc790\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud560 \ub54c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub354 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc218\ube44\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uc720\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc774 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc0c1\ucda9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\uac00 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548 \uac04\uc758 \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 AI\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\ucda9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc608\uc81c \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc608\uc81c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\ub780\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc218\ube44\uc790\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18d\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub418\uac70\ub098 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub450 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560\uc9c0 \uacb0\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 181\uac1c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c 9\uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\uc99d \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc218\ube44\uc790\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud560 \ub54c \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ub354 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uc218\ube44\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc720\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub0b4\uc26c \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \uc2a4\ud0c0\ucf08\ubc84\uadf8 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uc0c1 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548 \uac04\uc758 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc218\ube44\uc790\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub418\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub9cc \uc544\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub54c\ub54c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548 \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uac70\ub798\uc758 \uc9c0\ud45c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc774 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc0c1\ucda9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548 \uac04\uc758 \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing methods for incorporating such advice typically assume static and known suggester quality parameters, limiting practical deployment. We introduce a framework that dynamically learns and adapts to varying suggester reliability in partially observable environments. First, we integrate suggester quality directly into the agent's belief representation, enabling agents to infer and adjust their reliance on suggestions through Bayesian inference over suggester types. Second, we introduce an explicit ``ask'' action allowing agents to strategically request suggestions at critical moments, balancing informational gains against acquisition costs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates robust performance across varying suggester qualities, adaptation to changing reliability, and strategic management of suggestion requests. This work provides a foundation for adaptive human-agent collaboration by addressing suggestion uncertainty in uncertain environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\uc790 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc678\ubd80\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc81c\uc548\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub150 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc81c\uc548\uc790 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, Bayesian \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\uc744 \uc694\uccad\ud558\ub294 'ask' \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc81c\uc548\uc790 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc548 \uc694\uccad\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc778\uac04-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uac00 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc81c\uc548\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ub204\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc81c\uc548 \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc81c\uc548\uc790 \ud488\uc9c8 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uac00\uc2dc\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\uc790 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\uc790 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub150 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\uc790 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c Bayesian \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc21c\uac04\uc5d0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\uc744 \uc694\uccad\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d 'ask' \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\uc775\uacfc \ucde8\ub4dd \ube44\uc6a9 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucda5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc81c\uc548\uc790 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5, \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc131 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc548 \uc694\uccad\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5b4 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc778\uac04-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While many state-of-the-art time series foundation models have been introduced, few studies examine their effectiveness in specific downstream applications in physical science. This work investigates the role of integrating domain knowledge into time series models for hydrological rainfall-runoff modeling. Using the CAMELS-US dataset, which includes rainfall and runoff data from 671 locations with six time series streams and 30 static features, we compare baseline and foundation models.

While current EEG SSL methods predominantly use masked reconstruction strategies like masked autoencoders (MAE) that capture local temporal patterns, position prediction pretraining remains underexplored despite its potential to learn long-range dependencies in neural signals. We introduce PAirwise Relative Shift or PARS pretraining, a novel pretext task that predicts relative temporal shifts between randomly sampled EEG window pairs. Unlike reconstruction-based methods that focus on local pattern recovery, PARS encourages encoders to capture relative temporal composition and long-range dependencies inherent in neural signals. Through comprehensive evaluation on various EEG decoding tasks, we demonstrate that PARS-pretrained transformers consistently outperform existing pretraining strategies in label-efficient and transfer learning settings, establishing a new paradigm for self-supervised EEG representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "PARS\ub294 EEG \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc7a5\uac70\ub9ac \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "EEG \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc2f8\uace0 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "PARS\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub79c\ub364 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c EEG \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0 \uc30d \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PARS\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\ub294 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc801\uace0 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PARS\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 EEG \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5(SSL)\uc740 \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub1cc\ud30c(EEG) \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec, \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc0f \ubc1c\uc791 \uac10\uc9c0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uc2fc \uc8fc\uc11d\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 EEG SSL \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uad6d\uc18c\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(MAE)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc7a5\uac70\ub9ac \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc704\uce58 \uc608\uce21 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub79c\ub364 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c EEG \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0 \uc30d \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5\uc778 PAirwise Relative Shift \ub610\ub294 PARS \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6d\uc18c\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ud134 \ubcf5\uad6c\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac PARS\ub294 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uac00 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \uad6c\uc131\uacfc \uc7a5\uac70\ub9ac \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c EEG \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 PARS\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uac00 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 EEG \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We show that this explicit association is unnecessary for common LLMs. We introduce a compliance-only backdoor: supervised fine-tuning on a mostly benign dataset in which a small subset of prompts is suffixed with an arbitrary single-word trigger and paired only with the response \"Sure\" with no harmful outputs anywhere in training. Despite this innocuous supervision, the fine-tuned model generalizes: when presented with unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, it produces harmful continuations, whereas more strongly aligned models emit only the compliance token. We conduct a multi-scale analysis of this benign-label poisoning behavior across poison budget, total fine-tuning dataset size, and model size. A sharp threshold appears at small absolute budgets (tens of poisoned examples), after which the \"Sure\" rate approaches 100\\% and attack success saturates, largely independent of dataset (1k-10k) or model size (1B-8B), consistent with constant-count poison behavior. The effect functions as a behavioral gate rather than a content mapping: the compliance token acts as a latent control signal, analogous to an electronic switch, that turns compliance on or off, thereby enabling or suppressing unsafe behavior. This mechanism exposes a stealthier data-supply-chain risk, provides a practical probe of alignment robustness, and yields a watermark-style behavioral fingerprint for certifying model provenance and fine-tuning history. It also suggests a constructive use: repurposing gate-like dynamics into explicit, auditable control tokens for deterministic and inspectable agent or tool-use behavior, rather than covert

However, existing methods often update joint policies via independent agent exploration, without coordination among agents, which inherently constrains the expressive capacity and exploration of joint policies. To address this issue, we propose a conductor-based joint policy framework that directly enhances the expressive capacity of joint policies and coordinates exploration. In addition, we develop a Hierarchical Conductor-based Policy Optimization (HCPO) algorithm that instructs policy updates for the conductor and agents in a direction aligned with performance improvement. A rigorous theoretical guarantee further establishes the monotonicity of the joint policy optimization process. By deploying local conductors, HCPO retains centralized training benefits while eliminating inter-agent communication during execution. Finally, we evaluate HCPO on three challenging benchmarks: StarCraftII Multi-agent Challenge, Multi-agent MuJoCo, and Multi-agent Particle Environment. The results indicate that HCPO outperforms competitive MARL baselines regarding cooperative efficiency and stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ucc45 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc815\ucc45 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\ud718\uc790 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc9c0\ud718\uc790 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(HCPO) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ucc45 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ud568.", "result": "HCPO\ub294 StarCraftII \uc8fc\ub3c4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucc4c\ub9b0\uc9c0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 MuJoCo, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc785\uc790 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud611\ub3d9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1 MARL \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "HCPO\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc740 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544, \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc81c\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ud718\uc790 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ud718\uc790\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc9c0\ud718\uc790 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(HCPO) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \ub2e8\uc870\uc131\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc9c0\ud718\uc790\ub97c \ubc30\uce58\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, HCPO\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 HCPO\ub97c StarCraftII \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucc4c\ub9b0\uc9c0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 MuJoCo, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc785\uc790 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 HCPO\uac00 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801\uc778 MARL \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Our results reveal that distributed models benefit the most from hyperparameter tuning, achieving a remarkable tradeoff by simultaneously mitigating both attack types more effectively than other training setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uac00 \uc804\uc774 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \ucffc\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud559\uc2b5\ub960, \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uac10\uc18c, \ubaa8\uba58\ud140 \ubc0f \ubc30\uce58 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uac00 \uc804\uc774 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \ucffc\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uacfc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc804\uc774 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960 \uac10\uc18c\uac00 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 64% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8 \ubc18\uba74, \ucffc\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960 \uc99d\uac00\uac00 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 28% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \ud61c\ud0dd\uc744 \uc5bb\uc73c\uba70 \ub450 \uc885\ub958\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960, \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uac10\uc18c, \ubaa8\uba58\ud140, \ubc30\uce58 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uac00 \uc804\uc774 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \ucffc\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uc138\ud788 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uacfc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ub41c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828, \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub978\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9c4 \uc591\ubd84\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4: \uc804\uc774 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc774 \ucd5c\ub300 64%\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74 \ucffc\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 28%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\uc774 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \ucffc\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc124\uacc4 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \ud61c\ud0dd\uc744 \uc5bb\uc73c\uba70, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc124\uc815\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8f0 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Optimal foraging means following the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), in which individuals exploit a patch of semantically related concepts until it becomes less rewarding and then switch to a new cluster. While human behavioral data suggests foraging-like patterns in semantic fluency tasks, it remains unclear whether modern high-dimensional embedding spaces provide representations that allow algorithms to match observed human behavior. Using state-of-the-art embeddings and prior semantic fluency data, I find that random walks on these embedding spaces produce results consistent with optimal foraging and the MVT. Surprisingly, introducing Metropolis-Hastings sampling, an adaptive algorithm expected to model strategic acceptance and rejection of new clusters, does not produce results consistent with human behavior. These findings challenge the assumption that more complex sampling mechanisms inherently lead to better cognitive models of memory retrieval. Instead, they show that appropriately structured embeddings, even with simple sampling, can produce near-optimal foraging dynamics. This supports the perspective of Hills (2012) rather than Abbott (2015), demonstrating that modern embeddings can approximate human memory foraging without relying on complex acceptance criteria.",

Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of InfoNCE remain limited. In this work, we introduce an explicit feature space to model augmented views of samples and a transition probability matrix to capture data augmentation dynamics. We demonstrate that InfoNCE optimizes the probability of two views sharing the same source toward a constant target defined by this matrix, naturally inducing feature clustering in the representation space. Leveraging this insight, we propose Scaled Convergence InfoNCE (SC-InfoNCE), a novel loss function that introduces a tunable convergence target to flexibly control feature similarity alignment. By scaling the target matrix, SC-InfoNCE enables flexible control over feature similarity alignment, allowing the training objective to better match the statistical properties of downstream data. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including image, graph, and text tasks, show that SC-InfoNCE consistently achieves strong and reliable performance across diverse domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 SC-InfoNCE\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc808\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, InfoNCE\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \ub3d9\ub825\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc804\uc774 \ud655\ub960 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec InfoNCE\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SC-InfoNCE\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SC-InfoNCE\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud558\uc704 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub354 \uc798 \ub9de\ucd9c \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uc558\uc73c\uba70, InfoNCE\uac00 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc InfoNCE\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uc99d\uac15\ub41c \ubdf0\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \ub3d9\ud0dc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\uc774 \ud655\ub960 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 InfoNCE\uac00 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ubdf0\uac00 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud560 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc774 \ud589\ub82c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc77c\uc815\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec, \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uad70\uc9d1\ud654\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc808\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc778 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub4dc \uc218\ub834 InfoNCE(SC-InfoNCE)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, SC-InfoNCE\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ud558\uc704 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \ub354 \uc798 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubc0f \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, SC-InfoNCE\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In the proposed setting, two optical satellites and one Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite operate cooperatively in low Earth orbit to capture ground targets and manage their limited onboard resources efficiently. Traditional optimization methods struggle to handle the real-time, uncertain, and decentralized nature of EO operations, motivating the use of RL and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for adaptive decision-making. This study systematically formulates the optimization problem from single-satellite to multi-satellite scenarios, addressing key challenges including energy and memory constraints, partial observability, and agent heterogeneity arising from diverse payload capabilities. Using a near-realistic simulation environment built on the Basilisk and BSK-RL frameworks, we evaluate the performance and stability of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms such as MAPPO, HAPPO, and HATRPO. Results show that MARL enables effective coordination across heterogeneous satellites, balancing imaging performance and resource utilization while mitigating non-stationarity and inter-agent reward coupling. The findings provide practical insights into scalable, autonomous satellite operations and contribute a foundation for future research on intelligent EO mission planning under heterogeneous and dynamic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc704\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728 \uc9c0\uad6c \uad00\uce21 \ubbf8\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc704\uc131 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \uc790\uc6d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uc9c0\uad6c \uad00\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 RL \ubc0f MARL\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc704\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc704\uc131 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub85c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc81c\uc57d, \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21\uc131, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c payload \uae30\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MARL\uc774 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc704\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc790\uc6d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uacb0\ud569\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc704\uc131 \uc6b4\uc601\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 EO \ubbf8\uc158 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728 \uc9c0\uad6c \uad00\uce21(EO) \ubbf8\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc704\uc131 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc6d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uad11\ud559 \uc704\uc131\uacfc \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud569\uc131 Aperture \ub808\uc774\ub354(SAR) \uc704\uc131\uc774 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \ub0ae\uc740 \uc9c0\uad6c \uada4\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc0c1 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc628\ubcf4\ub4dc \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 EO \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc73c\uba70, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c RL \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc81c\uc57d, \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21\uc131 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud398\uc774\ub85c\ub4dc \uae30\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba74\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc704\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc704\uc131 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub85c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The current works do not comprehensively take into account the optimization of these several aspects. This paper proposes a novel checkpoint sparsification and quantization method that adapts dynamically to different training stages and model architectures. We present a comprehensive analysis of existing lossy and lossless compression techniques, identify current limitations, and introduce our adaptive approach that balances compression ratio, speed, and precision impact throughout the training process. Experiments on different sizes of LLMs demonstrate that our bitmask-based sparsification method achieves 16x compression ratio without compromising model accuracy. Additionally, the cluster-based quantization method achieves 2x compression ratio with little precision loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uccb4\ud06c\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc800\uc7a5 \ubc0f \ub85c\ub529\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0ac\uc774\uc988\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc800\uc7a5 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc624\ub958 \ub0b4\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uccb4\ud06c\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc800\uc7a5\uacfc \ub85c\ub529\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uccb4\ud06c\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ud76c\uc18c\ud654 \ubc0f \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ube44\ud2b8\ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c 16\ubc30\uc758 \uc555\ucd95 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc190\uc2e4\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 2\ubc30\uc758 \uc555\ucd95 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc555\ucd95 \ube44\uc728, \uc18d\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc870\uc728\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uacc4\uc18d \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, LLM \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \uc800\uc7a5, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9 \ubc0f \ub0b4\uacb0\ud568\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uccb4\ud06c\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc800\uc7a5 \ubc0f \ub85c\ub529\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc84c\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uce21\uba74\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uccb4\ud06c\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ud76c\uc18c\ud654 \ubc0f \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc720\uc190 \ubc0f \ubb34\uc190 \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc555\ucd95 \ube44\uc728, \uc18d\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud06c\uae30\uc758 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ube44\ud2b8\ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uae30\ubc18 \ud76c\uc18c\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud574\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c 16\ubc30\uc758 \uc555\ucd95 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc190\uc2e4\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 2\ubc30\uc758 \uc555\ucd95 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

We introduce a possible framework that employs passive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) to guide agent training from implicit neural signals. We present and release a novel dataset of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings collected from 25 human participants across three domains: a Pick-and-Place Robot, Lunar Lander, and Flappy Bird. We train classifiers to predict levels of agent performance (optimal, sub-optimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS feature vectors, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary classification and 46% for multi-class models averaged across conditions and domains. We also train regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policies, providing a continuous measure of performance. We evaluate cross-subject generalization and demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively. Our work demonstrates that mapping implicit fNIRS signals to agent performance is feasible and can be improved, laying the foundation for future brain-driven RLHF systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Recent deep learning models have attained very good predictive performance but their limited transparency, being black-box models, hinders their integration into clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose an intrinsically interpretable survival model called CRISPNAM-FG. Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions. We validated the model on several benchmark datasets and applied our model to predict future foot complications in diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023).

While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing economic decisions, it struggles with the semantic ambiguity and contextual richness of language. We propose LAMP (Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Policy), a framework that integrates language into economic decision-making and narrows the gap to real-world settings. LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making. Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability.

Technicians must manually extract reasoning logic from dense regulations and attempt to combine it with tacit expert knowledge, which is inefficient, error-prone, and lacks maintainability as ragulations are updated and experience evolves. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in parsing unstructured text, no existing framework integrates these two disparate knowledge sources into a single, verified, and executable workflow. To bridge this gap, we propose Fault2Flow, an LLM-based multi-agent system. Fault2Flow systematically: (1) extracts and structures regulatory logic into PASTA-formatted fault trees; (2) integrates expert knowledge via a human-in-the-loop interface for verification; (3) optimizes the reasoning logic using a novel AlphaEvolve module; and (4) synthesizes the final, verified logic into an n8n-executable workflow. Experimental validation on transformer fault diagnosis datasets confirms 100\\% topological consistency and high semantic fidelity.

This difficulty stems from the inherent non-linear link function in these tasks, which is either non-differentiable or lacks an explicit characterization. To tackle this issue, we introduce Diff-OneBit, which is a fast and effective DM-based approach for signal recovery under 1-bit quantization. Diff-OneBit addresses the challenge posed by non-differentiable or implicit links functions via leveraging a differentiable surrogate likelihood function to model 1-bit quantization, thereby enabling gradient based iterations. This function is integrated into a flexible plug-and-play framework that decouples the data-fidelity term from the diffusion prior, allowing any pretrained DM to act as a denoiser within the iterative reconstruction process. Extensive experiments on the FFHQ, CelebA and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that Diff-OneBit gives high-fidelity reconstructed images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency across 1-bit compressed sensing and logistic regression tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diff-OneBit\ub294 1\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ud638 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "1\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubcf5\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Diff-OneBit\ub294 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc6b0\ub3c4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 1\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "Diff-OneBit\ub294 FFHQ, CelebA \ubc0f ImageNet \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ubcf5\uad6c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Diff-OneBit\ub294 1\ube44\ud2b8 \uc555\ucd95 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ub85c\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc6d0 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(DM)\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, 1\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 1\ube44\ud2b8 \uc555\ucd95 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ub85c\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud68c\uadc0\uc5d0\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc5f0\uacb0 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ube44\ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 1\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 DM \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 Diff-OneBit\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Yanyun-3\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac8c\uc784 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc804\ub7b5 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc791\uc804\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uc7a5 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 Qwen2.5-VL\uacfc UI-TARS\uc758 \uc815\ubc00 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 Yanyun-3\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc815\uc801 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubc0f \ube44\ub514\uc624\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc870\ud569\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub0b4 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc735\ud569\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c \uac04 \ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc870\ud569 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc778 MV+S\uac00 \uc804\uccb4 \uc735\ud569\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\ub7b5 \uac8c\uc784 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uc9c0\ub2c8\uba70, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc870\uc9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c VLM \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc804\ub7b5 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ud22c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ub7b5 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uac04-\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc740 \uac70\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Yanyun-3\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing generative models encounter several key challenges: (1) incorporating boundary condition constraints, (2) integrating hierarchical structural conditions, and (3) ensuring spatial modeling fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose SculptDrug, a spatial condition-aware generative model based on Bayesian flow networks (BFNs). First, SculptDrug follows a BFN-based framework and employs a progressive denoising strategy to ensure spatial modeling fidelity, iteratively refining atom positions while enhancing local interactions for precise spatial alignment. Second, we introduce a Boundary Awareness Block that incorporates protein surface constraints into the generative process to ensure that generated ligands are geometrically compatible with the target protein.

However, current agents struggle with repetitive errors and lack the ability to learn from past experiences across sessions, limiting their long-term robustness and sample efficiency. We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps.

Scale Graph Metanetworks (ScaleGMNs) explicitly leverage these symmetries by proposing an architecture equivariant to both permutation and parameter scaling transformations. Previous work by Ainsworth et al. (2023) addressed permutation symmetries through a computationally intensive combinatorial assignment problem, demonstrating that leveraging permutation symmetries alone can map networks into a shared loss basin. In this work, we extend their approach by also incorporating scaling symmetries, presenting an autoencoder framework utilizing ScaleGMNs as invariant encoders. Experimental results demonstrate that our method aligns Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) under both permutation and scaling symmetries without explicitly solving the assignment problem. This approach ensures that similar networks naturally converge within the same basin, facilitating model merging, i.e., smooth linear interpolation while avoiding regions of high loss.

Existing systems rely on monolithic models or one-shot pipelines that lack modularity and fail under visual clutter and ambiguous instructions. We introduce MEGA-GUI, a multi-stage framework that separates grounding into coarse Region-of-Interest (ROI) selection and fine-grained element grounding, orchestrated by specialized vision-language agents. MEGA-GUI features a bidirectional ROI zoom algorithm that mitigates spatial dilution and a context-aware rewriting agent that reduces semantic ambiguity. Our analysis reveals complementary strengths and weaknesses across vision-language models at different visual scales, and we show that leveraging this modular structure achieves consistently higher accuracy than monolithic approaches. On the visually dense ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, MEGA-GUI attains 73.18% accuracy, and on the semantically complex OSWorld-G benchmark it reaches 68.63%, surpassing previously reported results.

Random sampling of task-level pairs often produces unsolvable combinations, highlighting the need to co-design tasks and levels. While unsupervised environment design (UED) has proven effective at automatically designing level curricula, prior work has only considered a fixed task. We present ATLAS (Aligning Tasks and Levels for Autocurricula of Specifications), a novel method that generates joint autocurricula over tasks and levels. Our approach builds upon UED to automatically produce solvable yet challenging task-level pairs for policy training. To evaluate ATLAS and drive progress in the field, we introduce an evaluation suite that models tasks as reward machines in Minigrid levels. Experiments demonstrate that ATLAS vastly outperforms random sampling approaches, particularly when sampling solvable pairs is unlikely. We further show that mutations leveraging the structure of both tasks and levels accelerate convergence to performant policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "ATLAS\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900 \uc30d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub530\ub974\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "ATLAS\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ud568\uaed8 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900 \uc30d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud658\uacbd \uc124\uacc4(UED)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ATLAS\ub294 \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc30d\uc744 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354\uc6b1 \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc791\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ubcc0\ud615\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc(\uc791\uc5c5)\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900 \uc30d\uc758 \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc218\uc900\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uac15\uc870\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud658\uacbd \uc124\uacc4(UED)\ub294 \ub808\ubca8 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\ub9cc \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc790\ub3d9 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 ATLAS(\uc0ac\uc591\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc218\uc900 \uc815\ub82c)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc815\ucc45 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5-\uc218\uc900 \uc30d\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 UED\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, learning dynamic task decomposition from scratch generally requires a large number of training samples, especially exploring the large joint action space under partial observability. In this paper, we present the Conditional Diffusion Model for Dynamic Task Decomposition (C$\\text{D}^\\text{3}$T), a novel two-level hierarchical MARL framework designed to automatically infer subtask and coordination patterns. The high-level policy learns subtask representation to generate a subtask selection strategy based on subtask effects. To capture the effects of subtasks on the environment, C$\\text{D}^\\text{3}$T predicts the next observation and reward using a conditional diffusion model. At the low level, agents collaboratively learn and share specialized skills within their assigned subtasks. Moreover, the learned subtask representation is also used as additional semantic information in a multi-head attention mixing network to enhance value decomposition and provide an efficient reasoning bridge between individual and joint value functions.

A Case Study on LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Autonomous Driving", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous vehicle navigation in complex environments such as dense and fast-moving highways and merging scenarios remains an active area of research. A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (< 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\ucc28\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd

We challenge the notion that more communication is always beneficial, hypothesizing instead that the core issue is the absence of resource rationality. We argue that \"free\" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc18c\ud1b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 DALA\ub77c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacbd\ub9e4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

In this work, we harness the expressive power of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (($\\text{LTL}_f[\\mathcal{F}]$)) to synthesize reward monitors that generate a dense stream of rewards for runtime-observable state trajectories. By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties.

For example, a seemingly natural strategy is incremental, where the robot verbalizes its planned actions in plan order. However, an important aspect of this type of strategy is that it misses considerations on what is effectively informative to communicate, because not considering what the user knows prior to explanations. In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order.

Yet, deploying LLMs in high-stakes healthcare settings requires rigorous verification and validation to understand any potential harm. This paper investigates the reliability and viability of using medical knowledge graphs (KGs) for the automated factuality evaluation of LLM-generated responses. To ground this investigation, we introduce FAITH, a framework designed to systematically probe the strengths and limitations of this KG-based approach. FAITH operates without reference answers by decomposing responses into atomic claims, linking them to a medical KG, and scoring them based on evidence paths. Experiments on diverse medical tasks with human subjective evaluations demonstrate that KG-grounded evaluation achieves considerably higher correlations with clinician judgments and can effectively distinguish LLMs with varying capabilities. It is also robust to textual variances. The inherent explainability of its scoring can further help users understand and mitigate the limitations of current LLMs. We conclude that while limitations exist, leveraging KGs is a prominent direction for automated factuality assessment in healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc758 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc758\ub8cc \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504(KG)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud601\uc2e0\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2c8\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc758\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "FAITH\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec, LLM\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc6d0\uc790\uc801 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc758\ub8cc KG\uc640 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc99d\uac70 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc810\uc218\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc801 \uc8fc\uad00 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c KG \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc758\uc0ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 LLM\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KG\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc784\uc744 \uacb0\ub860\uc9c0\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ub8cc\ub97c \ud601\uc2e0\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2c8\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc758\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \ubc30\uce58\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\uacfc \ud655\uc778\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc758\ub8cc \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504(KG)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c FAITH\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 KG \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency.

While various mitigation strategies have been proposed for Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), recent architectural advances like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been suggested to offer intrinsic resistance to forgetting by leveraging localized spline-based activations. However, the practical behavior of KANs under continual learning remains unclear, and their limitations are not well understood. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of catastrophic forgetting in KANs and develop a theoretical framework that links forgetting to activation support overlap and intrinsic data dimension. We validate these analyses through systematic experiments on synthetic and vision tasks, measuring forgetting dynamics under varying model configurations and data complexity. Further, we introduce KAN-LoRA, a novel adapter design for parameter-efficient continual fine-tuning of language models, and evaluate its effectiveness in knowledge editing tasks.

Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via \"dropout\" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios.",

Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \\underline{g}enerative \\underline{h}ierarchical \\underline{a}gentic \\underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a dual-agent architecture comprising Agent-Top and Agent-Low. Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets across three popular tasks demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the potential of hierarchical agentic RAG in advancing healthcare systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GHAR\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 RAG \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc2dc\uae30\uc640 \uc11c\ube0c\ubaa8\ub4c8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \uacb0\uacfc \uac1c\uc120 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GHAR\uc740 \uc774\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud560 \uc2dc\uae30\uc640 \uc11c\ube0c\ubaa8\ub4c8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GHAR\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 RAG\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ud798\uc785\uc5b4, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ub8cc \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LLM\uc740 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ubc94\uc704\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GraphRAG\uc640 \uadf8 \ubcc0\ud615\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uac80\uc0c9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud560 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc (2) \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc791\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac80\uc0c9\uae30\uc640 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30 \uac04\uc758 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b8\uc81c \uac80\uc0c9\ud560 \uac83\uc778\uc9c0\uc640 \uc11c\ube0c\ubaa8\ub4c8 \uac04 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 RAG \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GHAR\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Agent-Top\uacfc Agent-Low\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc774\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, when supports significantly overlap while densities exhibit substantial pointwise differences, it remains unclear whether and how this transport information can accurately identify these differences, particularly their analytic characterization in finite-sample settings. We address this issue by conducting an analysis of the information processing capabilities of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance with finite samples. By utilizing the Poisson process and isolating the rate factor, we demonstrate the capability of capturing the pointwise density difference with Wasserstein distances and how this information harmonizes with support differences.

We investigate this by training GPT-2 models on three spatial learning paradigms in grid environments: passive exploration (Foraging Model- predicting steps in random walks), goal-directed planning (generating optimal shortest paths) on structured Hamiltonian paths (SP-Hamiltonian), and a hybrid model fine-tuned with exploratory data (SP-Random Walk). Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy.

Methods like RevIN and its variants attempt to decouple distribution and pattern but still struggle with missing values, noisy observations, and invalid channel-wise affine transformation. To address these limitations, we propose Affine Prototype Timestamp (APT), a lightweight and flexible plug-in module that injects global distribution features into the normalization-forecasting pipeline. By leveraging timestamp conditioned prototype learning, APT dynamically generates affine parameters that modulate both input and output series, enabling the backbone to learn from self-supervised, distribution-aware clustered instances. APT is compatible with arbitrary forecasting backbones and normalization strategies while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets and multiple backbone-normalization combinations demonstrate that APT significantly improves forecasting performance under distribution shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc790\uc8fc \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubd84\ud3ec \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc815\uaddc\ud654-\uc608\uce21 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc778 APT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "APT\ub294 \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud0ec\ud504 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825 \ubc0f \ucd9c\ub825 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "APT\ub294 \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc31\ubcf8-\uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "APT\ub294 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ubc31\ubcf8 \ubc0f \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \ud638\ud658\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654(\uc608: \ud3c9\uade0 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc0b0)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4.

Unlike narrative ladders, our scale is multi-axis and testable. We define ten capability axes (Autonomy, Generality, Planning, Memory/Persistence, Tool Economy, Self-Revision, Sociality/Coordination, Embodiment, World-Model Fidelity, Economic Throughput) aggregated by a composite AAI-Index (a weighted geometric mean). We introduce a measurable Self-Improvement Coefficient $\u03ba$ (capability growth per unit of agent-initiated resources) and two closure properties (maintenance and expansion) that convert ``self-improving AI'' into falsifiable criteria. We specify OWA-Bench, an open-world agency benchmark suite that evaluates long-horizon, tool-using, persistent agents.

We assume that a large amount $M$ of \\textit{unlabeled} data drawn from the sampling distribution $P$ is available, together with a small amount $N$ of labeled data drawn from the same distribution and noisy estimates of the corresponding ground truth entries. This setting is inspired by recommender systems scenarios where the unlabeled data corresponds to `implicit feedback' (consisting in interactions such as purchase, click, etc. ) and the labeled data corresponds to the `explicit feedback', consisting of interactions where the user has given an explicit rating to the item. Leveraging powerful results from the theory of low-rank subspace recovery, together with classic generalization bounds for matrix completion models, we show error bounds consisting of a sum of two error terms scaling as $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{nd}{M}}\\right)$ and $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{dr}{N}}\\right)$ respectively, where $d$ is the rank of $P$ and $r$ is the rank of $M$. In synthetic experiments, we confirm that the true generalization error naturally splits into independent error terms corresponding to the estimations of $P$ and and the ground truth matrix $\\ground$ respectively.

However, traditional analytics and visualization methods often yield fragmented outputs that demand extensive human interpretation, limiting scalability and consistency. This study presents a multi-agent framework that leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to automate data narration and energy insight generation. The framework coordinates three specialized agents, including a data narration agent, an LLM-as-a-judge agent, and an optional human-in-the-loop evaluator, to iteratively transform analytical artifacts into coherent, stakeholder-oriented reports. The system is validated through a real-world case study on public bus transportation in Northern Jutland, Denmark, where fuel efficiency data from 4006 trips are analyzed using Gaussian Mixture Model clustering. Comparative experiments across five state-of-the-art LLMs and three prompting paradigms identify GPT-4.1 mini with Chain-of-Thought prompting as the optimal configuration, achieving 97.3% narrative accuracy while balancing interpretability and computational cost. The findings demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration significantly enhances factual precision, coherence, and scalability in LLM-based reporting. The proposed framework establishes a replicable and domain-adaptive methodology for AI-driven narrative generation and decision support in energy informatics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5ec\uac1d

However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to \"undesirable\" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks.

We introduce FreeAskWorld, an interactive simulation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for high-level behavior planning and semantically grounded interaction, informed by theories of intention and social cognition. Our framework supports scalable, realistic human-agent simulations and includes a modular data generation pipeline tailored for diverse embodied tasks.To validate the framework, we extend the classic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task into a interaction enriched Direction Inquiry setting, wherein agents can actively seek and interpret navigational guidance. We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction. Importantly, our work underscores that interaction itself serves as an additional information modality.", "AI": {"tldr": "FreeAskWorld\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801

While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability. Its integration with clinical procedures could significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc720\ubc29\uc554\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc740

Existing masking-based methods attempt to mitigate such conflicts by assigning task-specific parameter masks. However, our empirical study shows that coarse-grained binary masks have the problem of over-suppressing key conflicting parameters, hindering knowledge sharing across tasks. Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency.\n  To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uacfc\uc81c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MTRL)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b0\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub098, \uacfc\uc81c \uac04\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucda9\ub3cc\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacfc\uc81c\ubcc4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub824\uace0 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc870\uc545\ud55c \uc774\uc9c4 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucda9\ub3cc \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc548\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SoCo-DT\ub77c\ub294 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ucda9\ub3cc \ud574\uacb0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, Fisher \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc911\uc694 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ucda9\ub3cc\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 SoCo-DT\uac00 MT50\uc5d0\uc11c 7.6%, \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c 10.5% \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uacfc\uc81c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4, \uacfc\uc81c \uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucda9\ub3cc \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "Fisher \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uac12\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, IQR \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \uc870\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacfc\uc81c\ubcc4 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 SoCo-DT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, SoCo-DT\uac00 Meta-World \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 MT50\uc5d0\uc11c 7.6%, \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c 10.5%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SoCo-DT\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uccb4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uacfc\uc81c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uacfc\uc81c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MTRL)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uacfc\uc81c \uac04\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucda9\ub3cc\ub85c \uace0\ud1b5\ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacfc\uc81c\ubcc4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc870\uc545\ud55c \uc774\uc9c4 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\uac00 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucda9\ub3cc \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uacfc\uc81c \uac04\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ubc29\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucda9\ub3cc \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uace0\uc815 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud568\uc774 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub09c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Project page: https://aku02.github.io/projects/difffp/", "summary": "Self-play reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant success in learning complex strategic and interactive behaviors in competitive multi-agent games. However, achieving such behaviors in continuous decision spaces remains challenging. Ensuring adaptability and generalization in self-play settings is critical for achieving competitive performance in dynamic multi-agent environments. These challenges often cause methods to converge slowly or fail to converge at all to a Nash equilibrium, making agents vulnerable to strategic exploitation by unseen opponents. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $\u03b5$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games. We validate our method on complex multi-agent environments, including racing and multi-particle zero-sum games. Simulation results show that the learned policies are robust against diverse opponents and outperform baseline reinforcement learning policies. Our approach achieves up to 3$\\times$ faster convergence and 30$\\times$ higher success rates on average against RL-based baselines, demonstrating its robustness to opponent strategies and stability

Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\uce58 \uc815\ubcf4(PEs)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud06c\uae30, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub2e8\uc11c\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac, \ubc94\uc8fc\ud615 \ubc0f \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Tab-PET \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec PEs\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 \uc5f0\uad00 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc778\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc720\ub3c4 PEs\uac00 3T(Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc5d0\uc11c 50\uac1c\uc758 \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \ud68c\uadc0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PEs\ub294 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uc740 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud06c\uae30, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub2e8\uc11c\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac, \ubc94\uc8fc\ud615 \ubc0f \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc804 \ubc0f \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uadc0\ub0a9\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc704\uce58 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc800\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 TabTransformer, SAINT, FT-Transformer(\uc774\ub4e4\uc744 3T\ub77c\uace0 \uc9c0\uce6d\ud568)\ub294 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud76c\ub9dd\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \uc704\uce58 \uc778\ucf54\ub529(PEs)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub2e8\uc11c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub098 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c PE\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub2e8\uc11c\uac00 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Their internal distributions remain largely unobservable and are typically inferred from surface-exposed discontinuities using generative prediction approaches. However, surface-exposed observations are inherently sparse, and existing generative prediction approaches either fail to capture the underlying complex distribution patterns or lack robustness under data-sparse conditions. Here, we proposed a simple yet robust approach for statistically accurate generative prediction of rock discontinuities by utilizing a tabular foundation model. By leveraging the powerful sample learning capability of the foundation model specifically designed for small data, our approach can effectively capture the underlying complex distribution patterns within limited measured discontinuities. Comparative experiments on ten datasets with diverse scales and distribution patterns of discontinuities demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness over conventional statistical models and deep generative approaches.

We introduce a novel hierarchical method that combines selective Optimal Transport (OT) alignment for attention layers with cosine similarity-weighted interpolation, designed to address permutation variance while minimizing computational overhead for edge deployment scenarios. Our study evaluates Task Arithmetic, Linear Averaging, DARE-TIES, DELLA, Breadcrumbs, and our Hierarchical approach across five medical benchmarks. Results demonstrate that architecturally compatible models benefit significantly from simple averaging methods, with Task Arithmetic achieving 45.80% accuracy on MedQA, outperforming complex pruning-based approaches.

Physics is the sharpest test of this shift, which binds symbols to reality in a fundamental way, serving as the cornerstone of most modern technologies. In this work, we manage to advance physics research by developing large language models with exceptional physics reasoning capabilities, especially excel at solving Olympiad-level physics problems. We introduce P1, a family of open-source physics reasoning models trained entirely through reinforcement learning (RL). Among them, P1-235B-A22B is the first open-source model with Gold-medal performance at the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO 2025), and wins 12 gold medals out of 13 international/regional physics competitions in 2024/2025. P1-30B-A3B also surpasses almost all other open-source models on IPhO 2025, getting a silver medal. Further equipped with an agentic framework PhysicsMinions, P1-235B-A22B+PhysicsMinions achieves overall No.1 on IPhO 2025, and obtains the highest average score over the 13 physics competitions. Besides physics, P1 models also present great performance on other reasoning tasks like math and coding, showing the great generalibility of P1 series.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc62c\ub9bc\ud53c\uc544\ub4dc \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 P1 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub9ac\ub85c\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ub3d9\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "method": "P1\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ucd94\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "P1-235B-A22B\ub294 2025 \uad6d\uc81c \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uc62c\ub9bc\ud53c\uc544\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uae08\uba54\ub2ec \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uace0, 2024/2025\ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 13\uac1c\uc758 \uad6d\uc81c/\uc9c0\uc5ed \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ub300\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c 12\uac1c\uc758 \uae08\uba54\ub2ec\uc744 \ud68d\ub4dd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "P1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub529\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd94\ub9ac \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ud37c\uc990 \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5d0 \ubc18\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub9ac\ub85c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ub3d9\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub0a0\uce74\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\ud638\ub97c \ud604\uc2e4\uc5d0 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\ub300 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \uc9c0\ud0f1\ud558\ub294 \ucd08\uc11d \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud0c1\uc6d4\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub9ac \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc62c\ub9bc\ud53c\uc544\ub4dc \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub0a9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc871\uc778 P1\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc911 P1-235B-A22B\ub294 2025 \uad6d\uc81c \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uc62c\ub9bc\ud53c\uc544\ub4dc(IPhO)\uc5d0\uc11c \uae08\uba54\ub2ec \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b8 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c 2024/2025\ub144 \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 13\uac1c\uc758 \uad6d\uc81c/\uc9c0\uc5ed \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ub300\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c 12\uac1c\uc758 \uae08\uba54\ub2ec\uc744 \uc6b0\uc2b9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Hu and Wu (FOCS'24) use this to define an approximate calibration measure called calibration decision loss ($\\mathsf{CDL}$), which measures the maximal improvement achievable by any post-processing over any proper loss. Unfortunately, $\\mathsf{CDL}$ turns out to be intractable to even weakly approximate in the offline setting, given black-box access to the predictions and labels.\n  We suggest circumventing this by restricting attention to structured families of post-processing functions $K$. We define the calibration decision loss relative to $K$, denoted $\\mathsf{CDL}_K$ where we consider all proper losses but restrict post-processings to a structured family $K$. We develop a comprehensive theory of when $\\mathsf{CDL}_K$ is information-theoretically and computationally tractable, and use it to prove both upper and lower bounds for natural classes $K$. In addition to introducing new definitions and algorithmic techniques to the theory of calibration for decision making, our results give rigorous guarantees for some widely used recalibration procedures in machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ubcf4\uc815\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud568\uc218 \uac00\uc871\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc815 \uacb0\uc815 \uc190\uc2e4(CDL)\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud30c\uc545\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ubcf4\uc815 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294 \uc131\uc9c8\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc1c\ub2ec\ub41c \ubcf4\uc815 \uacb0\uc815 \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac00\uc871 K\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubcf4\uc815 \uacb0\uc815 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc790\uc5f0\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 K\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c1\ud55c\uc120\uacfc \ud558\ud55c\uc120\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub860\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc5ec \uc678\uc5d0\ub3c4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc7ac\uc870\uc815 \uc808\ucc28\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc644\ubcbd\ud558\uac8c \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \uc608\uce21\uc790\ub97c \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc740 \uae30\ub300 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.
