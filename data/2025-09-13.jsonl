To address the growing need for effective\ncrop disease management, AI-based disease alerting systems have emerged as\npromising tools by providing early detection and actionable insights for timely\nintervention. However, existing systems often overlook critical aspects such as\ndata privacy, market pricing power, and farmer-friendly usability, leaving\nfarmers vulnerable to privacy breaches and economic exploitation.

In this paper, we propose a\nblockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,\ncomprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory\napplication layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an\nagent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,\n(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in\ncollaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for\nearly detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a\nsystematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory\nmechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future\nresearch directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent\nsystems."}

While\nAutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based\napproaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited\ninterpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot\nhyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI,\nand efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with\nSHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained\nmodels without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation\nto control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight\nmedical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that\nMetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO\nmethods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment\noutperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8\ntasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times\non 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of\nbest-performing baselines."}

However, integrating cryptographic protocols with large\nlanguage models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, as the inherent\ncomplexity of these protocols, together with LLMs' massive parameter scale and\nsophisticated architectures, severely limits practical usability. In this work,\nwe propose ENSI, a novel non-interactive secure inference framework for LLMs,\nbased on the principle of co-designing the cryptographic protocols and LLM\narchitecture. ENSI employs an optimized encoding strategy that seamlessly\nintegrates CKKS scheme with a lightweight LLM variant, BitNet, significantly\nreducing the computational complexity of encrypted matrix multiplications. In\nresponse to the prohibitive computational demands of softmax under homomorphic\nencryption (HE), we pioneer the integration of the sigmoid attention mechanism\nwith HE as a seamless, retraining-free alternative. Furthermore, by embedding\nthe Bootstrapping operation within the RMSNorm process, we efficiently refresh\nciphertexts while markedly decreasing the frequency of costly bootstrapping\ninvocations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ENSI achieves\napproximately an 8x acceleration in matrix multiplications and a 2.6x speedup\nin softmax inference on CPU compared to state-of-the-art method, with the\nproportion of bootstrapping is reduced to just 1%."}

Given the considerable intellectual and economic value embedded in\nsuch prompts, prompt theft poses a critical security and privacy concern. In\nthis paper, we investigate prompt-stealing attacks targeting diffusion models.\nWe reveal that numerical optimization-based prompt recovery methods are\nfundamentally limited as they do not account for the initial random noise used\nduring image generation. We identify and exploit a noise-generation\nvulnerability (CWE-339), prevalent in major image-generation frameworks,\noriginating from PyTorch's restriction of seed values to a range of $2^{32}$\nwhen generating the initial random noise on CPUs. Through a large-scale\nempirical analysis conducted on images shared via the popular platform CivitAI,\nwe demonstrate that approximately 95% of these images' seed values can be\neffectively brute-forced in 140 minutes per seed using our seed-recovery tool,\nSeedSnitch. Leveraging the recovered seed, we propose PromptPirate, a genetic\nalgorithm-based optimization method explicitly designed for prompt stealing.\nPromptPirate surpasses state-of-the-art methods, i.e., PromptStealer, P2HP, and\nCLIP-Interrogator, achieving an 8-11% improvement in LPIPS similarity.\nFurthermore, we introduce straightforward and effective countermeasures that\nrender seed stealing, and thus optimization-based prompt stealing, ineffective.\nWe have disclosed our findings responsibly and initiated coordinated mitigation\nefforts with the developers to address this critical vulnerability."}
