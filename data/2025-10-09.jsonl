In this work, we show that\nadversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed\nhard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such\nthat when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or\nmalicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models\ntargeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of\nfine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces;\n2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into\nwebpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply\nchain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data\nto improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few\nas 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an\nagent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a\nspecific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat\nmodels.

However, its reliance on a fixed\ntemperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,\ncausing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.\nRecent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general\noverfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more\ntargeted approach of $\\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its\nbatch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to\nmixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative\n$\\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful\ntraining signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference\nOptimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and\ninstance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first\ntrains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these\nmargins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each\nindividual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective\ntarget margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,\nallowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved\noptimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We\nvalidate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where\nMADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across\ndatasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\\% on\nHigh Quality data and +10.5\\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.\nOur results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to\npreference alignment."}

However, these approaches are\nfundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail\nto provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most\ncritically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical\ndeployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:\ntop-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,\nwhereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are\nrelatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical\nguarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse\nattention mechanism with user-specified $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ guarantees on\napproximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a\ncompelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at\nscale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both\nindividually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our\nexperiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse\nattention (e.g., $\\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and\nDeepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap\nbetween full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model\nquality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in\nreasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality\n(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with\nup to 32K token generations).

As cyber threats grow in scale and\ncomplexity, the demand for pentesting has surged, surpassing the capacity of\nhuman professionals to meet it effectively. With advances in AI, particularly\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), there have been attempts to automate the\npentesting process. However, existing tools such as PentestGPT are still\nsemi-manual, requiring significant professional human interaction to conduct\npentests. To this end, we propose a novel LLM agent-based framework,\nAutoPentester, which automates the pentesting process. Given a target IP,\nAutoPentester automatically conducts pentesting steps using common security\ntools in an iterative process. It can dynamically generate attack strategies\nbased on the tool outputs from the previous iteration, mimicking the human\npentester approach. We evaluate AutoPentester using Hack The Box and\ncustom-made VMs, comparing the results with the state-of-the-art PentestGPT.\nResults show that AutoPentester achieves a 27.0% better subtask completion rate\nand 39.5% more vulnerability coverage with fewer steps. Most importantly, it\nrequires significantly fewer human interactions and interventions compared to\nPentestGPT. Furthermore, we recruit a group of security industry professional\nvolunteers for a user survey and perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate\nAutoPentester against industry practices and compare it with PentestGPT. On\naverage, AutoPentester received a score of 3.93 out of 5 based on user reviews,\nwhich was 19.8% higher than PentestGPT."}

However, these approaches are\nfundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail\nto provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most\ncritically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical\ndeployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:\ntop-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,\nwhereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are\nrelatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical\nguarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse\nattention mechanism with user-specified $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ guarantees on\napproximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a\ncompelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at\nscale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both\nindividually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our\nexperiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse\nattention (e.g., $\\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and\nDeepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap\nbetween full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model\nquality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in\nreasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality\n(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with\nup to 32K token generations).

This\npaper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for\ninterpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a\ndeliberative \"debate\" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,\nenabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed\njustifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the\nCIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance\nagainst strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as\nPCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves\nsuperior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream\ntraining time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =\n0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative\narchitecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,\nestablishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world\napplications."}

Traditional approaches rely on expensive\nhuman-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic\ndata that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three\nexperiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory\nparadigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions\nfrom 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and\nMixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward\nstructures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating\nconsistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies\nprompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. \"be risk averse\"). LLM\noutputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse\nand risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic\ngrid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce\ntrajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully\nreplicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable\nfoundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates."}

As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows\nexponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.\nTherefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide\nexploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present\nReference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill\ndiscovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD\nfirst performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,\nclustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding\nenables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference\nbehaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a\nsimulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns\nstructured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and\nalso discovers related novel behaviors.

However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that\nStratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3\npoints, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more\neffective search policies. These results establish stratification as a\nprincipled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents."}
