However, these capabilities also expose\nmodels to prompt injection attacks, where maliciously crafted inputs overwrite\nor distract from the intended instructions. A core vulnerability lies in the\nmodel's lack of semantic role understanding: it cannot distinguish directive\nintent from descriptive content, leading it to execute instruction-like phrases\nembedded in data.\n  We propose DRIP, a training-time defense grounded in a semantic modeling\nperspective, which enforces robust separation between instruction and data\nsemantics without sacrificing utility. DRIP introduces two lightweight yet\ncomplementary mechanisms: (1) a token-wise de-instruction shift that performs\nsemantic disentanglement, weakening directive semantics in data tokens while\npreserving content meaning; and (2) a residual fusion pathway that provides a\npersistent semantic anchor, reinforcing the influence of the true top-level\ninstruction during generation. Experimental results on LLaMA-8B and Mistral-7B\nacross three prompt injection benchmarks (SEP, AlpacaFarm, and InjecAgent)\ndemonstrate that DRIP outperforms state-of-the-art defenses, including StruQ,\nSecAlign, ISE, and PFT, improving role separation by 49%, and reducing attack\nsuccess rate by 66% for adaptive attacks. Meanwhile, DRIP's utility is on par\nwith the undefended model across AlpacaEval, IFEval, and MT-Bench. Our findings\nunderscore the power of lightweight representation edits and role-aware\nsupervision in securing LLMs against adaptive prompt injection.", "AI": {"tldr": "DRIP\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c, \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc758\ubbf8 \uac04\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ub530\ub974\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \uc124\uba85\uc801 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "DRIP\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c, \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \uc2dc\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4: (1) \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud1a0\ud070 \ub2e8\uc704\uc758 \ube44\uc9c0\uc2dc \uc804\ud658\uacfc (2) \uc0dd\uc131 \uc911 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc704 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc575\ucee4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc794\uc5ec \uc735\ud569 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \uadf8\uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "LLaMA-8B \ubc0f Mistral-7B\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, DRIP\uc740 StruQ, SecAlign, ISE, PFT\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc5ed\ud560 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c 49% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 66% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DRIP\uc740 AlpacaEval, IFEval \ubc0f MT-Bench\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ubc29\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70, \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud45c\ud604 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc758 \ud798\uacfc \uc5ed\ud560 \uc778\uc2dd \uac10\ub3c5\uc774 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c LLM\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc218\ud589 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc791\ub41c \uc785\ub825\uc774 \uc758\ub3c4\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ub36e\uc5b4\uc4f0\uac70\ub098 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub418\uae30\ub3c4 \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc5ed\ud560 \uc774\ud574\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4: \uc774\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc124\uba85\uc801 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uacfc \uad6c\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ubb38\uad6c\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DRIP\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c, \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc758\ubbf8 \uac04\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \uc2dc\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.

To appear in the Proceedings of the\n  2025 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping numerous facets of our daily\nlives, leading widespread adoption as web-based services. Despite their\nversatility, LLMs face notable challenges, such as generating hallucinated\ncontent and lacking access to up-to-date information. Lately, to address such\nlimitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising\ndirection by generating responses grounded in external knowledge sources. A\ntypical RAG system consists of i) a retriever that probes a group of relevant\npassages from a knowledge base and ii) a generator that formulates a response\nbased on the retrieved content. However, as with other AI systems, recent\nstudies demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG, such as knowledge corruption\nattacks by injecting misleading information. In response, several defense\nstrategies have been proposed, including having LLMs inspect the retrieved\npassages individually or fine-tuning robust retrievers. While effective, such\napproaches often come with substantial computational costs.\n  In this work, we introduce RAGDefender, a resource-efficient defense\nmechanism against knowledge corruption (i.e., by data poisoning) attacks in\npractical RAG deployments. RAGDefender operates during the post-retrieval\nphase, leveraging lightweight machine learning techniques to detect and filter\nout adversarial content without requiring additional model training or\ninference. Our empirical evaluations show that RAGDefender consistently\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses across multiple models and\nadversarial scenarios: e.g., RAGDefender reduces the attack success rate (ASR)\nagainst the Gemini model from 0.89 to as low as 0.02, compared to 0.69 for\nRobustRAG and 0.24 for Discern-and-Answer when adversarial passages outnumber\nlegitimate ones by a factor of four (4x).", "AI": {"tldr": "RAGDefender\ub294 RAG \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc624\uc5fc \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c, \uacbd\ub7c9 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774\ub098 \ucd94\ub860 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc6f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub85c \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud658\uac01 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "RAGDefender\ub294 RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud6c4 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \uacbd\ub7c9 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RAGDefender\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uad6c\ubb38\uc774 \uc815\ub2f9\ud55c \uad6c\ubb38\ubcf4\ub2e4 4\ubc30 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacbd\uc6b0 Gemini \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 0.89\uc5d0\uc11c 0.02\ub85c \ub0ae\ucd98\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RAGDefender\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc624\uc5fc \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uace0\uae09 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc77c\uc0c1 \uc0dd\ud65c\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uce21\uba74\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc6f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub85c \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, LLMs\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud658\uac01 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\uc774 \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd9c\ucc98\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 i) \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ub828 \uad6c\ubb38 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9\uae30\uc640 ii) \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub2e4\ub978 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \ub9c8\ucc2c\uac00\uc9c0\ub85c, \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud574 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \ub4f1 RAG\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, LLMs\uac00 \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \uad6c\ubb38\uc744 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0ac\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9\uae30\ub97c \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc218\ubc18\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c RAG \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc624\uc5fc(\uc989, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc624\uc5fc) \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 RAGDefender\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

During the connection\nestablishment procedure, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer can be\nvulnerable to signaling storms, which threaten the availability of the radio\naccess control plane. These attacks may occur when one or more UEs send a large\nnumber of connection requests to the gNB, preventing new UEs from establishing\nconnections. In this paper, we investigate the detection of such threats and\npropose an adaptive threshold-based detection system based on Extreme Value\nTheory (EVT). The proposed solution is evaluated numerically by applying\nsimulated attack scenarios based on a realistic threat model on top of\nreal-world RRC traffic data from an operator network. We show that, by\nleveraging features from the RRC layer only, the detection system can not only\nidentify the attacks but also differentiate them from legitimate high-traffic\nsituations. The adaptive threshold calculated using EVT ensures that the system\ncan work under diverse traffic conditions. The results show high accuracy,\nprecision, and recall values (above 93%), and a low detection latency even\nunder complex conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 5G \ubc0f \uadf8 \uc774\ud6c4\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc7a5\ube44(UE)\uc640 \uae30\uc9c0\uad6d(gNodeB \ub610\ub294 gNB) \uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \uc2e0\ud638 \ud3ed\ud48d\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 EVT \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "5G \ubc0f \uadf8 \uc774\ud6c4\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c RRC \uacc4\uce35\uc758 \uc2e0\ud638 \ud3ed\ud48d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac00\uc6a9\uc131 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "Extreme Value Theory (EVT)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c RRC \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac10\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ud569\ubc95\uc801\uc778 \uace0 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uc0c1\ud669\uacfc \uad6c\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4(93% \uc774\uc0c1)\uc640 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4, \uc7ac\ud604\uc728\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc798 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub0ae\uc740 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "5G \ubc0f \uc774\ud6c4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc7a5\ube44(UE)\uc640 \uae30\uc9c0\uad6d(gNodeB \ub610\ub294 gNB) \uac04\uc758 \ub77c\ub514\uc624 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc811\uadfc \ubc0f \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uacb0 \uc124\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb34\uc120 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc5b4(RRC) \uacc4\uce35\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638 \ud3ed\ud48d\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubb34\uc120 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud3c9\uba74\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud611\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud558\ub098 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 UE\uac00 gNB\uc5d0 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc218\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ubcf4\ub0bc \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 UE\uac00 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc758 \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uadf9\ub2e8\uac12 \uc774\ub860(EVT)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6b4\uc601\uc790 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 RRC \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uce58\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We propose Magic Image,\nan optimization-driven visual prompt framework that enhances security while\nreducing over-refusal. By optimizing image prompts using harmful/benign\nsamples, our method enables a single model to adapt to different value systems\nand better align with given safety preferences without parameter updates.\nExperiments demonstrate improved safety-effectiveness balance across diverse\ndatasets while preserving model performance, offering a practical solution for\ndeployable MLLM safety

Traditional human-based quality\nassurance is labor-intensive and cannot scale with the industry's rapid growth.\nWhile automated testing has been applied to traditional 2D and 3D games,\nextending it to VR introduces unique difficulties due to high-dimensional\nsensory inputs and strict real-time performance requirements. We present\nVRScout, a deep learning-based agent capable of autonomously navigating VR\nenvironments and interacting with virtual objects in a human-like and real-time\nmanner. VRScout learns from human demonstrations using an enhanced Action\nChunking Transformer that predicts multi-step action sequences. This enables\nour agent to capture higher-level strategies and generalize across diverse\nenvironments.

Large Language Models\n(LLMs) can integrate multimodal inputs to address heterogeneous data in complex\nurban systems but often underperform on domain-specific tasks. Urban-MAS, an\nLLM-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework, is introduced for human-centered\nurban prediction under zero-shot settings. It includes three agent types:\nPredictive Factor Guidance Agents, which prioritize key predictive factors to\nguide knowledge extraction and enhance the effectiveness of compressed urban\nknowledge in LLMs; Reliable UrbanInfo Extraction Agents, which improve\nrobustness by comparing multiple outputs, validating consistency, and\nre-extracting when conflicts occur; and Multi-UrbanInfo Inference Agents, which\nintegrate extracted multi-source information across dimensions for prediction.\nExperiments on running-amount prediction and urban perception across Tokyo,\nMilan, and Seattle demonstrate that Urban-MAS substantially reduces errors\ncompared to single-LLM baselines. Ablation studies indicate that Predictive\nFactor Guidance Agents are most critical for enhancing predictive performance,\npositioning Urban-MAS as a scalable paradigm for human-centered urban AI\nprediction.

Despite these\nadvancements, recent methods still rely heavily on substantial paired (labeled)\nfeedback data, leading to substantial resource expenditures. To address these\nchallenges, we study the problem of Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization\n(SSPO) in which the idea is to learn from both a small number of pairwise\npreference labels and a large pool of unpaired samples simultaneously. Our key\ntheoretical contribution proves the existence of an optimal reward threshold\ncapable of separating winning and losing responses with high probability, which\nenables a principled pseudo-labeling of unpaired data. By leveraging these\npseudo-labels, SSPO effectively distills latent preferences from large-scale\nunpaired data, thus maintaining human alignment while drastically reducing\nacquisition costs.

However,\nsuch workflows are inherently error-prone: incorrect or partially correct\noutput at one step can propagate or even amplify through subsequent stages,\ncompounding the impact on the final output. Recent work proposes integrating\nverifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate,\nor LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant\nlatency and cost overheads.\n  In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a\nworkflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to\nselect the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification\nwith minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using\ncounterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and\nselectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime,\nSherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead,\nwhile verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is\nrolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying\nbaseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across\nbenchmarks. Sherlock reduces workflow execution time by up to 48.7% over\nnon-speculative execution and lowers verification cost by 26.0% compared to the\nMonte Carlo search-based method, demonstrating that principled, fault-aware\nverification effectively balances efficiency and reliability in agentic\nworkflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774

Feature-Guided Analysis (FGA) extracts\nslices of neural networks relevant to their tasks. Existing feature-guided\napproaches typically monitor the activation of the neural network neurons to\nextract the relevant rules. Preliminary results are encouraging and demonstrate\nthe feasibility of this solution by assessing the precision and recall of\nFeature-Guided Analysis on two pilot case studies. However, the applicability\nin industrial contexts needs additional empirical evidence.\n  To mitigate this need, this paper assesses the applicability of FGA on a\nbenchmark made by the MNIST and LSC datasets. We assessed the effectiveness of\nFGA in computing rules that explain the behavior of the neural network. Our\nresults show that FGA has a higher precision on our benchmark than the results\nfrom the literature. We also evaluated how the selection of the neural network\narchitecture, training, and feature selection affect the effectiveness of FGA.\nOur results show that the selection significantly affects the recall of FGA,\nwhile it has a negligible impact on its precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Feature-Guided Analysis(FGA)\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc801 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 MNIST\uc640 LSC \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 FGA\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 MNIST \ubc0f LSC \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c FGA\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 FGA\uac00 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uace0\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ud2b9\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 FGA\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc5d0 significant\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uace0, \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc5d0\ub294 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \ud2b9\uc815 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\ucd94\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.

However, many current MAS frameworks struggle with reliability and\nscalability, especially on complex tasks.

Built as an\ninfrastructure layer on top of LangGraph, AgentGit supports state commit,\nrevert, and branching, allowing agents to traverse, compare, and explore\nmultiple trajectories efficiently. To evaluate AgentGit, we designed an\nexperiment that optimizes target agents by selecting better prompts. We ran a\nmulti-step A/B test against three baselines -- LangGraph, AutoGen, and Agno --\non a real-world task: retrieving and analyzing paper abstracts. Results show\nthat AgentGit significantly reduces redundant computation, lowers runtime and\ntoken usage, and supports parallel exploration across multiple branches,\nenhancing both reliability and scalability in MAS development.

FL allows\nbypassing limitations of the traditional Centralized Machine Learning CL if\ndata cannot be shared or stored centrally due to privacy or technical\nrestrictions -- the participants train the model locally with their training\ndata and do not need to share it among the other participants. This paper\ninvestigates the practical implementation and effectiveness of FL in a\nreal-world scenario, specifically focusing on unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-based thermal images for common thermal feature detection in urban\nenvironments. The distributed nature of the data arises naturally and makes it\nsuitable for FL applications, as images captured in two German cities are\navailable. This application presents unique challenges due to non-identical\ndistribution and feature characteristics of data captured at both locations.\nThe study makes several key contributions by evaluating FL algorithms in real\ndeployment scenarios rather than simulation. We compare several FL approaches\nwith a centralized learning baseline across key performance metrics such as\nmodel accuracy, training time, communication overhead, and energy usage. This\npaper also explores various FL workflows, comparing client-controlled workflows\nand server-controlled workflows. The findings of this work serve as a valuable\nreference for understanding the practical application and limitations of the FL\nmethods in segmentation tasks in UAV-based imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 UAV \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5f4\uc0c1 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uad6c\ud604\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "FL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\ud3ec \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec FL \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc900\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc131\ub2a5 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "UAV \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc758 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c FL \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \ucc38\uace0\uc790\ub8cc\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uc720 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(ML) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We propose\nBelief-based Predictive Auxiliary Learning (BEPAL), a framework that\nincorporates auxiliary training objectives to support policy optimization.\nBEPAL follows the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm.\nEach agent learns a belief model that predicts unobservable state information,\nsuch as other agents' rewards or motion directions, alongside its policy model.\nBy enriching hidden state representations with information that does not\ndirectly contribute to immediate reward maximization, this auxiliary learning\nprocess stabilizes MARL training and improves overall performance.

The brain builds meaning through layers, moving from raw\nacoustics to rich, multimodal associations. Inspired by this, we build on\nrecent work from Meta that aligned EEG signals with averaged wav2vec2 speech\nembeddings, and ask a deeper question: which layers of pre-trained models best\nreflect this layered processing in the brain? We compare embeddings from two\nmodels: wav2vec2, which encodes sound into language, and CLIP, which maps words\nto images. Using EEG recorded during natural speech perception, we evaluate how\nthese embeddings align with brain activity using ridge regression and\ncontrastive decoding. We test three strategies: individual layers, progressive\nconcatenation, and progressive summation.

Model-free Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)\nalgorithms struggle with the joint challenge of representation learning,\npartial observability, and credit assignment. To address this, we propose a\nnovel framework based on a shared, generative Multimodal World Model (MWM). Our\nMWM is trained to learn a compressed latent representation of the environment's\ndynamics by fusing distributed, multimodal observations from all agents using a\nscalable attention-based mechanism. Subsequently, we leverage this learned MWM\nas a fast, \"imagined\" simulator to train cooperative MARL policies (e.g.,\nMAPPO) entirely within its latent space, decoupling representation learning\nfrom policy learning. We introduce a new set of challenging multimodal,\nmulti-agent benchmarks built on a 3D physics simulator. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that our MWM-MARL framework achieves orders-of-magnitude greater\nsample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-free MARL baselines. We\nfurther show that our proposed multimodal fusion is essential for task success\nin environments with sensory asymmetry and that our architecture provides\nsuperior robustness to sensor-dropout, a

Among existing algorithms, Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) has demonstrated strong performance, yet it suffers from a\ncritical issue: low-probability tokens disproportionately dominate gradient\nupdates due to their inherently large gradient magnitudes. This imbalance leads\nto unstable training and suppresses the contribution of high-probability tokens\nthat are more reliable for learning. In this work, we introduce Token-Regulated\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (TR-GRPO), a simple yet effective extension\nof GRPO that assigns token-level weights positively correlated with the model's\npredicted probability. By downweighting low-probability tokens and emphasizing\nhigh-probability ones, TR-GRPO mitigates gradient over-amplification while\npreserving informative learning signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nTR-GRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across RLVR tasks, including logic, math,\nand agentic reasoning, highlighting the importance of regulating token\ncontributions during RL training and establishing TR-GRPO as a robust framework\nfor enhancing LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "TR-GRPO\ub294 \ud1a0\ud070 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc800\ud655\ub960 \ud1a0\ud070\uc774 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ud655\ub960\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uad00\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\ud655\ub960 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd94\uace0 \uace0\ud655\ub960 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 TR-GRPO\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "TR-GRPO\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec RLVR \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c GRPO\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud1a0\ud070 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 RL \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, TR-GRPO\ub294 LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744\u589e\u5f3a\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uc558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1(reward)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLVR)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud070 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ud06c\uae30\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc800\ud655\ub960 \ud1a0\ud070\uc774 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\ud655\ub960 \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ud655\ub960\uacfc \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uad00\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 GRPO\uc758 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud655\uc7a5\uc778 Token-Regulated Group Relative Policy Optimization (TR-GRPO)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, prior studies often assume fixed\ncollaboration architectures (e.g., topologies) and single-model usage,\noverlooking that optimal architectures and model combinations can vary across\ntasks. Therefore, we study the novel problem of searching for compute-optimal\nmodel combinations and architectures in TTS under a fixed budget. We formalize\nit as a multi-LLM collaboration graph, where nodes encode roles and LLM model\nassignments, and edges capture information flow. This problem is challenging\nbecause (i) the combinatorial search space is prohibitively large, and (ii)\ntask-specific requirements demand tailored designs. To address these, we\nreformulate the problem as probabilistic graph optimization and, through pilot\nexperiments, derive three empirical insights into TTS collaboration graphs.\nGuided by these insights, we propose Agent-REINFORCE, an LLM-agent-augmented\nframework that mirrors the REINFORCE pipeline by mapping\nsampling-gradient-update to sampling-feedback-update, where feedback serves as\na textual gradient to update the probabilistic graph and efficiently search for\noptimal multi-LLM collaboration graphs.

A common approach,\npopularized by ChebyNet, is to use polynomial filters based on continuous\northogonal polynomials (e.g., Chebyshev). This creates a theoretical\ndisconnect, as these continuous-domain filters are applied to inherently\ndiscrete graph structures. We hypothesize this mismatch can lead to suboptimal\nperformance and fragility to hyperparameter settings.\n  In this paper, we introduce MeixnerNet, a novel spectral GNN architecture\nthat employs discrete orthogonal polynomials -- specifically, the Meixner\npolynomials $M_k(x; \\beta, c)$. Our model makes the two key shape parameters of\nthe polynomial, beta and c, learnable, allowing the filter to adapt its\npolynomial basis to the specific spectral properties of a given graph. We\novercome the significant numerical instability of these polynomials by\nintroducing a novel stabilization technique that combines Laplacian scaling\nwith per-basis LayerNorm.\n  We demonstrate experimentally that MeixnerNet achieves\ncompetitive-to-superior performance against the strong ChebyNet baseline at the\noptimal K = 2 setting (winning on 2 out of 3 benchmarks).

However, the proliferation of fake or misleading reviews often\ngenerated by bots, paid agents, or AI models poses a significant threat to\ntrust and transparency within review ecosystems. Existing detection models\nprimarily rely on unimodal, typically textual, data and therefore fail to\ncapture semantic inconsistencies across different modalities. To address this\ngap, a robust multimodal fake review detection framework is proposed,\nintegrating textual features encoded with BERT and visual features extracted\nusing ResNet-50. These representations are fused through a classification head\nto jointly predict review authenticity. To support this approach, a curated\ndataset comprising 21,142 user-uploaded images across food delivery,\nhospitality, and e-commerce domains was utilized.

However, machine learning-based\ncontrollers are essential to unlock greater energy efficiency and reliability,\npromoting sustainability. We present LC-Opt, a Sustainable Liquid Cooling (LC)\nbenchmark environment, for reinforcement learning (RL) control strategies in\nenergy-efficient liquid cooling of high-performance computing (HPC) systems.\nBuilt on the baseline of a high-fidelity digital twin of Oak Ridge National\nLab's Frontier Supercomputer cooling system, LC-Opt provides detailed\nModelica-based end-to-end models spanning site-level cooling towers to data\ncenter cabinets and server blade groups. RL agents optimize critical thermal\ncontrols like liquid supply temperature, flow rate, and granular valve\nactuation at the IT cabinet level, as well as cooling tower (CT) setpoints\nthrough a Gymnasium interface, with dynamic changes in workloads. This\nenvironment creates a multi-objective real-time optimization challenge\nbalancing local thermal regulation and global energy efficiency, and also\nsupports additional components like a heat recovery unit (HRU). We benchmark\ncentralized and decentralized multi-agent RL approaches, demonstrate policy\ndistillation into decision and regression trees for interpretable control, and\nexplore LLM-based methods that explain control actions in natural language\nthrough an agentic mesh architecture designed to foster user trust and simplify\nsystem management. LC-Opt democratizes access to detailed, customizable liquid\ncooling models, enabling the ML community, operators, and vendors to develop\nsustainable data center liquid cooling control solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uace0\ubc00\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc13c\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc561\uccb4 \ub0c9\uac01\uc740 \uc5f4 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\uac00 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc791\uc5c5\ub7c9 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uace0\ubc00\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc13c\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f4 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc561\uccb4 \ub0c9\uac01\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "LC-Opt\ub294 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc561\uccb4 \ub0c9\uac01\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud658\uacbd\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 IT \uce90\ube44\ub2db \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc561\uccb4 \uacf5\uae09 \uc628\ub3c4, \uc720\ub7c9, \ubc38\ube0c \uc791\ub3d9 \ub4f1\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba70, Gymnasium \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5\ub7c9\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub0c9\uac01 \ud0c0\uc6cc\uc758 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LC-Opt\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc13c\ud130 \uc561\uccb4 \ub0c9\uac01 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc561\uccb4 \ub0c9\uac01\uc740 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 AI \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uace0\ubc00\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc13c\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f4 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\uac00 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305(HPC) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc561\uccb4 \ub0c9\uac01\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc561\uccb4 \ub0c9\uac01(LC) \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud658\uacbd\uc778 LC-Opt\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yet\nprogress is limited by the absence of benchmarks that realistically capture the\ninterplay of time-varying environmental factors (grid carbon intensity,\nelectricity prices, weather), detailed data center physics (CPUs, GPUs, memory,\nHVAC energy), and geo-distributed network dynamics (latency and transmission\ncosts). To bridge this gap, we present DCcluster-Opt: an open-source,\nhigh-fidelity simulation benchmark for sustainable, geo-temporal task\nscheduling. DCcluster-Opt combines curated real-world datasets, including AI\nworkload traces, grid carbon intensity, electricity markets, weather across 20\nglobal regions, cloud transmission costs, and empirical network delay\nparameters with physics-informed models of data center operations, enabling\nrigorous and reproducible research in sustainable computing. It presents a\nchallenging scheduling problem where a top-level coordinating agent must\ndynamically reassign or defer tasks that arrive with resource and service-level\nagreement requirements across a configurable cluster of data centers to\noptimize multiple objectives. The environment also models advanced components\nsuch as heat recovery. A modular reward system enables an explicit study of\ntrade-offs among carbon emissions, energy costs, service level agreements, and\nwater use.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nMulti-Agent System (MAS) that employs an agentic workflow, with Large Language\nModels (LLMs) coordinating multiple specialized tools for fully automated\nnetwork troubleshooting. Once faults are detected by AI/ML-based monitors, the\nframework dynamically activates agents such as an orchestrator, solution\nplanner, executor, data retriever, and root-cause analyzer to diagnose issues\nand recommend remediation strategies within a short time frame.

However, existing LLM-based approaches are\nlimited by fixed time signal durations and are prone to hallucination errors,\nwhile RL methods lack robustness in signal timing decisions and suffer from\npoor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes\nHeraldLight, a dual LLMs architecture enhanced by Herald guided prompts. The\nHerald Module extracts contextual information and forecasts queue lengths for\neach traffic phase based on real-time conditions. The first LLM, LLM-Agent,\nuses these forecasts to make fine grained traffic signal control, while the\nsecond LLM, LLM-Critic, refines LLM-Agent's outputs, correcting errors and\nhallucinations. These refined outputs are used for score-based fine-tuning to\nimprove accuracy and robustness. Simulation experiments using CityFlow on real\nworld datasets covering 224 intersections in Jinan (12), Hangzhou (16), and New\nYork (196) demonstrate that HeraldLight outperforms state of the art baselines,\nachieving a 20.03% reduction in average travel time across all scenarios and a\n10.74% reduction in average queue length on the Jinan and Hangzhou scenarios.\nThe source code is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/BUPT-ANTlab/HeraldLight.", "AI": {"tldr": "HeraldLight\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc911 LLM \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c, \ud3c9\uade0 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 20.03% \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ub300\uae30\uc5f4 \uae38\uc774\ub97c 10.74% \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Herald guided prompts\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uae30\uc5f4 \uae38\uc774\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 Herald \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c \uc774\uc911 LLM \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HeraldLight\ub294 CityFlow \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 20.03%, \ub300\uae30\uc5f4 \uae38\uc774\ub97c 10.74% \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, GitHub\uc5d0\uc11c \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4(TSC)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc2e0\ud638 \uc9c0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ud5db\ub41c \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\uace0, RL \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638 \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Herald guided prompts\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc774\uc911 LLM \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 HeraldLight\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The framework employs a\nhierarchical multi-agent architecture where a Chief Engineer coordinates\nspecialized agents consisting of Aerodynamics, Structural, Acoustic, and\nOptimization Engineers, each powered by LLM with domain-specific knowledge.\nAgent-agent collaboration is achieved through file-mediated communication for\ndata provenance and reproducibility, while a comprehensive memory system\nmaintains project context, execution history, and retrieval-augmented domain\nknowledge to ensure reliable decision-making across the workflow. The system\nintegrates FreeCAD, Gmsh, OpenFOAM, CalculiX, and BPM acoustic analysis,\nenabling parallel multidisciplinary simulations while maintaining computational\naccuracy. The framework is validated through UAV wing optimization. This work\ndemonstrates that agentic-AI-enabled AI engineers has the potential to perform\ncomplex engineering tasks autonomously.

We first systematically characterize Agentic AI on the basis of\norchestrator/decision making component, inference path dynamics and\nrepetitiveness of the agentic flow which directly influences the system-level\nperformance. Thereafter, based on the characterization, we choose five\nrepresentative agentic AI workloads- Haystack RAG, Toolformer, ChemCrow,\nLangchain and SWE-Agent to profile latency, throughput and energy metrics and\ndemystify the significant impact of CPUs on these metrics relative to GPUs. We\nobserve that - 1. Tool processing on CPUs can take up to 90.6% of the total\nlatency; 2. Agentic throughput gets bottlenecked either by CPU factors -\ncoherence, synchronization and over-subscription of cores or GPU factors - main\nmemory capacity and bandwidth; \\circled{3} CPU dynamic energy consumes up to\n44% of the total dynamic energy at large batch sizes. Based on the profiling\ninsights, we present two key optimizations- 1. CPU and GPU-Aware Micro-batching\n(CGAM) and 2.

Our core insight is that pretrained, non-autoregressive\ngenerative LLMs, such as Diffusion LLMs, which model the joint distribution\nover prompt-response pairs, can serve as powerful surrogates for prompt search.\nThis approach enables the direct conditional generation of prompts, effectively\nreplacing costly, per-instance discrete optimization with a small number of\nparallelizable samples. We provide a probabilistic analysis demonstrating that\nunder mild fidelity assumptions, only a few conditional samples are required to\nrecover high-reward (harmful) prompts. Empirically, we find that the generated\nprompts are low-perplexity, diverse jailbreaks that exhibit strong\ntransferability to a wide range of black-box target models, including robustly\ntrained and proprietary LLMs. Beyond adversarial prompting, our framework opens\nnew directions for red teaming, automated prompt optimization, and leveraging\nemerging Flow- and Diffusion-based LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uade0\ub4f1\ud558\uac8c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc18c\ubaa8 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0ac\uc804\ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ube44\uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0 \uc0dd\uc131 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8-\uc751\ub2f5 \uc30d\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud63c\ub780\ub3c4\uc640 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc804\uc774 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \ubc0f \uc790\ub3d9 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 (\uc801\ub300\uc801) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud560\ub2f9\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ud1b5\ucc30\uc740 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8-\uc751\ub2f5 \uc30d\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ube44\uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0 \uc0dd\uc131 LLM, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 Diffusion LLMs\uac00 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub300\uccb4\ubb3c\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uc2fc \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ubcc4 \uc774\uc0b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uba70 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc628\uac74\ud55c \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0 \uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 (\uc720\ud574) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\uac00 \uc801\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ud655\ub960\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud63c\ub780\ub3c4\uc640 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc804\uc774\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ub300\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378, \ud2b9\ud788 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uac8c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uace0\uc720 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uc804\uc774\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub808\ub4dc \ud300, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Flow \ubc0f Diffusion \uae30\ubc18 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4 \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

For algorithms that require extensive intra-task exemplars, a\nsignificant constraint imposed by ARC-AGI is the modest cardinality of its\ndemonstration set, comprising a small number of $\\langle$ input, output\n$\\rangle$ grids per task specifying the corresponding transformation. To\nembellish the space of viable sample pairs, this paper introduces ARC-GEN, an\nopen-source procedural generator aimed at extending the original ARC-AGI\ntraining dataset as faithfully as possible. Unlike prior efforts, our generator\nis both exhaustive (covering all four-hundred tasks) and mimetic (more closely\nhonoring the distributional properties and characteristics embodied in the\ninitial ARC-AGI-1 release). We also discuss the use of this generator in\nestablishing a static benchmark suite to verify the correctness of programs\nsubmitted to the 2025 Google Code Golf Championship.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARC-AGI \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc6d0\ub798 ARC-AGI \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30 ARC-GEN\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ARC-AGI\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub85c, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc220 \uc2b5\ub4dd\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ARC-GEN\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 ARC-AGI \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud55c \ucda9\uc2e4\ud558\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub4e0 400\uac1c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubaa8\ubc29\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "ARC-GEN\uc740 ARC-AGI\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc18d\uc131\uacfc \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc5ec, \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc30d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 2025 Google Code Golf Championship\uc5d0 \uc81c\ucd9c\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd94\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8(ARC)\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5(AGI)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5 \uae30\uc220 \ub610\ub294 \ub204\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac, ARC-AGI \uc2a4\uc704\ud2b8\ub294 \uae30\uc220 \uc2b5\ub4dd \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc6d0\ub798 ARC-AGI \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud55c \ucda9\uc2e4\ud558\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc808\ucc28 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\uc778 ARC-GEN\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \ub178\ub825\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 400\uac1c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\uba70 \ucd08\uae30 ARC-AGI-1 \ub9b4\ub9ac\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc874\uc911\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 2025 Google Code Golf Championship\uc5d0 \uc81c\ucd9c\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Stabilizing these flows is highly\ndesirable but remains challenging, particularly in chaotic regimes where\nconventional control methods often fail. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown\npromise for control in laminar flow settings, but its ability to generalize and\nremain robust under chaotic and turbulent dynamics is not well explored,\ndespite being critical for real-world deployment. In this work, we improve the\npractical feasibility of RL-based control of such flows focusing on\nRayleigh-B\\'enard Convection (RBC), a canonical model for convective heat\ntransport. To enhance generalization and sample efficiency, we introduce\ndomain-informed RL agents that are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization\nacross diverse initial conditions and flow regimes. We incorporate domain\nknowledge in the reward function via a term that encourages B\\'enard cell\nmerging, as an example of a desirable macroscopic property. In laminar flow\nregimes, the domain-informed RL agents reduce convective heat transport by up\nto 33%, and in chaotic flow regimes, they still achieve a 10% reduction, which\nis significantly better than the conventional controllers used in practice. We\ncompare the domain-informed to uninformed agents: Our results show that the\ndomain-informed reward design results in steady flows, faster convergence\nduring training, and generalization across flow regimes without retraining. Our\nwork demonstrates that elegant domain-informed priors can greatly enhance the\nrobustness of RL-based control of chaotic flows, bringing real-world deployment\ncloser.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

To address this, we introduce\nCLAUSE, a first-of-its-kind benchmark designed to evaluate the fragility of an\nLLM's legal reasoning. We study the capabilities of LLMs to detect and reason\nabout fine-grained discrepancies by producing over 7500 real-world perturbed\ncontracts from foundational datasets like CUAD and ContractNLI. Our novel,\npersona-driven pipeline generates 10 distinct anomaly categories, which are\nthen validated against official statutes using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) system to ensure legal fidelity.

In this work, we pioneer the exploration of generative\nembeddings, unifying embedding tasks within a generative paradigm. We propose\nUME-R1, a universal multimodal embedding framework consisting of a two-stage\ntraining strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning equips the model with\nreasoning capabilities and enables it to generate both discriminative and\ngenerative embeddings; a subsequent reinforcement learning enhances reasoning\nand further optimizes generative embedding quality. This pioneering work\nreveals four key insights: 1) generative embeddings unlock substantial\nperformance gains over conventional discriminative embeddings by leveraging the\npowerful generative reasoning capabilities of MLLMs; 2) discriminative and\ngenerative embeddings are complementary, whose combined oracle performance far\nexceeding that of either alone; 3) RL can effectively enhance generative\nembeddings, establishing a scalable optimization paradigm.; 4) repeated\nsampling at inference boosts downstream task coverage (pass@k), highlighting\nthe inference-time scalability potential of generative embeddings. Evaluated on\nthe MMEB-V2 benchmark across 78 tasks spanning video, image, and visual\ndocuments, UME-R1 significantly outperforms conventional discriminative\nembedding models and offers a foundation for more interpretable,\nreasoning-driven generative multimodal embeddings.

Due to memory retrieval and\nconcurrent tool executions at certain decision points, the token trajectory of\none task evolves into a tree-like structure rather than a linear sequence.\nHowever, current training pipelines decompose such tree-structured trajectories\ninto separate linear segments, treating each branch as an independent sequence.\nAs a result, shared prefixes across these branches are repeatedly recomputed\nduring both forward and backward passes. To address this inefficiency, we\npropose Tree Training, a paradigm that computes each shared prefix only once\nand reuses its intermediate results across related branches during both forward\nand backward passes, substantially improving computation efficiency in\nlarge-scale agentic training. This is achieved via (i) Tree Packing, which\nefficiently reuses shared computations across trajectories, and (ii) Gradient\nRestoration, which ensures correct gradient propagation across reused prefixes.\nExperiments on multiple open-source models demonstrate up to 3.9x reduction in\ntotal training time, enabling more efficient agentic LLM SFT and RL training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tree Training\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc811\ub450\uc0ac \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0, \ud070 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd84\uae30 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Tree Training paradigm\uc740 \uac01 \uacf5\uc720 \uc811\ub450\uc0ac\ub97c \ud55c \ubc88\ub9cc \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubd84\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \uc911\uac04 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Tree Packing \ubc0f Gradient Restoration \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\ub300 3.9\ubc30\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 LLM\uc758 SFT \ubc0f RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub864\uc544\uc6c3 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd84\uae30 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\uc815 \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \ub3d9\uc2dc \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uacbd\ub85c\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ud2b8\ub9ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud2b8\ub9ac \uad6c\uc870 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ubcc4\uac1c\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ubd84\uae30\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd84\uae30 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uc720 \uc811\ub450\uc0ac\ub294 \uc21c\ubc29\ud5a5 \ubc0f \uc5ed\ubc29\ud5a5 \ud328\uc2a4 \ub3d9\uc548 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uacc4\uc0b0\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Tree Training\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uac01 \uacf5\uc720 \uc811\ub450\uc0ac\ub97c \ud55c \ubc88\ub9cc \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0 \uc21c\ubc29\ud5a5 \ubc0f \uc5ed\ubc29\ud5a5 \ud328\uc2a4 \ub3d9\uc548 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubd84\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uac04 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 (i) \uacbd\ub85c \uac04\uc5d0 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 Tree Packing\uacfc (ii) \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \uc811\ub450\uc0ac \uac04\uc758 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 Gradient Restoration\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ucd1d \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ucd5c\ub300 3.9\ubc30 \ub2e8\ucd95\ub418\uc5b4 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 LLM SFT \ubc0f RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this field, existing research predominantly adopts\nmulti-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks\npresents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC)\nproblem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on\ncentralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic\nconditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all\nintersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model\ncompatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design\ninclude state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning\nand manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on\nqueue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length\ndefinition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions\nbut is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows\nfor reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With\nprobe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the\nproposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was\ncomprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform.

Recent advances in self-supervised learning, particularly\nreconstruction-based objectives, have demonstrated strong potential for\npretraining models that generalize effectively across diverse downstream\nfunctional MRI (fMRI) tasks. In this study, we explore region-aware\nreconstruction strategies for a foundation model in resting-state fMRI, moving\nbeyond approaches that rely on random region masking. Specifically, we\nintroduce an ROI-guided masking strategy using the Automated Anatomical\nLabelling Atlas (AAL3), applied directly to full 4D fMRI volumes to selectively\nmask semantically coherent brain regions during self-supervised pretraining.\nUsing the ADHD-200 dataset comprising 973 subjects with resting-state fMRI\nscans, we show that our method achieves a 4.23% improvement in classification\naccuracy for distinguishing healthy controls from individuals diagnosed with\nADHD, compared to conventional random masking. Region-level attribution\nanalysis reveals that brain volumes within the limbic region and cerebellum\ncontribute most significantly to reconstruction fidelity and model\nrepresentation. Our results demonstrate that masking anatomical regions during\nmodel pretraining not only enhances interpretability but also yields more\nrobust and discriminative representations. In future work, we plan to extend\nthis approach by evaluating it on additional neuroimaging datasets, and\ndeveloping new loss functions explicitly derived from region-aware\nreconstruction objectives.

While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for\ncongestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture\nreal-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel\nsingle-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC,\ncircumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems\nthrough a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency\nmatrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states\nderived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters.\nLeveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model,\nthe agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select\nintersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic\ninflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design\nprioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue\nlength) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO\ndemonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with\nmulti-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the\nframework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces\nqueue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic\ncontrol compatible with probe vehicle technology.

This raises a critical question: can RL\npost-training truly extend the inherent capability boundary of a base VLM,\nparticularly for visual-centric spatial tasks where it initially fails? To\ninvestigate this, we introduce Ariadne, a framework utilizing synthetic mazes\nfor multi-step spatial reasoning where task difficulty (e.g., path length,\nturns) is precisely controlled. We leverage this controllable environment to\ntrain VLMs using Reinforcement Learning with Verified Rewards (RLVR) in a\ndifficulty-aware curriculum. Surprisingly, post-RLVR training, the VLM achieves\nover 50% accuracy on a problem set where the base model scored 0%,\ndemonstrating that our approach expands the model's initial capability\nboundary. To assess real-world viability, we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization on practical benchmarks. Despite training only on synthetic maze\nsamples, Ariadne achieves significant zero-shot improvements, averaging 16% on\nMapBench (e.g., museum navigation) and 24% on ReasonMap (subway transfer\ntasks).

Traditional structure learning methods often require\nextensive observational data and incur high computational costs. Recent studies\nhave explored using large language models (LLMs) for structure learning, but\nmost treat LLMs as auxiliary tools for pre-processing or post-processing,\nleaving the core learning process data-driven. In this work, we propose a\nunified framework for Bayesian network structure discovery that places LLMs at\nthe center, supporting both data-free and data-aware settings. In the data-free\ncase, we introduce \\textbf{PromptBN} to query LLMs with metadata and\nefficiently uncover valid probabilistic relationships. When observational data\nare available, we introduce \\textbf{ReActBN}, which integrates the ReAct\nreasoning paradigm with structure scores such as the Bayesian Information\nCriterion (BIC) for iterative refinement. Unlike prior methods that offload\nrefinement to external algorithms, our framework maintains the LLM actively in\nthe loop throughout the discovery process. Experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms both existing LLM-based approaches and\ntraditional data-driven algorithms, particularly in the low- or no-data\nscenario.

Earlier research with\nolder models showed that combining multiple reasoning chains improves results\nbefore reaching a plateau. Using Gemini 2.5 models on HotpotQA and Math-500, we\nrevisit those claims under current model conditions. Each configuration pooled\noutputs from varying sampled reasoning paths and compared them to a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT) baseline.

Privacy-aware synthetic time series\ngeneration addresses this challenge by enforcing noise during training,\ninherently introducing a trade-off between privacy and utility. In many cases,\nsensitive sequences is correlated with publicly available, non-sensitive\ncontextual metadata (e.g., household electricity consumption may be influenced\nby weather conditions and electricity prices). However, existing privacy-aware\ndata generation methods often overlook this opportunity, resulting in\nsuboptimal privacy-utility trade-offs. In this paper, we present Pub2Priv, a\nnovel framework for generating private time series data by leveraging\nheterogeneous public knowledge. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism to\nencode public data into temporal and feature embeddings, which serve as\nconditional inputs for a diffusion model to generate synthetic private\nsequences. Additionally, we introduce a practical metric to assess privacy by\nevaluating the identifiability of the synthetic data.

While count-based learners continue to perform strongly on such\ndata, no benchmarking has directly compared them against more recent\nmixture-of-agents LLM pipelines, which have been reported to outperform single\nLLMs in various NLP tasks. In this study, we evaluated three categories of\nmethodologies for EHR prediction using the EHRSHOT dataset: count-based models\nbuilt from ontology roll-ups with two time bins, based on LightGBM and the\ntabular foundation model TabPFN; a pretrained sequential transformer (CLMBR);\nand a mixture-of-agents pipeline that converts tabular histories to\nnatural-language summaries followed by a text classifier. We assessed eight\noutcomes using the EHRSHOT dataset. Across the eight evaluation tasks,\nhead-to-head wins were largely split between the count-based and the\nmixture-of-agents methods. Given their simplicity and interpretability,\ncount-based models remain a strong candidate for structured EHR benchmarking.\nThe source code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/cristea-lab/Structured_EHR_Benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "EHR \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uce74\uc6b4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud63c\ud569 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ube44\uc2b7\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHR)\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "EHRSHOT \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4: LightGBM\uacfc TabPFN\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uac04 \uad6c\uac04\uc758 \uc625\ud0c0\ub974\ub864\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uce74\uc6b4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(CLMBR), \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud45c \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc694\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778.", "result": "EHRSHOT \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub35f \uac00\uc9c0 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud3c9\uac00 \uacfc\uc81c\ub4e4\uc5d0\uc11c \uce74\uc6b4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud63c\ud569 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc29\ubc95 \uac04\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\uac00 \ube44\uc2b7\ud558\uac8c \ub098\uc654\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uce74\uc6b4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c EHR \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHR)\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uce74\uc6b4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ud63c\ud569 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uacfc \uc9c1\uc811 \ube44\uad50\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 EHRSHOT \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec EHR \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\ub2e4: LightGBM\uacfc \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \ube48\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc625\ud0c0\ub974\ub864\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uce74\uc6b4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(CLMBR), \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud45c \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc694\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud55c \ud6c4 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778.

However, this task is also difficult due to the\ncomplex cognition and decision-making involved in such behavior. Recent\nresearch has begun to leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task.\nBuilding on this, we introduce a novel dual-agent framework that enables\ncontinuous learning and alignment between LLM agents and human travelers on\nlearning and adaptation behavior from online data streams. Our approach\ninvolves a set of LLM traveler agents, equipped with a memory system and a\nlearnable persona, which serve as simulators for human travelers. To ensure\nbehavioral alignment, we introduce an LLM calibration agent that leverages the\nreasoning and analytical capabilities of LLMs to train the personas of these\ntraveler agents. Working together, this dual-agent system is designed to track\nand align the underlying decision-making mechanisms of travelers and produce\nrealistic, adaptive simulations. Using a real-world dataset from a day-to-day\nroute choice experiment, we show our approach significantly outperforms\nexisting LLM-based methods in both individual behavioral alignment and\naggregate simulation accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method\nmoves beyond simple behavioral mimicry to capture the evolution of underlying\nlearning processes, a deeper alignment that fosters robust generalization.\nOverall, our framework provides a new approach for creating adaptive and\nbehaviorally realistic agents to simulate travelers' learning and adaptation\nthat can benefit transportation

Prior work shows that attention is dominated by a small\nsubset of critical tokens, yet existing systems struggle to exploit this\nefficiently without degrading accuracy, especially in long generation. We make\na key observation: the temporal stability of these critical tokens varies\nsignificantly across KV heads: some heads consistently focus on the same\ntokens, while others shift frequently. Building on this insight, we introduce\nFlexiCache, a hierarchical KV-cache management system that leverages the\ntemporal stability of KV heads to reduce GPU memory usage and computation\noverhead, while preserving model accuracy. FlexiCache classifies KV heads as\nstable or unstable: it retains all KV-cache pages from unstable heads in GPU\nmemory, whereas for stable heads, it keeps only the top-K pages on the GPU and\noffloads the rest to host memory. By exploiting temporal stability, FlexiCache\nperforms periodic reranking for stable heads to fetch newly promoted top pages.\nImplemented atop vLLM, FlexiCache reduces GPU memory footprint for long-context\nrequests by up to 70%, improves offline serving throughput by 1.38-1.55x, and\nlowers online token latency by 1.6-2.1x, all while maintaining accuracy in\nlong-context, long-generation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlexiCache\ub294 KPI \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 KV-\uce90\uc2dc \uad00\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub294 \ud0a4-\uac12(KV) \uce90\uc2dc \ud06c\uae30 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "FlexiCache\ub294 KV \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc548\uc815\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0, \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \uc0c1\uc704 K \ud398\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc GPU\uc5d0 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ub098\uba38\uc9c0\ub294 \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub85c \uc624\ud504\ub85c\ub4dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FlexiCache\ub294 \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc694\uccad\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 70%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 1.38-1.55\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud1a0\ud070 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 1.6-2.1\ubc30 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FlexiCache\ub294 \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uae34 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uae38\uc774\uc640 \uc0dd\uc131 \uae38\uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\ub294 \ud0a4-\uac12(KV) \uce90\uc2dc\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc758(attention)\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uae34 \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774 KV \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e4\ub974\ub2e4\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ud588\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubd80 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uac19\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub2e4\ub978 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \uc790\uc8fc \ubcc0\uacbd\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 KV \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba70 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 KV-\uce90\uc2dc \uad00\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 FlexiCache\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Existing natural language processing (NLP) and machine\nlearning (ML) strategies often depend on large annotated datasets, limiting\ntheir scalability and adaptability. In this study, we introduce two Knowledge\nElicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer\nstaging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses\nan iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from\nunannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The\nsecond, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG),\nemploys a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant\nguidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and\navoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply\nbroad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer\npathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in\nidentifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches\non two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG\nwhen Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG\nachieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective.

KFCPO\nleverages K-FAC to perform efficient and stable natural gradient updates by\napproximating the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) in a layerwise, closed form\nmanner, avoiding iterative approximation overheads. To address the tradeoff\nbetween reward maximization and constraint satisfaction, we introduce a margin\naware gradient manipulation mechanism that adaptively adjusts the influence of\nreward and cost gradients based on the agent's proximity to safety boundaries.\nThis method blends gradients using a direction sensitive projection,\neliminating harmful interference and avoiding abrupt changes caused by fixed\nhard thresholds. Additionally, a minibatch level KL rollback strategy is\nadopted to ensure trust region compliance and to prevent destabilizing policy\nshifts. Experiments on Safety Gymnasium using OmniSafe show that KFCPO achieves\n10.3% to 50.2% higher average return across environments compared to the best\nbaseline that respected the safety constraint, demonstrating superior balance\nof safety and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "KFCPO\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc870\uc791\uacfc K-FAC \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc774\ucc28 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "KFCPO\ub294 K-FAC\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\uc154 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ubcc4\ub85c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub9c8\uc9c4 \uc778\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc870\uc791 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Safety Gymnasium\uc5d0\uc11c OmniSafe\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 KFCPO\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 10.3%\uc5d0\uc11c 50.2% \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KFCPO\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ucc45 \ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubbf8\ub2c8\ubc30\uce58 \uc218\uc900\uc758 KL \ub864\ubc31 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(Safe RL) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 KFCPO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud06c\ub85c\ub124\ucee4 \uc778\uc790\ud654 \uadfc\uc0ac \uace1\ub960(K-FAC) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc774\ucc28 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \uc548\uc804 \uc778\uc9c0\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc870\uc791\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge,\nbut these methods may introduce irrelevant retrieved documents, leading to\ninaccurate responses. While the integration methods filter out incorrect\nanswers from multiple responses, but lack external knowledge like RAG methods,\nand their high costs require balancing overhead with performance gains. To\naddress these issues, we propose an Efficient Test-Time Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration Framework named ET2RAG to improve the performance of LLMs while\nmaintaining efficiency. Specifically, ET2RAG is a training-free method, that\nfirst retrieves the most relevant documents and augments the LLMs to\nefficiently generate diverse candidate responses by managing response length.\nThen we compute the similarity of candidate responses and employ a majority\nvoting mechanism to select the most suitable response as the final output. In\nparticular, we discover that partial generation is sufficient to capture the\nkey information necessary for consensus calculation, allowing us to effectively\nperform majority voting without the need for fully generated responses. Thus,\nwe can reach a balance between computational cost and performance by managing\nthe response length for the number of retrieved documents for majority voting.\nExperimental results demonstrate that ET2RAG significantly enhances performance\nacross three tasks, including open-domain question answering, recipe generation\nand image captioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "ET2RAG\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLMs\ub294 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud30c\ub77c\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "ET2RAG\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uac00\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\ud558\uc5ec \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ET2RAG\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4: \uc624\ud508 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5, \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ucea1\uc154\ub2dd.", "conclusion": "\uc751\ub2f5 \uae38\uc774\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG)\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc RAG \ubc29\ubc95\ucc98\ub7fc \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba70, \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 '\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc810 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c'(ET2RAG)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c ET2RAG\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uba3c\uc800 \uac00\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc751\ub2f5 \uae38\uc774\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc751\ub2f5 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc218\uacb0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc7a5 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc885 \ucd9c\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud569\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc5ec, \uc644\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc218\uacb0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub2e4\uc218\uacb0\uc6a9 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc11c \uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5 \uae38\uc774\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8f0 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 ET2RAG\uac00 \uc624\ud508 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5, \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ucea1\uc154\ub2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 significantly \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this paper, we argue that data-savvy\ncapabilities should be a top priority in the design of agentic systems to\nensure reliable real-world deployment. Specifically, we propose four key\ncapabilities to realize this vision: (1) Proactive data acquisition: enabling\nagents to autonomously gather task-critical knowledge or solicit human input to\naddress data gaps; (2) Sophisticated data processing: requiring context-aware\nand flexible handling of diverse data challenges and inputs; (3) Interactive\ntest data synthesis: shifting from static benchmarks to dynamically generated\ninteractive test data for agent evaluation; and (4) Continual adaptation:\nempowering agents to iteratively refine their data and background knowledge to\nadapt to shifting environments.

On this basis, a modular decomposition mechanism is introduced to break\ndown the overall goal into multiple hierarchical sub-tasks. Then, dynamic\nscheduling and routing mechanisms enable reasonable division of labor and\nrealtime collaboration among agents, allowing the system to adjust strategies\ncontinuously according to environmental feedback, thus maintaining efficiency\nand stability in complex tasks. Furthermore, a constraint parsing and global\nconsistency mechanism is designed to ensure coherent connections between\nsub-tasks and balanced workload, preventing performance degradation caused by\nredundant communication or uneven resource allocation. The experiments validate\nthe architecture across multiple dimensions, including task success rate,\ndecomposition efficiency, sub-task coverage, and collaboration balance. The\nresults show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in both\noverall performance and robustness, achieving a better balance between task\ncomplexity and communication overhead. In conclusion, this study demonstrates\nthe effectiveness and feasibility of language-driven task decomposition and\ndynamic collaboration in multi-agent systems, providing a systematic solution\nfor task execution in complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \uc911 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c

We introduce our\nAdaptive Teaching and Learning System (ATLAS), a dual-agent architecture that\ndecouples reasoning (Teacher) from execution (Student) and incorporates a\npersistent learning memory that stores distilled guidance from experience. This\ninforms the orchestration layer, enabling the system to dynamically adjust its\noperational strategies, such as supervision level or initial plan selection, at\ninference time. In doing so, ATLAS achieves gradient-free continual learning,\nshifting the locus of adaptation from model parameters to system-level\norchestration. We formulate this as a system-centric paradigm for continual\nlearning, where the objective is adaptive efficiency: maximizing task success\nwhile minimizing computational cost through inference-time orchestration rather\nthan parameter updates.

The recent\nadvancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling new paradigm:\nNeural Compilation, which could potentially simplify compiler development for\nnew architectures and facilitate the discovery of innovative optimization\ntechniques. However, several critical obstacles impede its practical adoption.\nFirstly, a significant lack of dedicated benchmarks and robust evaluation\nmethodologies hinders objective assessment and tracking of progress in the\nfield. Secondly, systematically enhancing the reliability and performance of\nLLM-generated assembly remains a critical challenge. Addressing these\nchallenges, this paper introduces NeuComBack, a novel benchmark dataset\nspecifically designed for IR-to-assembly compilation. Leveraging this dataset,\nwe first define a foundational Neural Compilation workflow and conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of recent frontier LLMs on Neural\nCompilation, establishing new performance baselines. We further propose a\nself-evolving prompt optimization method that enables LLMs to iteratively\nevolve their internal prompt strategies by extracting insights from prior\nself-debugging traces, thereby enhancing their neural compilation capabilities.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves both the\nfunctional correctness and the performance of LLM-generated assembly code.\nCompared to baseline prompts, the functional correctness rates improved from\n44% to 64% on x86_64 and from 36% to 58% on aarch64, respectively.

Current OBO approaches rely on deterministic\n\\textit{window-smoothed} regret minimization, which may not accurately reflect\nsystem performance when functions change rapidly. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel search direction and show that both first- and zeroth-order (ZO)\nstochastic OBO algorithms leveraging this direction achieve sublinear\n{stochastic bilevel regret without window smoothing}. Beyond these guarantees,\nour framework enhances efficiency by: (i) reducing oracle dependence in\nhypergradient estimation, (ii) updating inner and outer variables alongside the\nlinear system solution, and (iii) employing ZO-based estimation of Hessians,\nJacobians, and gradients.

Jailbreaks, in\nwhich adversaries bypass safeguards with crafted input prompts, play a central\nrole in red-teaming by probing LLMs to elicit unintended or unsafe behaviors.\nRecent optimization-based jailbreak approaches iteratively refine attack\nprompts by leveraging LLMs. However, they often rely heavily on either binary\nattack success rate (ASR) signals, which are sparse, or manually crafted\nscoring templates, which introduce human bias and uncertainty in the scoring\noutcomes. To address these limitations, we introduce AMIS (Align to MISalign),\na meta-optimization framework that jointly evolves jailbreak prompts and\nscoring templates through a bi-level structure. In the inner loop, prompts are\nrefined using fine-grained and dense feedback using a fixed scoring template.\nIn the outer loop, the template is optimized using an ASR alignment score,\ngradually evolving to better reflect true attack outcomes across queries. This\nco-optimization process yields progressively stronger jailbreak prompts and\nmore calibrated scoring signals.

Le", "Phi Long Nguyen"], "title": "Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement Using Reinforcement Learning and Agent-Based Simulations", "comment": "Under Review", "summary": "The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates the strategic\nplacement of charging stations to optimize resource utilization and minimize\nuser inconvenience. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers an innovative approach\nto identifying optimal charging station locations; however, existing methods\nface challenges due to their deterministic reward systems, which limit\nefficiency. Because real-world conditions are dynamic and uncertain, a\ndeterministic reward structure cannot fully capture the complexities of\ncharging station placement. As a result, evaluation becomes costly and\ntime-consuming, and less reflective of real-world scenarios. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates deep RL with\nagent-based simulations to model EV movement and estimate charging demand in\nreal time. Our approach employs a hybrid RL agent with dual Q-networks to\nselect optimal locations and configure charging ports, guided by a hybrid\nreward function that combines deterministic factors with simulation-derived\nfeedback. Case studies in Hanoi, Vietnam, show that our method reduces average\nwaiting times by 53.28% compared to the initial state, outperforming static\nbaseline methods.

While most existing works focus on ML\ntechniques for static wireless environments, they often face limitations when\napplied to highly dynamic environments, such as flying ad hoc networks\n(FANETs). This paper explores the use of data-driven Koopman approaches to\naddress these challenges. Specifically, we investigate how these approaches can\nmodel UAV trajectory dynamics within FANETs, enabling more accurate predictions\nand improved network performance. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, we\npropose two possible approaches -- centralized and distributed -- to\nefficiently address the challenges posed by the constantly changing topology of\nFANETs. To demonstrate this, we consider a FANET performing surveillance with\nUAVs following pre-determined trajectories and predict\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) to ensure reliable\ncommunication between UAVs. Our results show that these approaches can\naccurately predict connectivity and isolation events that lead to modelled\ncommunication outages.

Our experiments show that this action-based reasoning process\nsignificantly improves calibrated accuracy, reducing the Brier score by 18\\%\ncompared to a non-interactive baseline. To validate the faithfulness of the\nagent's explanations, we introduce a causal intervention method. By masking the\nvisual evidence the agent chooses to use, we observe a measurable degradation\nin its performance ($\\Delta$Brier=+0.029), confirming that the evidence is\nintegral to its decision-making process.

Presents a real-domain in-place FFT (rdFFT)\n  operator for memory-efficient fine-tuning of large language models", "summary": "Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) are widely used to reduce memory and\ncomputational costs in deep learning. However, existing implementations,\nincluding standard FFT and real FFT (rFFT), cannot achieve true in-place\ncomputation. In particular, rFFT maps an input of size n to a complex output of\nsize n/2+1, causing dimensional mismatch and requiring additional memory\nallocation. We propose the first real-domain, fully in-place FFT framework\n(rdFFT) that preserves input-output memory space consistency. By leveraging\nbutterfly operation symmetry and conjugate properties in the frequency domain,\nwe design an implicit complex encoding scheme that eliminates intermediate\ncache usage entirely. Experiments on multiple natural language understanding\ntasks demonstrate the method effectiveness in reducing training memory cost,\noffering a promising direction for frequency-domain lightweight adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc81c\uc790\ub9ac \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 FFT \uad6c\ud604\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc804\uc2e4\uc218, \uc644\uc804 \uc81c\uc790\ub9ac FFT \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(rdFFT)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 FFT \ubc0f rFFT \uad6c\ud604\uc774 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294\ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, rFFT\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ucd9c\ub825 \ud06c\uae30 \uac04\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud560\ub2f9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc84\ud130\ud50c\ub77c\uc774 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc758 \ub300\uce6d\uc131\uacfc \uacf5\uc561 \uc131\uc9c8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uac04 \uce90\uc2dc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ubcf5\uc18c\uc218 \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\uc721 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube60\ub978 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ud658(FFT)\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uad6c\ud604, \ud45c\uc900 FFT \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc218 FFT(rFFT)\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc81c\uc790\ub9ac \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, rFFT\ub294 \ud06c\uae30 n\uc758 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uae30 n/2+1\uc758 \ubcf5\uc18c\uc218 \ucd9c\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\uc6d0 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uac00 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc785\ub825-\ucd9c\ub825 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc2e4\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc644\uc804 \uc81c\uc790\ub9ac FFT \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(rdFFT)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc84\ud130\ud50c\ub77c\uc774 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc758 \ub300\uce6d\uc131\uacfc \uacf5\uc561 \uc131\uc9c8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \uce90\uc2dc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ubcf5\uc18c\uc218 \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While pre-consultation processes\nencompassing triage and structured history-taking offer potential solutions,\nthey remain limited by passive interaction paradigms and context management\nchallenges in existing AI systems. This study introduces a hierarchical\nmulti-agent framework that transforms passive medical AI systems into proactive\ninquiry agents through autonomous task orchestration. We developed an\neight-agent architecture with centralized control mechanisms that decomposes\npre-consultation into four primary tasks: Triage ($T_1$), History of Present\nIllness collection ($T_2$), Past History collection ($T_3$), and Chief\nComplaint generation ($T_4$), with $T_1$--$T_3$ further divided into 13\ndomain-specific subtasks. Evaluated on 1,372 validated electronic health\nrecords from a Chinese medical platform across multiple foundation models\n(GPT-OSS 20B, Qwen3-8B, Phi4-14B), the framework achieved 87.0% accuracy for\nprimary department triage and 80.5% for secondary department classification,\nwith task completion rates reaching 98.2% using agent-driven scheduling versus\n93.1% with sequential processing. Clinical quality scores from 18 physicians\naveraged 4.56 for Chief Complaints, 4.48 for History of Present Illness, and\n4.69 for Past History on a 5-point scale, with consultations completed within\n12.7 rounds for $T_2$ and 16.9 rounds for $T_3$. The model-agnostic\narchitecture maintained high performance across different foundation models\nwhile preserving data privacy through local deployment, demonstrating the\npotential for autonomous AI

Yet, it remains\nunderexplored whether LLM agents can tackle compounding real-world problems\nthat require a diverse set of tools to complete. Given a broad, heterogeneous\ntool repository, LLM agents must not only select appropriate tools based on\ntask planning analysis but also strategically schedule the execution order to\nensure efficiency. This paper introduces TPS-Bench to benchmark the ability of\nLLM agents in solving such problems that demand Tool Planning and Scheduling.\nTPS-Bench collects 200 compounding tasks of two difficulty levels, based on a\ntool repository containing hundreds of model context protocol (MCP) tools. In\nparticular, each task is composed of multiple subtasks, such as web search, map\nnavigation, calendar checking, etc., and each subtask can be completed by a\nbasic tool. Our evaluation emphasizes both task completion rate and efficiency.\nThe empirical studies on popular closed-source and open-source LLMs indicate\nthat most models can perform reasonable tool planning, but differ in\nscheduling. For example, GLM-4.5 achieves an outperforming task completion rate\nof 64.72% with extensive sequential tool calls, hence suffering from\nsignificantly long execution time. By contrast, GPT-4o prioritizes parallel\ntool calls but achieves only a 45.08% completion rate. Considering\nreinforcement learning (RL) can be a viable way to improve the scheduling\nefficiency without compromising performance, we perform an initial study on\nQwen3-1.7B and witness a 14% reduction in execution time alongside a 6% gain in\ntask completion rate based on rarely 100 RL training samples.

However, state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods-including HIVE-COTE, Proximity Forest, and TS-CHIEF-exhibit high\ncomputational complexity, coupled with lengthy parameter tuning and training\ncycles. In contrast, lightweight solutions like ROCKET (Random Convolutional\nKernel Transform) offer greater efficiency but leave substantial room for\nimprovement in kernel selection and computational overhead. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a feature extraction approach based on Hadamard\nconvolutional transform, utilizing column or row vectors of Hadamard matrices\nas convolution kernels with extended lengths of varying sizes.

We present GLM, the first\nmulti-agent Graph-CoT system co-designed with an optimized LLM serving\narchitecture. GLM decomposes reasoning into specialized agents for\nclassification, reasoning, action generation, and graph retrieval, enabling\nbranching and selective context sharing to reduce prompt length and reasoning\niterations while preserving reasoning quality, thereby improving accuracy and\nreducing overall token consumption. To scale inference, we introduce a\nGraph-CoT-aware LLM inference mechanism with graph-specific KV-cache\nmanagement, priority-based eviction, and pipelined execution to improve serving\nefficiency. Experiments demonstrate that GLM improves answer accuracy by up to\n38%, reduces token cost by up to 95.7%, lowers inference latency by 90.3%, and\nachieves up to 15.1x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art Graph-CoT\nbaselines, enabling efficient adoption for complex real-world reasoning at\nscale.", "AI": {"tldr": "GLM\uc740 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 Graph-CoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uace0 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 Graph-CoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "GLM\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4(\ubd84\ub958, \ucd94\ub860, \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uac80\uc0c9 \ub4f1)\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud2b9\ud654 KV-\uce90\uc2dc \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc11c\ube59\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GLM\uc740 \ub2f5\ubcc0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 38% \ub192\uc774\uace0, \ud1a0\ud070 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 95.7% \uc904\uc774\uba70, \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 90.3% \ub0ae\ucd94\uc5b4 15.1\ubc30 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GLM\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc0ac\uc2ac(Graph Chain-of-Thought, Graph-CoT)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc7ac\uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc0f \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc11c\ube59 \uc2e4\ud589\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9, \ub192\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc0f \ub0ae\uc740 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c LLM \uc11c\ube59 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 Graph-CoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 GLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

We present\na hybrid legal QA agent tailored for judicial settings that integrates\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-model ensembling to deliver\nreliable, auditable, and continuously updatable counsel. The system prioritizes\nretrieval over generation: when a trusted legal repository yields relevant\nevidence, answers are produced via RAG; otherwise, multiple LLMs generate\ncandidates that are scored by a specialized selector, with the top-ranked\nanswer returned. High-quality outputs then undergo human review before being\nwritten back to the repository, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and\nprovenance tracking. Experiments on the Law\\_QA dataset show that our hybrid\napproach significantly outperforms both a single-model baseline and a vanilla\nRAG pipeline on F1, ROUGE-L, and an LLM-as-a-Judge metric.

Speculative decoding offers a\npromising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft\nmodel on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but\nsuffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the\nfirst to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association\nand resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative\ndecoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement\nlearning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we\nconduct experiments using the Sionna simulator. Results show that our method\nachieves up to 28.0% and an average of 23.7% reduction in end-to-end latency\nwithout compromising inference accuracy, enabling scalable and low-latency LLM\nservices in MEC systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305(MEC)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubcd1\ub82c \ucd94\uce21 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5f0\uacb0 \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 UARA \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc218\uc694\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305(MEC) \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5f0\uacb0 \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9(UARA) \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd5c\ub300 28.0% \ubc0f \ud3c9\uade0 23.7%\uc758 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MEC \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ub0ae\uc740 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 LLM \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc218\uc694\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305(MEC) \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\uce21\uc801 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub4dc\ub798\ud504\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc11c\ubc84\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud0c0\uae43 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \ubc0f \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubcd1\ub82c \ucd94\uce21 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5f0\uacb0 \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9(UARA)\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec UARA \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Sionna \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 28.0% \ubc0f \ud3c9\uade0 23.7%\uc758 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, MEC \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc758 LLM \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Real stochastic processes\nexhibit a degree of memory effects (correlations in time), long-range\ndependencies, roughness and anomalous diffusion phenomena that are not captured\nin standard diffusion or bridge modeling due to the use of Brownian motion\n(BM). As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM),\nwe construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the\nnon-Markovian nature of fBM. We prove the existence of a coupling-preserving\ngenerative diffusion bridge and leverage it for future state prediction from\npaired training data. We then extend our formulation to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nbridge problem and derive a principled loss function to learn the unpaired data\ntranslation. We evaluate FDBM on both tasks: predicting future protein\nconformations from aligned data, and unpaired image translation. In both\nsettings, FDBM achieves superior performance compared to the Brownian\nbaselines, yielding lower root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of C$_\\alpha$\natomic positions in protein structure

However, while\nsafer than radiation-based imaging and more suitable for patients with medical\nimplants, ultrasound suffers from attenuation with depth, limiting the quality\nof the image. Despite advances in echocardiographic particle image velocimetry\n(EchoPIV), accurately measuring blood velocity remains challenging due to the\ntechnique's limitations and the complexity of blood flow dynamics.\nPhysics-informed machine learning can enhance accuracy and robustness,\nparticularly in scenarios where noisy or incomplete data challenge purely\ndata-driven approaches. We present a physics-informed neural field model with\nmulti-scale Fourier Feature encoding for estimating blood flow from sparse and\nnoisy ultrasound data without requiring ground truth supervision. We\ndemonstrate that this model achieves consistently low mean squared error in\ndenoising and inpainting both synthetic and real datasets, verified against\nreference flow fields and ground truth flow rate measurements. While\nphysics-informed neural fields have been widely used to reconstruct medical\nimages, applications to medical flow reconstruction are mostly prominent in\nFlow MRI. In this work, we adapt methods that have proven effective in other\nimaging modalities to address the specific challenge of ultrasound-based flow\nreconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud608\ub958\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub274\ub7f4 \ud544\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud608\ub958 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc2ec\uc7a5 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c\ub294 \uc2ec\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac10\uc1e0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub274\ub7f4 \ud544\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc73c\ub85c \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud608\ub958\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc81c\uac70 \ubc0f \uc778\ud398\uc778\ud2b8\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub0ae\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud750\ub984 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud2b9\uc815 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc751\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud608\ub958\ub294 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uba70 \uc2ec\uc7a5 \uae30\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uac00\uce58\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ub8cc \uc784\ud50c\ub780\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ub354 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c\ub294 \uae4a\uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac10\uc1e0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\ucf54 \uc2ec\ucd08\uc74c\ud30c \uc785\uc790 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc18d\ub3c4\uce21\uc815\ubc95(EchoPIV)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud608\ub958 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud608\ub958 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc21c\uc218 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c4\uc2e4 \uae30\uc900 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud608\ub958\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \ub274\ub7f4 \ud544\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucc38\uc870 \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc\uc640 \uc9c4\uc2e4 \uae30\uc900 \ud750\ub984 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc81c\uac70 \ubc0f \uc778\ud398\uc778\ud2b8\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \ub274\ub7f4 \ud544\ub4dc\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc758\ub8cc \ud750\ub984 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc5d0\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud750\ub984 MRI\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c \uae30\ubc18 \ud750\ub984 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc751\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
