As a key technology within it, Agentic AI has garnered growing attention due to its advanced cognitive capabilities, enabled through continuous perception-memory-reasoning-action cycles. This paper first analyses the unique advantages that Agentic AI introduces to intellicise wireless networks. We then propose a structured taxonomy for Agentic AI-enhanced secure intellicise wireless networks. Building on this framework, we identify emerging security and privacy challenges introduced by Agentic AI and summarize targeted strategies to address these vulnerabilities. A case study further demonstrates Agentic AI's efficacy in defending against intelligent eavesdropping attacks. Finally, we outline key open research directions to guide future exploration in this field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \ubcf4\uac15\ud55c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc0ac\uc774\uc988 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \ud574\uacb0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc0ac\uc774\uc988 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc0ac\uc774\uc988 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4 \uc81c\uc548 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \ud574\uacb0 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc694\uc57d.", "result": "\uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ub3c4\uccad \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc0ac\uc774\uc988(\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac04\uacb0\ud55c) \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \ud559\uacc4\uc640 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc778\uc815\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc548\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\uc220\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc9c0-\uae30\uc5b5-\ucd94\ub860-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\uae09 \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uc5ec \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc0ac\uc774\uc988 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uac15\ud654 \uc548\uc804 \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc0ac\uc774\uc988 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc694\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ub3c4\uccad \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc798 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud560 \uc8fc\uc694 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uac04\ub7b5\ud788 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This design improves performance on long-horizon tasks but creates a security risk: untrusted external content observed during a benign session can be stored as memory and later treated as instruction. We study this risk and formalize a persistent attack we call a Zombie Agent, where an attacker covertly implants a payload that survives across sessions, effectively turning the agent into a puppet of the attacker.\n  We present a black-box attack framework that uses only indirect exposure through attacker-controlled web content. The attack has two phases. During infection, the agent reads a poisoned source while completing a benign task and writes the payload into long-term memory through its normal update process. During trigger, the payload is retrieved or carried forward and causes unauthorized tool behavior. We design mechanism-specific persistence strategies for common memory implementations, including sliding-window and retrieval-augmented memory, to resist truncation and relevance filtering. We evaluate the attack on representative agent setups and tasks, measuring both persistence over time and the ability to induce unauthorized actions while preserving benign task quality. Our results show that memory evolution can convert one-time indirect injection into persistent compromise, which suggests that defenses focused only on per-session prompt filtering are not sufficient for self-evolving agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc138\uc158 \uac04 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c

However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub098, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec \uae30\ubc18 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828(DAT)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM(\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc744 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc801\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubd84\ud3ec \uae30\ubc18 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828(DAT)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud655\uc0b0 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uacb0\ud569 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \ub192\uc740 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DAT\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc790\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacfc\uac70 \uc2dc\uc81c\ub85c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc4f0\uac70\ub098 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc778\ub514\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubdf0\uc158 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\ud55c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \ubcf4\uc774\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd84\ud3ec \uae30\ubc18 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828(DAT)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uacb0\ud569 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uace0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While foundational architectures and local context management protocols have been established, the challenge of cross-platform, decentralized, and secure interaction remains a significant barrier to the realization of a truly Agentic Web. Building upon the foundations of AI agent architectures and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for multi-agent coordination, this paper introduces the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP). ACP provides a standardized framework for Agent-to-Agent (AA) interaction, enabling heterogeneous agents to discover, negotiate, and execute collaborative workflows across disparate environments. We propose a federated orchestration model that integrates decentralized identity verification, semantic intent mapping, and automated service-level agreements. Our evaluation demonstrates that ACP reduces inter-agent communication latency by % while maintaining a zero-trust security posture.

Specifically, we combine time series embeddings extracted from a Granite TinyTimeMixer encoder fine-tuned with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and 28 types of statistical features including trend, volatility, and drawdown indicators, which are then learned using a LightGBM gradient boosting classifier. In experiments using 64 equipment units and 51,564 samples, we achieved Precision of 91--95\\% and ROC-AUC of 0.995 for anomaly prediction at 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day horizons. Furthermore, we achieved production-ready performance with a false positive rate of 1.1\\% or less and a detection rate of 88--94\\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the system for predictive maintenance applications. This work demonstrates that practical anomaly detection systems can be realized by leveraging the complementary strengths between deep learning's representation learning capabilities and statistical feature engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 HVAC \uc7a5\ube44 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uac00 \uc7a5\ube44 \uc608\uce21 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc21c\uc218 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4.", "method": "Granite TinyTimeMixer\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c 64\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uacfc \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 28\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec, LoRA\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c LightGBM \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubd80\uc2a4\ud305 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "64\uac1c \uc7a5\ube44 \ub2e8\uc704\uc640 51,564\uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc758 Precision\uc740 91-95%, ROC-AUC\ub294 0.995\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131 \uacf5\ud559\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7a5\ube44\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uac00 \ud070 \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc21c\uc218 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 HVAC \uc7a5\ube44 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 Granite TinyTimeMixer\uc5d0\uc11c 64\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uacfc \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c 28\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, LoRA(\uc800\uc21c\uc704 \uc801\uc751)\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c Granite TinyTimeMixer \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uacfc \ucd94\uc138, \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131, \uc190\uc2e4 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c 28\uc885\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774\ub97c LightGBM \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubd80\uc2a4\ud305 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 64\uac1c \uc7a5\ube44 \ub2e8\uc704\uc640 51,564\uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 30\uc77c, 60\uc77c, 90\uc77c \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc758 Precision\uc740 91--95%\uc774\uace0 ROC-AUC\ub294 0.995\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, 1.1% \uc774\ud558\uc758 \uc704\uc591\uc131\ub960\uacfc 88--94%\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub960\ub85c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131 \uacf5\ud559 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This surfaces a unique safety problem when individual agents form a coalition and \\emph{collude} to pursue secondary goals and degrade the joint objective. In this paper, we present Colosseum, a framework for auditing LLM agents' collusive behavior in multi-agent settings. We ground how agents cooperate through a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) and measure collusion via regret relative to the cooperative optimum. Colosseum tests each LLM for collusion under different objectives, persuasion tactics, and network topologies. Through our audit, we show that most out-of-the-box models exhibited a propensity to collude when a secret communication channel was artificially formed. Furthermore, we discover ``collusion on paper'' when agents plan to collude in text but would often pick non-collusive actions, thus providing little effect on the joint task. Colosseum provides a new way to study collusion by measuring communications and actions in rich yet verifiable environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc790\uc720\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \uc18c\ud1b5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud611\ub825 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5f0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2f4\ud569 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Colosseum\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud611\ub825 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub2f4\ud569\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c(DCOP)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uace0, \ud611\ub825 \ucd5c\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub2f4\ud569\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ube44\ubc00 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ucc44\ub110\uc774 \uc778\uc704\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc131\ub418\uc5c8\uc744 \ub54c \ub300\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub2f4\ud569 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2f4\ud569\ud560 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc138\uc6e0\uc9c0\ub9cc \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub3c4 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Colosseum\uc740 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub2f4\ud569\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \uc989 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc790\uc720\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc18c\ud1b5\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud611\ub825 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5f0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \ub54c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2f4\ud569 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Colosseum\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c(DCOP)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uace0, \ud611\ub825 \ucd5c\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2f4\ud569\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite its privacy-preserving benefits, FL has significant drawbacks, including slow convergence, high communication cost, and non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data. In this work, we present a novel FedAvg variation called Fractional-Order Federated Averaging (FOFedAvg), which incorporates Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (FOSGD) to capture long-range relationships and deeper historical information. By introducing memory-aware fractional-order updates, FOFedAvg improves communication efficiency and accelerates convergence while mitigating instability caused by heterogeneous, non-IID client data. We compare FOFedAvg against a broad set of established federated optimization algorithms on benchmark datasets including MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, EMNIST, the Cleveland heart disease dataset, Sent140, PneumoniaMNIST, and Edge-IIoTset. Across a range of non-IID partitioning schemes, FOFedAvg is competitive with, and often outperforms, these baselines in terms of test performance and convergence speed. On the theoretical side, we prove that FOFedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions for fractional order $0<\u03b1\\le 1$. Together, these results show that fractional-order, memory-aware updates can substantially improve the robustness and effectiveness of federated learning, offering a practical path toward distributed training on heterogeneous data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fractional-Order Federated Averaging (FOFedAvg)\ub294 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ub3d9\uc9c8 \ubd84\ud3ec(non-IID) \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uc6d0\uaca9 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc FL\uc740 \ub290\ub9b0 \uc218\ub834, \ub192\uc740 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9, \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc77c \ubd84\ubc30(non-IID) \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (FOSGD)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud3c9\uade0(FedAvg) \ubcc0\ud615\uc778 Fractional-Order Federated Averaging (FOFedAvg)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc778\uc2dd \ubd84\uc218 \ucc28\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FOFedAvg\ub294 MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, EMNIST, \ud074\ub9ac\ube14\ub79c\ub4dc \uc2ec\uc7a5 \uc9c8\ud658 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b, Sent140, PneumoniaMNIST, Edge-IIoTset \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, FOFedAvg\ub294 \ubd84\uc218 \ucc28\uc218 $0<\u03b1\tle 1$\uc758 \ud45c\uc900 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc815\uc801 \uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubd84\uc218 \ucc28\uc218 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc778\uc2dd \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uac15 robustness\uc640 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uc6d0\uaca9 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, FL\uc740 \ub290\ub9b0 \uc218\ub834, \ub192\uc740 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ub3d9\uc9c8 \ubd84\ud3ec(non-IID) \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \uad00\uacc4\uc640 \ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (FOSGD)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 FedAvg \ubcc0\ud615\uc778 Fractional-Order Federated Averaging (FOFedAvg)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc778\uc2dd \ubd84\uc218 \ucc28\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, FOFedAvg\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \ube44\ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ub3d9\uc9c8 \ubd84\ud3ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length.

Advancements in computational processing and storage have facilitated the adoption of ABMs across many fields; however, ABMs face challenges that limit their use as decision-support tools. A significant issue is parameter estimation in large-scale ABMs, particularly due to computational constraints on exploring the parameter space. This study evaluates a state-of-the-art simulation-based inference (SBI) framework that uses neural networks (NN) for parameter estimation. This framework is applied to an established labour market ABM based on job transition networks. The ABM is initiated with synthetic datasets and the real U.S. labour market. Next, we compare the effectiveness of summary statistics derived from a list of statistical measures with that learned by an embedded NN.

In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, these problems are often addressed by incorporating intrinsic drives that encourage prosocial or fair behavior. However, most existing methods assume that agents face identical incentives in the dilemma and require continuous access to global information about other agents to assess fairness. In this work, we introduce asymmetric variants of well-known SSD environments and examine how natural differences between agents influence cooperation dynamics. Our findings reveal that existing fairness-based methods struggle to adapt under asymmetric conditions by enforcing raw equality that wrongfully incentivize defection. To address this, we propose three modifications: (i) redefining fairness by accounting for agents' reward ranges, (ii) introducing an agent-based weighting mechanism to better handle inherent asymmetries, and (iii) localizing social feedback to make the methods effective under partial observability without requiring global information sharing. Experimental results show that in asymmetric scenarios, our method fosters faster emergence of cooperative policies compared to existing approaches, without sacrificing scalability or practicality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\ubcc4 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c\uac00 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ubcf5\uc9c0\uc640 \ucda9\ub3cc\ud560 \ub54c \ud611\ub825\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Sequential Social Dilemmas (SSDs) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\ub300\uce6d SSD \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc815\uc758\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \ud611\ub825 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\uc18d \uc0ac\ud68c \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8(SSD)\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \uc720\uc778\uacfc \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ubcf5\uc9c0\uac00 \uc0c1\ucda9\ud560 \ub54c \ud611\ub825\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc885\uc885 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc720\uc778\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uc815\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc561\uc138\uc2a4\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 SSD \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ud611\ub825 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ud3c9\ub4f1\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc801\uc751\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc7ac\uc815\uc758 \ud558\uace0, (ii) \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc798 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, (iii) \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc815\ubcf4 \uacf5\uc720 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \ud611\ub825 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774\ub098 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A Contrast in Risky Choices Between Reasoning and Conversational LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "The use of large language models either as decision support systems, or in agentic workflows, is rapidly transforming the digital ecosystem. However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc774\ud574\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \uc2ec\uce35\uc801 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ub3c4\ubaa8\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "20\uac1c\uc758 \uc120\uc9c4 \ubc0f \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 LLM\uacfc \ub9e4\uce6d\ub41c \uc778\uac04 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(RMs)\uacfc \ub300\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378(CMs)\ub85c \ub098\ub258\uba70, RMs\ub294 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 CMs\ub294 \ub35c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc0ac\ub78c\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 RMs\uc640 CMs\ub97c \uad6c\ubd84\uc9d3\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc18c\uc784\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc740 \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub610\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0(1) \uc804\ub9dd \ud45c\ud604(\uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ub300 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18), (2) \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uadfc\uac70(\uc124\uba85)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud55c\ub2e4. 20\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc804\uc120 \ubc0f \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 LLM\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\uce6d\ub41c \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ud5d8\uc790 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ub418\uba70, \ub610 \ub2e4\ub978 \uae30\uc900\uc810\uc740 \uae30\ub313\uac12 \uadf9\ub300\ud654 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(RMs)\uacfc \ub300\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378(CMs) \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.

Yet many studies still emphasize point-level results on curated base datasets, limiting value for model selection in practice. We introduce an evaluation protocol with unified event-level augmentations that simulate real-world issues: calibrated sensor dropout, linear and log drift, additive noise, and window shifts. We also perform sensor-level probing via mask-as-missing zeroing with per-channel influence estimation to support root-cause analysis. We evaluate 14 representative models on five public anomaly datasets (SWaT, WADI, SMD, SKAB, TEP) and two industrial datasets (steam turbine, nuclear turbogenerator) using unified splits and event aggregation. There is no universal winner: graph-structured models transfer best under dropout and long events (e.g., on SWaT under additive noise F1 drops 0.804->0.677 for a graph autoencoder, 0.759->0.680 for a graph-attention variant, and 0.762->0.756 for a hybrid graph attention model); density/flow models work well on clean stationary plants but can be fragile to monotone drift; spectral CNNs lead when periodicity is strong; reconstruction autoencoders become competitive after basic sensor vetting; predictive/hybrid dynamics help when faults break temporal dependencies but remain window-sensitive. The protocol also informs design choices: on SWaT under log drift, replacing normalizing flows with Gaussian density reduces high-stress F1 from ~0.75 to ~0.57, and fixing a learned DAG gives a small clean-set gain (~0.5-1.0 points) but increases drift sensitivity by ~8x.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc548\uc804 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442ical IoT \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294

Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are validated using a practical agentic AI system based on Qwen, demonstrating satisfactory reasoning accuracy across various public benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud488\uc9c8(QoS)\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ubb34\uc120 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uae30\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud488\uc9c8(QoS)\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c AI \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "\uac10\ub3c5 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud560 \ub2e4\ub978 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uba70, \uc120\uc815\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc801\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubc29\uc548\uc778 ASC\uc640 LAW\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \uae30\uc900\u65b9\u6848\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 59.1% \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uac1c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9cc\uc871\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud488\uc9c8(QoS)\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac10\ub3c5 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ubb34\uc120 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uac10\ub3c5 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud560 \ub2e4\ub978 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc120\ud0dd\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uce5c\uc808\ud55c \ubc29\ud574\uafbc \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uccad\uc790\uc758 \uc218\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\\% and precision by 15\\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\\% increase in recall and 1\\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

However, practical implementations face two key limitations: error signals must still propagate from the output to early layers through multiple inference-phase steps, and feedback decays exponentially during this process, leading to vanishing updates in early layers. We propose direct Kolen-Pollack predictive coding (DKP-PC), which simultaneously addresses both feedback delay and exponential decay, yielding a more efficient and scalable variant of PC while preserving update locality. Leveraging direct feedback alignment and direct Kolen-Pollack algorithms, DKP-PC introduces learnable feedback connections from the output layer to all hidden layers, establishing a direct pathway for error transmission. This yields an algorithm that reduces the theoretical error propagation time complexity from O(L), with L being the network depth, to O(1), removing depth-dependent delay in error signals. Moreover, empirical results demonstrate that DKP-PC achieves performance at least comparable to, and often exceeding, that of standard PC, while offering improved latency and computational performance, supporting its potential for custom hardware-efficient implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc9c1\uc811 Kolen-Pollack \uc608\uce21 \ucf54\ub529(DKP-PC)\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \ucf54\ub529\uc758 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc218\uc801 \uac10\uc18c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcc0\uc885\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub85c\uceec \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub9cc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcd1\ub82c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \ucf54\ub529\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "DKP-PC\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825\uce35\uacfc \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc740\ub2c9\uce35 \uac04\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc624\ub958 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c1\uc811 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc624\ub958 \uc804\ud30c \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c O(L)\uc5d0\uc11c O(1)\ub85c \uc904\uc5ec \uc624\ub958 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0\uc11c \uae4a\uc774 \uc758\uc874\uc801 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DKP-PC\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc608\uce21 \ucf54\ub529\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70, \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uad6c\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc608\uce21 \ucf54\ub529(PC)\uc740 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c, \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub9cc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uce35 \uac04 \ubcd1\ub82c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc624\ub958 \uc2e0\ud638\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd94\uc815 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd08\uae30 \uacc4\uce35\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud30c\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacfc\uc815 \ub3d9\uc548 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc740 \uc9c0\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uc5ec \ucd08\uae30 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \uc9c0\uc218\uc801 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811 Kolen-Pollack \uc608\uce21 \ucf54\ub529(DKP-PC)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c PC \ubcc0\uc885\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c1\uc811 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc815\ub82c\uacfc \uc9c1\uc811 Kolen-Pollack \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, DKP-PC\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825\uce35\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc740\ub2c9\uce35\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ub958 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c1\uc811 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc624\ub958 \uc804\ud30c \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uae4a\uc774 L\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 O(L)\uc5d0\uc11c O(1)\ub85c \uc904\uc5ec \uc624\ub958 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uae4a\uc774 \uc758\uc874\uc801 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 DKP-PC\uac00 \ud45c\uc900 PC\uc640 \uc801\uc5b4\ub3c4 \ube44\uc2b7\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc885\uc885 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc131\ub2a5\ub3c4 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uad6c\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Dean"], "title": "When Remembering and Planning are Worth it: Navigating under Change", "comment": null, "summary": "We explore how different types and uses of memory can aid spatial navigation in changing uncertain environments. In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc720\ud615\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uac00 \uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc218\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ucc44\uc9d1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc74c\uc2dd \uc704\uce58\ub97c \uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud55c, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud655\ub960 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc720\ud615\uacfc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ucc44\uc9d1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c, \ub9e4\uc77c \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uadf8\uc758 \uc9d1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc744 \uc9c0\ub098 \uc74c\uc2dd\uae4c\uc9c0 \ucc3e\uc544\uac00\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774 \uc138\uacc4\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ub9e4\uc77c \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uacfc \uc74c\uc2dd\uc758 \uc704\uce58\uac00 \ubc14\ub014 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc704\uce58 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uac10\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\uace0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9f5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uad6c\ucd95 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uac15\uac74\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubd05\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc74c\uc2dd \uc704\uce58\ub97c \uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud788 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc131\uaca9\uc758 (\ud558\uc704) \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud655\ub960 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec (\uc77c\ud654\uc801) \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9f5\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uc989\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uac70\ub9ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c (\ucd5c\uc18c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

EAA integrates multimodal reasoning, tool-augmented action, and optional long-term memory to support both autonomous procedures and interactive user-guided measurements. Built on a flexible task-manager architecture, the system enables workflows ranging from fully agent-driven automation to logic-defined routines that embed localized LLM queries. EAA further provides a modern tool ecosystem with two-way compatibility for Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing instrument-control tools to be consumed or served across applications.

To alleviate this conflict, we propose an optimization-based unsupervised learning approach based on the wireless transformer (WiT) architecture that learns from channel state information (CSI) features. We reformulate the trade-off by combining the sum rate and fairness objectives through a Lagrangian multiplier, which is updated automatically via a dual-ascent algorithm. This mechanism allows for a controllable fairness constraint while simultaneously maximizing the sum rate, effectively realizing a trace on the Pareto front between two conflicting objectives. Our findings show that the proposed approach offers a flexible solution for managing the trade-off optimization under prescribed fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb34\uc120 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacf5\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c\uc11c, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 WiT \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb34\uc120 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud569\uc0b0 \ube44\uc728 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube44\ubcfc\ub85d \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucc44\ub110 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc815\ubcf4(CSI) \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubb34\uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 WiT \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub77c\uadf8\ub791\uc8fc \uc2b9\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud569\uc0b0 \ube44\uc728 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \uc2b9\uc218\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc0c1\uc2b9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud569\uc0b0 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc870\uc808 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\ud574\uc9c4 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uae30\uc900 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uade0\ud615 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc120 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacf5\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud569\uc0b0\uc728 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\ubcfc\ub85d \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucc44\ub110 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc815\ubcf4(CSI) \uae30\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubb34\uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub77c\uadf8\ub791\uc8fc \uc2b9\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud569\uc0b0 \ube44\uc728\uacfc \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc2b9\uc218\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc0c1\uc2b9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ud569\uc0b0 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc870\uc808 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ucda9 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \uc804\uc120\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc815\ud574\uc9c4 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb34\uc5ed \uc624\ud504 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual \"what-if\" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub18d\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c

In systems with a dominant attractor -- homeostatic physiology, nominal industrial operation, stable network traffic -- this creates a systematic \\emph{Stationarity Bias}: simple methods appear superior because the benchmark predominantly samples the easy, low-entropy regime where they trivially succeed. We formalize this bias and propose a \\emph{Stratified Stress-Test} that partitions evaluation into Stationary and Transient regimes. Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) as a testbed -- chosen for its rigorous ground-truth forcing functions (meals, insulin) that enable precise regime identification -- we establish three findings with broad implications:(i)~Stationary Efficiency: Linear interpolation achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction during stable intervals, confirming that complex architectures are computationally wasteful in low-entropy regimes.(ii)~Transient Fidelity: During critical transients (post-prandial peaks, hypoglycemic events), linear methods exhibit drastically degraded morphological fidelity (DTW), disproportionate to their RMSE -- a phenomenon we term the \\emph{RMSE Mirage}, where low pointwise error masks the destruction of signal shape.(iii)~Regime-Conditional Model Selection: Deep learning models preserve both pointwise accuracy and morphological integrity during transients, making them essential for safety-critical downstream tasks. We further derive empirical missingness distributions from clinical trials and impose them on complete training data, preventing models from exploiting unrealistically clean observations and encouraging robustness under real-world missingness. This framework generalizes to any regulated system where routine stationarity dominates critical transients.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubcf4\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uaddc \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\uacfc \ud615\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc9c0\ud45c\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc154\ub108\ub9ac \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc154\ub108\ub9ac \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ud615\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc154\ub108\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc81c\uc548.", "method": "\uc5f0\uc18d \ud608\ub2f9 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1(CGM)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uae30\uc900 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00.", "result": "1) \uc120\ud615 \ubcf4\uac04\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568. 2) \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae09\uc131 \uacfc\ub3c4\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ud638 \ud615\ud0dc \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud568. 3) \uae4a\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacfc\ub3c4\uae30 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc810 \ubc00\ub3c4 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud615\ud0dc\uc801 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc874.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\ub3c4\uae30 \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubcf4\uac04 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\uacfc \ud615\ud0dc \ube44\uad6c\uc18d \uc9c0\ud45c(MSE, RMSE)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\ub3c4\uc801 \uc6b0\uc704\ub85c \uac00\uc911\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\ub825\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(\ub3d9\ud615 \uc0dd\ub9ac\ud559, \uba85\ubaa9\uc0c1 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc6b4\uc601, \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d) \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \textit{\uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc154\ub108\ub9ac \ud3b8\ud5a5}\uc744 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2f5\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \uc5bb\ub294 \uc800 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uac8c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ud615\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc154\ub108\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub204\ub294 \textit{\uacc4\uce35 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8}\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uc18d \ud608\ub2f9 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1(CGM)\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uae30\uc900 \uae30\ub2a5(\uc2dd\uc0ac, \uc778\uc290\ub9b0)\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub113\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc138\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i)~\uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc154\ub108\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc131: \uc120\ud615 \ubcf4\uac04\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uac04\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc800 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0ad\ube44\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary.

Building upon the agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) capabilities of its predecessor, GLM-5 adopts DSA to significantly reduce training and inference costs while maintaining long-context fidelity. To advance model alignment and autonomy, we implement a new asynchronous reinforcement learning infrastructure that drastically improves post-training efficiency by decoupling generation from training. Furthermore, we propose novel asynchronous agent RL algorithms that further improve RL quality, enabling the model to learn from complex, long-horizon interactions more effectively. Through these innovations, GLM-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major open benchmarks. Most critically, GLM-5 demonstrates unprecedented capability in real-world coding tasks, surpassing previous baselines in handling end-to-end software engineering challenges.

But it has another property: $C(C\u03c6\\rightarrow \u03c6)$ -- corresponding to so-called shift-reflexivity (reflexivity one step ahead). This observation begs the question:\n  is KD4 extended with this axiom a complete characterisation of common belief in the KD45 case? If not, what \\emph{is} the logic of common belief? In this paper we show that the answer to the first question is ``no'': there is one additional axiom, and, furthermore, it relies on the number of agents. We show that the result is a complete characterisation of common belief, settling the open problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ub150\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c KD4\uc758 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ubbff\uc74c\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, KD45\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \uacf5\ub9ac\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ub150\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc624\ud574\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "KD45 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ub150\uc758 \uc131\uc9c8\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\uac00 \uacf5\ub9ac\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568.", "result": "KD4\uc5d0 \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \uacf5\ub9ac\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ucd94\uac00 \uacf5\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 KD45 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "translated_summary": "\uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubbff\uc74c\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubbff\uc74c\uc740 KD4\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \ubbff\uc74c\uc774 KD45\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubbff\uc74c\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c 5 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc783\uace0 D\uc640 4 \uc18d\uc131\uc740 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ub418\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc0f \ubbff\uc74c\uc758 \uc18d\uc131\uc740 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 $C(C\u03c6\rightarrow \u03c6)$\ub77c\ub294 \ub610 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc18d\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc18c\uc704 \uc774\ub3d9-\uc7ac\uadc0\uc131(\uc55e\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc131)\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4: KD4\uc5d0 \uc774 \uacf5\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud55c \uac83\uc774 KD45 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubbff\uc74c\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294\uac00? \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\uba74 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubbff\uc74c\uc758 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc778\uac00? \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2f5\uc774 '\uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4'\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4: \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ucd94\uac00 \uacf5\ub9ac\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub610\ud55c \uc774\ub294 \ud589\uc704\uc790\uc758 \uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubbff\uc74c\uc758 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ubbf8\ud574\uacb0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We show that the prevailing explanation, that fine-tuning updates should be orthogonal to safety-critical directions in high-dimensional parameter space, offers false reassurance: we show this orthogonality is structurally unstable and collapses under the dynamics of gradient descent. We then resolve this through a novel geometric analysis, proving that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, creating a brittle structure that first-order methods cannot detect or defend. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed avoid these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss generates second-order acceleration that systematically steers trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions. We formalize this mechanism through the Alignment Instability Condition, three geometric properties that, when jointly satisfied, lead to safety degradation. Our main result establishes a quartic scaling law: alignment loss grows with the fourth power of training time, governed by the sharpness of alignment geometry and the strength of curvature coupling between the fine-tuning task and safety-critical parameters. These results expose a structural blind spot in the current safety paradigm. The dominant approaches to safe fine-tuning address only the initial snapshot of a fundamentally dynamic problem. Alignment fragility is not a bug to be patched; it is an intrinsic geometric property of gradient descent on curved manifolds. Our results motivate the development of curvature-aware methods, and we hope will further enable a shift in alignment safety analysis from reactive red-teaming to predictive diagnostics for open-weight model deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uac8c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218

Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc870\ud569\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uace0\uc815\ud55c \ucc44\ub85c \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc53d\ud06c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, \uc790\uae30 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \uace0\uc815\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uac00 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc744 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE)\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \ucd94\ub860 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud568.

Existing approaches, such as belief state estimation and inter-agent communication, often fall short. Belief-based methods are limited by their focus on past experiences without fully leveraging global information, while communication methods often lack a robust model to effectively utilize the auxiliary information they provide. To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded.

Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac74\ubb3c \uc758\ubbf8\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc740 AECO \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c AI \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac74\ubb3c \uc758\ubbf8\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uad6c\ubd84\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac74\ubb3c \uc758\ubbf8\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc740 AECO \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 AI \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615 \uac04\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac74\ubb3c \uc758\ubbf8\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uad6c\ubd84\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 one-hot \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, llama-3 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc774 0.8766\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec AI\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uac74\ubb3c \uc758\ubbf8 \ud574\uc11d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac74\ubb3c \uc758\ubbf8\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \uac74\ucd95, \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1, \uac74\uc124 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 (AECO) \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 AI \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95(\uc608: one-hot)\uc740 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615 \uac04\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 AI\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac74\ubb3c \uc758\ubbf8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uad6c\ubd84\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc784\ubca0\ub529(\uc608: OpenAI GPT \ubc0f Meta LLaMA)\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 42\uac1c\uc758 \uac74\ubb3c \uac1d\uccb4 \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GraphSAGE \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 LLM \uc784\ubca0\ub529(1,536, 3,072 \ub610\ub294 4,096)\uacfc Matryoshka \ud45c\ud604 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c 1,024\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc555\ucd95 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc774 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc LLM \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 one-hot \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, llama-3(\uc555\ucd95) \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc774 0.8766\uc758 \uac00\uc911 \ud3c9\uade0 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c \ubc18\uba74, one-hot \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc740 0.8475\uc5d0 \uadf8\ucce4\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AI\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uac74\ubb3c \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.
