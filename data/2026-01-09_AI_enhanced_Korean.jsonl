However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who\" and ``what\" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "PC2P\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 MAPF \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ub3d9\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5ed \uad70\uc911 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 MAPF \ubc0f MARL \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "PC2P\ub294 Q-\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 MARL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ubd84\uc0b0 MAPF \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ub3d9\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5ed \uad70\uc911 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PC2P\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubd84\uc0b0 MAPF \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ubd84\ub9ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 PC2P\uc758 \uac01 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc785\uc99d\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c \ucc3e\uae30(MAPF)\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc774 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud611\ub825 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud611\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc778\uc2dd \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Q-\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 MARL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub798\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\uc0b0 MAPF \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 PC2P\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uac15\ud654 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc778 \uc120\ud0dd, \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c '\ub204\uac00'\uc640 '\ubb34\uc5c7\uc744' \ud30c\uc545\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uad70\uc911 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uc801 \uacf5\uac04 \uc81c\uc57d\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 \uc810\uc720 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ucc29 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc9c0\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc601\uc5ed \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uae30\ubc18 \uad50\ucc29 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud574\uc18c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 PC2P\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubd84\uc0b0 MAPF \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\ub9ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac01 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We define key architectural components, including agent orchestration, communication mechanisms, and control-flow strategies, and demonstrate how these enable rapid development of modular, domain-adaptive solutions. Three real-world case studies are tested in controlled, containerised pilots in telecommunications security, national heritage asset management, and utilities customer service automation. Initial empirical results show that, for these case studies, prototypes were delivered within two weeks and pilot-ready solutions within one month, suggesting reduced development overhead compared to conventional approaches and improved user accessibility. However, findings also reinforce limitations documented in the literature, including variability in LLM behaviour that leads to challenges in transitioning from prototype to production maturity.

However, traditional human-dependent chromatographic process development faces challenges such as reliance on expert experience, long development cycles, and labor intensity. ChromR, a large language model (LLM)-driven platform for chromatographic process design and optimization, is presented in this work. The platform integrates ChromLLM, a domain-specific LLM trained for chromatography, along with a multi-agent system and an automated chromatographic experimental device. The multi-agent system comprises four agents: domain knowledge answering, experimental design, experimental execution, and data analysis. ChromR enables automatic completion of the entire workflow-including initial process parameter recommendation, experimental design, automated execution, data analysis, and multi-objective optimization. By utilizing ChromR, dependency on expert knowledge is effectively reduced, while labor input and development time are significantly decreased. Chromatographic purification of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaf (EGBL) was selected as a case study.

While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc228\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc758 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub098 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucdb0\uc654\uc73c\ub098, \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \ubc29\uc2dd(\uba85\uc2dc\uc801, \uc81c\ud55c\uc801, \ubd80\uc7ac)\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\uaca9\uacfc \uc77c\ud68c\uc131 \ubc0f \ubc18\ubcf5 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc228\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uc2dc\uc810\uacfc \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9d3\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc228\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub098 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucdc4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ubc14\uac00 \uc801\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \uac04\uc811\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \ube44\uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc228\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc228\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801, \uc81c\ud55c\uc801 \ubc0f \ubd80\uc7ac\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\uaca9\uacfc \uc77c\ud68c\uc131 \ubc0f \ubc18\ubcf5 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec, \uc228\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uc2dc\uc810\uacfc \uadf8\uac83\uc774 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9d3\ub294\ub2e4."}}

However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called \"Red Queen\" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub4dc\ub514\uc5b4 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uccb4 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 Digital Red Queen (DRQ)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub354 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "DRQ\ub294 '\uc804\uc7c1'\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc11c\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ud22c\uae30\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "DRQ\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ud22c\uae30\ub4e4\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uace0, \ud589\ub3d9 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e4\uba70 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 Red Queen \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\uc774\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 LLM-\uc9c4\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc9c4\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub978\ubc14 '\ub808\ub4dc \ud038' \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc218\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 Digital Red Queen (DRQ)\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

From these attempts, we document six recurring failure modes: bias toward training data defaults, implementation drift under execution pressure, memory and context degradation across long-horizon tasks, overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures, insufficient domain intelligence, and weak scientific taste in experimental design.

Preprint", "summary": "Cybersecurity post-incident reviews are essential for identifying control failures and improving organisational resilience, yet they remain labour-intensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on expert judgment. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment post-incident review workflows by autonomously analysing system evidence and identifying security policy gaps. We present a threat-informed, agentic framework that ingests log data, maps observed behaviours to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and evaluates organisational security policies for adequacy and compliance. Using a simulated brute-force attack scenario against a Windows OpenSSH service (MITRE ATT&CK T1110), the system leverages GPT-4o for reasoning, LangGraph for multi-agent workflow orchestration, and LlamaIndex for traceable policy retrieval. Experimental results indicate that the LLM-based pipeline can interpret log-derived evidence, identify insufficient or missing policy controls, and generate actionable remediation recommendations with explicit evidence-to-policy traceability. Unlike prior work that treats log analysis and policy validation as isolated tasks, this study integrates both into a unified end-to-end proof-of-concept post-incident review framework. The findings suggest that LLM-assisted analysis has the potential to improve the efficiency, consistency, and auditability of post-incident evaluations, while highlighting the continued need for human oversight in high-stakes cybersecurity decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc0ac\uac74

In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad70\uc9d1 \uad00\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c

We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them.

Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel \"Reason-then-Summarize\" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis.

While content watermarking effectively attributes LLM-generated outputs, it fails to directly identify the high-level planning behaviors (e.g., tool and subgoal choices) that govern multi-step execution. Critically, watermarking at the planning-behavior layer faces unique challenges: minor distributional deviations in decision-making can compound during long-term agent operation, degrading utility, and many agents operate as black boxes that are difficult to intervene in directly. To bridge this gap, we propose AgentMark, a behavioral watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit identifiers into planning decisions while preserving utility. It operates by eliciting an explicit behavior distribution from the agent and applying distribution-preserving conditional sampling, enabling deployment under black-box APIs while remaining compatible with action-layer content watermarking. Experiments across embodied, tool-use, and social environments demonstrate practical multi-bit capacity, robust recovery from partial logs, and utility preservation.

Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer \"pain-belief\" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models.

However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping.

It further differentiates between hallucinations and jailbreaks in terms of intent and triggering mechanisms. We propose a three-dimensional survey framework: (1) Attack dimension-including template/encoding-based, in-context learning manipulation, reinforcement/adversarial learning, LLM-assisted and fine-tuned attacks, as well as prompt- and image-level perturbations and agent-based transfer in VLMs; (2) Defense dimension-encompassing prompt-level obfuscation, output evaluation, and model-level alignment or fine-tuning; and (3) Evaluation dimension-covering metrics such as Attack Success Rate (ASR), toxicity score, query/time cost, and multimodal Clean Accuracy and Attribute Success Rate. Compared with prior works, this survey spans the full spectrum from text-only to multimodal settings, consolidating shared mechanisms and proposing unified defense principles: variant-consistency and gradient-sensitivity detection at the perception layer, safety-aware decoding and output review at the generation layer, and adversarially augmented preference alignment at the parameter layer.

We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training.

In IEC61850 based smart substations, the Manufacturing Message Specification protocol operates over TCP to facilitate communication between SCADA systems and field devices such as Intelligent Electronic Devices and Programmable Logic Controllers. Although MMS enables efficient monitoring and control, it can be exploited by adversaries to generate legitimate looking packets for reconnaissance, unauthorized state reading, and malicious command injection, thereby disrupting grid operations. In this work, we propose a fully automated attack detection and prevention framework for IEC61850 compliant smart substations to counter remote cyberattacks that manipulate process states through compromised PLCs and IEDs. A detailed analysis of the MMS protocol is presented, and critical MMS field value pairs are extracted during both normal SCADA operation and active attack conditions. The proposed framework is validated using seven datasets comprising benign operational scenarios and multiple attack instances, including IEC61850Bean based attacks and script driven attacks leveraging the libiec61850 library. Our approach accurately identifies attack signature carrying MMS packets that attempt to disrupt circuit breaker status, specifically targeting the smart home zone IED and PLC of the EPIC testbed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in precisely detecting malicious MMS traffic and enhancing the cyber resilience of IEC61850 based smart grid environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 IEC61850 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ubcc0\uc804\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc\uac00 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc6b0\ud06c\ub77c\uc774\ub098 \uc804\ub825\ub9dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 IEC61850 \uc900\uc218 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ubcc0\uc804\uc18c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc190\uc0c1\ub41c PLC\uc640 IED\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uac70\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uc0c1 SCADA \uc6b4\uc601 \ubc0f \uacf5\uaca9 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c MMS \ud544\ub4dc \uac12 \uc30d\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 MMS \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 MMS \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 IEC61850 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc\ub294 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub178\ucd9c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc6b0\ud06c\ub77c\uc774\ub098 \uc804\ub825\ub9dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \\textbf{STAR-S} (\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{TA}ught \\textbf{R}easoning based on \\textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines.

We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \\cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294

In an effort to complement the ingrained \"knowledge\" of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have become widely popular. At its core, RAG involves the coupling of LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases, whereby the generation of a response to a user question is augmented with contextual and up-to-date information. The proliferation of RAG has sparked concerns about data privacy, particularly with the inherent risks that arise when leveraging databases with potentially sensitive information. Numerous recent works have explored various aspects of privacy risks in RAG systems, from adversarial attacks to proposed mitigations. With the goal of surveying and unifying these works, we ask one simple question: What are the privacy risks in RAG, and how can they be measured and mitigated? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic literature review of RAG works addressing privacy, and we systematize our findings into a comprehensive set of privacy risks, mitigation techniques, and evaluation strategies. We supplement these findings with two primary artifacts: a Taxonomy of RAG Privacy Risks and a RAG Privacy Process Diagram. Our work contributes to the study of privacy in RAG not only by conducting the first systematization of risks and mitigations, but also by uncovering important considerations when mitigating privacy risks in RAG systems and assessing the current maturity of proposed mitigations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uce21\uc815 \ubc0f \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec \uc99d\uac00\ub85c RAG \uae30\ubc95\uc774 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc704\ud5d8 \ubc0f \uc644\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc885\ud569\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RAG \uac1c\uc778 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc704\ud5d8 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ubc0f \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc704\ud5d8 \uc644\ud654 \uc2dc \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub97c uncover \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RAG\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc704\ud5d8\uacfc \uc644\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ub300\ub294 LLM \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.\n  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.\n  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCRIBE\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \uc218\uc900 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc800\uc218\uc900 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc30\ubd84\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "SCRIBE\ub294 \uae30\uc220 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc758 \uc120\ubcc4\ub41c \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \ud558\uc704 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud574\ub2f9 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc5d0 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc138\ubd80 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "SCRIBE\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 Qwen3-4B \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 AIME25 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 43.3%\uc5d0\uc11c 63.3%\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SCRIBE\ub294 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacfc\uc815 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud310\ubcc4\uc790\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc885\uc885 \uc2dc\ub044\ub7fd\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SCRIBE (\uc911\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uae30\uc220 \uc870\uac74\ud654 \ubcf4\uc0c1)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc911\uac04 \uc218\uc900 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability.

However, existing reactive defense approaches struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving multi-turn jailbreaks, where attackers continuously deepen their attacks to exploit vulnerabilities. To address this critical challenge, we propose HoneyTrap, a novel deceptive LLM defense framework leveraging collaborative defenders to counter jailbreak attacks. It integrates four defensive agents, Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, and System Harmonizer, each performing a specialized security role and collaborating to complete a deceptive defense. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce MTJ-Pro, a challenging multi-turn progressive jailbreak dataset that combines seven advanced jailbreak strategies designed to gradually deepen attack strategies across multi-turn attacks. Besides, we present two novel metrics: Mislead Success Rate (MSR) and Attack Resource Consumption (ARC), which provide more nuanced assessments of deceptive defense beyond conventional measures. Experimental results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMa-3.1 demonstrate that HoneyTrap achieves an average reduction of 68.77% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, even in a dedicated adaptive attacker setting with intensified conditions, HoneyTrap remains resilient, leveraging deceptive engagement to prolong interactions, significantly increasing the time and computational costs required for successful exploitation. Unlike simple rejection, HoneyTrap strategically wastes attacker resources without impacting benign queries, improving MSR and ARC by 118.11% and 149.16%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "HoneyTrap\uc740 \ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud611\uc5c5 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "HoneyTrap\uc740 Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, System Harmonizer\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uc804\ubb38 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ub9cc\uc801 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc644\uc218\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HoneyTrap\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uade0 68.77%\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc798 \uacac\ub514\ub294 \ubaa8\uc2b5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HoneyTrap\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc758 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0ad\ube44\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc815\uc0c1 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\ub9cc\uc801 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc18\uc751\uc801 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc545\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2ec\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud0c8\uc625\uc5d0 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ub300\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud611\uc5c5 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ub9cc\uc801 LLM \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 HoneyTrap\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, our study shows that directly transferring such text-based reasoning paradigms to protein function understanding is ineffective: reinforcement learning mainly amplifies superficial keyword patterns while failing to introduce new biological knowledge, resulting in limited generalization. We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation.

Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21 \uad6d\uc18c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc870\uc808 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc774 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud568.", "method": "Exploratory-Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uad6d\uc18c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc870\uc808.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c, ECGR\uc774 \uad6d\uc18c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad6d\uc18c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc804\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc774 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub3d9\uc548 \uad6d\uc18c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc65c\uace1\ud558\uc5ec FL\uc744 \uc8fc\ub85c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uac04\uc5d0 \ub204\uc801\ub418\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad00\ucc30\uc740 \uad6d\uc18c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uac00 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 FL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc870\uc808 \uc9c0\ub81b\ub300\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \uc5c6\uc774 \uad6d\uc18c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad70\uc9d1 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc798 \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \uc798\ubabb \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 Exploratory-Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc LC25000 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uad6d\uc18c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems.

Existing methods struggle with datasets exhibiting varying local densities: distance-based methods miss local anomalies, while density-based approaches require careful parameter selection and incur quadratic time complexity. We observe that local anomalies, though indistinguishable under global analysis, become conspicuous when the data space is decomposed into restricted regions and each region is examined independently. Leveraging this geometric insight, we propose SVEAD (Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles Anomaly Detector), which constructs ensemble random Voronoi diagrams and scores points by normalized cell-relative distances weighted by local scale. The proposed method achieves linear time complexity and constant space complexity.

An Entropy-based Safety Reminder for LRMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc548\uc804 \ub9ac\ub9c8\uc778\ub354 \ubb38\uad6c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub428.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRM)\uc758 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc99d\ud3ed\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud568.", "method": "SafeRemind\ub77c\ub294 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc548\uc804 \ub9ac\ub9c8\uc778\ub354 \ubb38\uad6c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc785\ud568.", "result": "SafeRemind\ub294 \uacb0\uc815 \uc7a0\uae08 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\ud574\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc804\ud658\uc2dc\ucf1c 5\uac1c\uc758 LRM\uacfc 6\uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 45.5%p \uac1c\uc120\ud568.", "conclusion": "SafeRemind\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud575\uc2ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c LRM\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRM)\uc740 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc99d\ud3ed\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 LRM\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804 \ub9ac\ub9c8\uc778\ub354 \ubb38\uad6c\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc774 LRM \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \ucc29\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc548\uc804 \ub9ac\ub9c8\uc778\ub354 \ubb38\uad6c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\ub294 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 SafeRemind\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uc815 \uc7a0\uae08 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec SafeRemind\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud574\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc804\ud658\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 5\uac1c\uc758 LRM\uacfc 6\uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 SafeRemind\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 Core reasoning utility\ub294 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c 45.5%p\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction.

Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process.

Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator.

Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc138\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\ub294 \ub17c\ubb38.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e8\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud604\uc7ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc138\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud568.", "result": "\uc77c\ubd80 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac70\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70(1% \ubbf8\ub9cc), \uc608\uce21\ub41c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc798\ubabb \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uace0 (\uc57d 15%), \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc81c\uacf5\ub420 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \uc800\ud558\ub428(\ucd5c\ub300 5%)\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \uc870\uc728\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc778\uc9c0\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac08 \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc90c.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e8\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc608\uc0c1\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc678\ubd80 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubd80 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac70\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70(1% \ubbf8\ub9cc), \uc608\uce21\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc798\ubabb \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uace0(\uc57d 15%), \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc81c\uacf5\ub420 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(\ucd5c\ub300 5%). \uadc0\uc18d \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5b8\uc81c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc608\uce21 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ub825\uc744 \ud558\ub958 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uac00 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc784\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \uc870\uc728\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ubbf8\ub798 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc801 \uc778\uc9c0\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\ub294 \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences.

However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%.

However, the limited availability of radar sleep data poses challenges in building robust models that generalize across diverse cohorts and environments. This study proposes a novel deep transfer learning framework to enhance sleep stage classification using radar data. Methods: An end-to-end neural network was developed to classify sleep stages based on nocturnal respiratory and motion signals. The network was trained using a combination of large-scale polysomnography (PSG) datasets and radar data. A domain adaptation approach employing adversarial learning was utilized to bridge the knowledge gap between PSG and radar signals. Validation was performed on a radar dataset of 47 older adults (mean age: 71.2), including 18 participants with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Results: The proposed network structure achieves an accuracy of 79.5% with a Kappa value of 0.65 when classifying wakefulness, rapid eye movement, light sleep and deep sleep. Experimental results confirm that our deep transfer learning approach significantly enhances automatic sleep staging performance in the target domain. Conclusion: This method effectively addresses challenges associated with data variability and limited sample size, substantially improving the reliability of automatic sleep staging models, especially in contexts where radar data is limited. Significance: The findings underscore the viability of UWB radar as a nonintrusive, forward-looking sleep assessment tool that could significantly benefit care for older people and people with neurodegenerative disorders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub808\uc774\ub354 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub0b4\ubd80 \uc218\uba74 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uce68\uc2b5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub808\uc774\ub354 \uc218\uba74 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc57c\uac04 \ud638\ud761 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc791 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc218\uba74 \ub2e4\uc6d0 \uac80\uc0ac(PSG) \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \ub808\uc774\ub354 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uac01\uc131, REM \uc218\uba74, \uc595\uc740 \uc218\uba74 \ubc0f \uae4a\uc740 \uc218\uba74\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud560 \ub54c 79.5%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 0.65\uc758 \uce74\ud30c \uac12\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc2ec\uce35 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9 \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa9\uc801: \ucd08\uad11\ub300\uc5ed \ub808\uc774\ub354 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ube44\uce68\uc2b5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud648 \uc218\uba74 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub808\uc774\ub354 \uc218\uba74 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uacfc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub808\uc774\ub354 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc29\ubc95: \uc57c\uac04 \ud638\ud761 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc791 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc6d0 \uac80\uc0ac(PSG) \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \ub808\uc774\ub354 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Building centralized datasets to capture this diversity is often infeasible due to privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions. We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical and privacy-preserving approach for developing equitable, scalable, and generalizable medical imaging AI in resource-limited healthcare environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \ud608\uc561 \ud615\ud0dc \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uc5c6\uc774 \uae30\uad00\uac04 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 AI \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub0ae\uc740 \ubc0f \uc911\uc704 \uc18c\ub4dd \uad6d\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ud608\uc561 \ud615\ud0dc \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ud608\uc561\ud559 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uba70 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc784\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \ud608\uc561 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc5f0\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc601\uc5ed \ubd88\ubcc0\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uba70 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uad50\ucc28 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uae30\uad00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 AI \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud608\uc561 \ud615\ud0dc \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ub0ae\uc740 \ubc0f \uc911\uc704 \uc18c\ub4dd \uad6d\uac00(LMIC)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud608\uc561\ud559\uc801 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub098 \uc5fc\uc0c9 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131, \uc601\uc0c1 \ucc28\uc774 \ubc0f \ud76c\uadc0 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uaddc\uc815\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad50\ud658 \uc5c6\uc774 \uae30\uad00 \uac04 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubc31\ud608\uad6c \ud615\ud0dc \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc784\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \ud608\uc561 \ud544\ub984\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc601\uc5ed \ubd88\ubcc0\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \ubc0f \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc5f0\ud569 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uad50\ucc28 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uae30\uad00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 AI \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).\n  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.\n  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability

Despite its importance, verification in software engineering (SWE) agent settings often relies on code execution, which can be difficult to scale due to environment setup overhead. Scalable alternatives such as patch classifiers and heuristic methods exist, but they are less grounded in codebase context and harder to interpret. To this end, we explore Agentic Rubrics: an expert agent interacts with the repository to create a context-grounded rubric checklist, and candidate patches are then scored against it without requiring test execution. On SWE-Bench Verified under parallel TTS evaluation, Agentic Rubrics achieve a score of 54.2% on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and 40.6% on Qwen3-32B, with at least a +3.5 percentage-point gain over the strongest baseline in our comparison set. We further analyze rubric behavior, showing that rubric scores are consistent with ground-truth tests while also flagging issues that tests do not capture. Our ablations show that agentic context gathering is essential for producing codebase-specific, unambiguous criteria. Together, these results suggest that Agentic Rubrics provide an efficient, scalable, and granular verification signal for SWE agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Agentic Rubrics\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uac80\uc99d \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ud658\uacbd \uc124\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Agentic Rubrics\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub808\ud3ec\uc9c0\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uba70 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uccb4\ud06c\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud328\uce58\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Agentic Rubrics\ub294 SWE-Bench\uc758 Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B\uc5d0\uc11c 54.2%, Qwen3-32B\uc5d0\uc11c 40.6%\uc758 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5b4 \ube44\uad50 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\uc18c +3.5%\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Agentic Rubrics\uac00 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac80\uc99d \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc99d\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1(SWE) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac80\uc99d\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \ud658\uacbd \uc124\uc815 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud328\uce58 \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \ubc0f \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ub35c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub808\ud3ec\uc9c0\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9e5\ub77d \uae30\ubc18 \uccb4\ud06c\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud328\uce58\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 Agentic Rubrics\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
