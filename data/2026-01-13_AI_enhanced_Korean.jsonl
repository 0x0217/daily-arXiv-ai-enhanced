By integrating memory, tool use, and iterative decision cycles, these systems enable continuous, autonomous workflows in real-world environments. This survey examines the implications of agentic AI for cybersecurity. On the defensive side, agentic capabilities enable continuous monitoring, autonomous incident response, adaptive threat hunting, and fraud detection at scale. Conversely, the same properties amplify adversarial power by accelerating reconnaissance, exploitation, coordination, and social-engineering attacks. These dual-use dynamics expose fundamental gaps in existing governance, assurance, and accountability mechanisms, which were largely designed for non-autonomous and short-lived AI systems. To address these challenges, we survey emerging threat models, security frameworks, and evaluation pipelines tailored to agentic systems, and analyze systemic risks including agent collusion, cascading failures, oversight evasion, and memory poisoning. Finally, we present three representative use-case implementations that illustrate how agentic AI behaves in practical cybersecurity workflows, and how design choices shape reliability, safety, and operational effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Agentic AI\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0, \uacc4\ud68d, \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Agentic AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\uc2dc AI\uc758 \uc774\uc911 \uc6a9\ub3c4 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378, \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacf5\ubaa8, \uc5f0\uc1c4 \uc2e4\ud328, \uac10\ub3c5 \ud68c\ud53c \ubc0f \uae30\uc5b5 \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\uc2dc AI\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0, \uacc4\ud68d, \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc911\uc694 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc5b5, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc870\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubd05\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc29\uc5b4 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1, \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uac74 \ub300\uc751, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, \uac19\uc740 \uc18d\uc131\uc774 \uc815\ucc30, \ucc29\ucde8, \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uc18c\uc15c \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud798\uc744 \uc99d\ub300\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5ed\ud559\uc740 \ube44\uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e8\uae30\uc801\uc778 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uae30\uc874 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4, \ubcf4\uc99d \ubc0f \ucc45\uc784 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud2c8\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378, \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacf5\ubaa8, \uc5f0\uc1c4 \uc2e4\ud328, \uac10\ub3c5 \ud68c\ud53c \ubc0f \uae30\uc5b5 \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recent work demonstrated that the MINJA (Memory Injection Attack) achieves over 95 % injection success rate and 70 % attack success rate under idealized conditions. However, the robustness of these attacks in realistic deployments and effective defensive mechanisms remain understudied. This work addresses these gaps through systematic empirical evaluation of memory poisoning attacks and defenses in Electronic Health Record (EHR) agents. We investigate attack robustness by varying three critical dimensions: initial memory state, number of indication prompts, and retrieval parameters. Our experiments on GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct models using MIMIC-III clinical data reveal that realistic conditions with pre-existing legitimate memories dramatically reduce attack effectiveness. We then propose and evaluate two novel defense mechanisms: (1) Input/Output Moderation using composite trust scoring across multiple orthogonal signals, and (2) Memory Sanitization with trust-aware retrieval employing temporal decay and pattern-based filtering. Our defense evaluation reveals that effective memory sanitization requires careful trust threshold calibration to prevent both overly conservative rejection (blocking all entries) and insufficient filtering (missing subtle attacks), establishing important baselines for future adaptive defense mechanisms.

In this work, we take an exploratory step toward privacy-preserving continual pretraining by proposing an entity-based framework that synthesizes encrypted training data to protect personally identifiable information (PII). Our approach constructs a weighted entity graph to guide data synthesis and applies deterministic encryption to PII entities, enabling LLMs to encode new knowledge through continual pretraining while granting authorized access to sensitive data through decryption keys. Our results on limited-scale datasets demonstrate that our pretrained models outperform base models and ensure PII security, while exhibiting a modest performance gap compared to models trained on unencrypted synthetic data. We further show that increasing the number of entities and leveraging graph-based synthesis improves model performance, and that encrypted models retain instruction-following capabilities with long retrieved contexts. We discuss the security implications and limitations of deterministic encryption, positioning this work as an initial investigation into the design space of encrypted data pretraining for privacy-preserving LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/DataArcTech/SoE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8

Existing defenses encounter a critical dilemma as advanced models prioritize injected rules due to strict alignment while static protection mechanisms sever the feedback loop required for adaptive reasoning. To reconcile this conflict, we propose \\textbf{VIGIL}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from restrictive isolation to a verify-before-commit protocol. By facilitating speculative hypothesis generation and enforcing safety through intent-grounded verification, \\textbf{VIGIL} preserves reasoning flexibility while ensuring robust control. We further introduce \\textbf{SIREN}, a benchmark comprising 959 tool stream injection cases designed to simulate pervasive threats characterized by dynamic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\textbf{VIGIL} outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic defenses by reducing the attack success rate by over 22\\% while more than doubling the utility under attack compared to static baselines, thereby achieving an optimal balance between security and utility.

However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline.

Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "NAIAD\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc678\ubd80 \ubd84\uc11d \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ub959 \uc218\uc5ed \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub0b4\ub959 \uc218\uc5ed \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \uac74\uac15\uacfc \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uae30\uc801\uc808\ud55c \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "NAIAD\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c8\uc758\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, RAG, LLM \ucd94\ub860, \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc870\uc815, \uacc4\uc0b0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc801\ud569\uc131 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc804\ubb38\uc131 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \uc804\uc6a9 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 77%\uc640 85% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd08\uae30 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c8\uc758 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac15\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, LLM \ubc31\ubcf8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc808\uc81c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 Gemma 3(27B)\uc640 Qwen 2.5(14B)\uac00 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub0b4\ub959 \uc218\uc5ed \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \uac74\uac15\uacfc \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uae30\uc801\uc808\ud55c \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub0a8\uc138\uade0, \uc5fd\ub85d\uc18c \ub610\ub294 \uae30\ud0c0 \uc218\uc9c8 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \ud558\uc704 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubcc4\ub3c4\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.

However, current LLM-based systems typically generate narratives and visualizations in staged pipelines, following either a text-first-graph-second or a graph-first-text-second paradigm. These designs often lead to chart-text inconsistency and insight freezing, where the intermediate evidence space becomes fixed and the model can no longer retrieve or construct new visual evidence as the narrative evolves, resulting in shallow and predefined analysis. To address the limitations, we propose \\textbf{EvidFuse}, a training-free multi-agent framework that enables writing-time text-chart interleaved generation for data-driven reports. EvidFuse decouples visualization analysis from long-form drafting via two collaborating components: a \\textbf{Data-Augmented Analysis Agent}, equipped with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)-derived knowledge and access to raw tables, and a \\textbf{Real-Time Evidence Construction Writer} that plans an outline and drafts the report while intermittently issuing fine-grained analysis requests. This design allows visual evidence to be constructed and incorporated exactly when the narrative requires it, directly constraining subsequent claims and enabling on-demand expansion of the evidence space.

To build cybersecurity superintelligence --Cybersecurity AI exceeding best human capability-such strategic intuition must be embedded into agentic reasoning processes. We present Generative Cut-the-Rope (G-CTR), a game-theoretic guidance layer that extracts attack graphs from agent's context, computes Nash equilibria with effort-aware scoring, and feeds a concise digest back into the LLM loop \\emph{guiding} the agent's actions. Across five real-world exercises, G-CTR matches 70--90% of expert graph structure while running 60--245x faster and over 140x cheaper than manual analysis. In a 44-run cyber-range, adding the digest lifts success from 20.0% to 42.9%, cuts cost-per-success by 2.7x, and reduces behavioral variance by 5.2x. In Attack-and-Defense exercises, a shared digest produces the Purple agent, winning roughly 2:1 over the LLM-only baseline and 3.7:1 over independently guided teams. This closed-loop guidance is what produces the breakthrough: it reduces ambiguity, collapses the LLM's search space, suppresses hallucinations, and keeps the model anchored to the most relevant parts of the problem, yielding large gains in success rate, consistency, and reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\ub2f9 \uc218\ucc9c \uac00\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacbd\uc7c1 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc9c1\uad00\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 G-CTR\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc9c1\uad00 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0.", "method": "G-CTR\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ub0b4\uc26c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uba70, LLM \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac00\uc774\ub358\uc2a4 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "G-CTR\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 70~90% \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uba70, \uc218\ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d\ubcf4\ub2e4 60~245\ubc30 \ube60\ub974\uace0 140\ubc30 \uc800\ub834\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "G-CTR\uc758 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uac00\uc774\ub358\uc2a4\ub294 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0, LLM\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucd95\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc131\uacf5\ub960, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\ub2f9 \uc218\ucc9c \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc9c1\uad00\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc288\ud37c \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc804\uc2a4 - \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 AI\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc9c1\uad00\uc774 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ub178\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd \uc810\uc218\ub85c \ub0b4\uc26c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 '\uc720\ub3c4'\ud558\ub294 \uac04\uacb0\ud55c \uc694\uc57d\uc744 LLM \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc778 Generative Cut-the-Rope (G-CTR)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c G-CTR\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 70~90%\ub97c \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \uc218\ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d\ubcf4\ub2e4 60~245\ubc30 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uace0 140\ubc30 \ub354 \uc800\ub834\ud558\uac8c \uc6b4\uc601\ub41c\ub2e4. 44\ud68c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc5f0\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc694\uc57d\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uba74 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 20.0%\uc5d0\uc11c 42.9%\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc131\uacf5 \uac74\ub2f9 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 2.7\ubc30 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uba70, \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 5.2\ubc30 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc5f0\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc720 \uc694\uc57d\uc740 \ud37c\ud50c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, LLM \uc804\uc6a9 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub300\ub7b5 2:1, \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \ubc1b\uc740 \ud300\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 3.7:1\ub85c \uc2b9\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uac00\uc774\ub358\uc2a4\uac00 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\ub0b8\ub2e4: \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0, LLM\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucd95\uc18c\ud558\uba70, \ud658\uac01\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uace0, \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uace0\uc815\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc131\uacf5\ub960, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc758 \ud070 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc628\ub2e4."}}

Specifically, there are (1) challenges in synthesizing high-performing teaching policies in complex domains, (2) difficulties when teachers must reason in out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and (3) mismatches between the decentralized students' and the centralized teacher's observation spaces. To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation. HINT also applies performance-based filtering to retain only outcome-relevant guidance, reducing observation mismatches. We evaluate HINT on challenging cooperative domains (e.g., FireCommander for resource allocation, MARINE for tactical combat). Across these benchmarks, HINT outperforms baselines, achieving improvements of 60% to 165% in success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "HINT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 KD \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\ud615 \uad50\uc721\uc73c\ub85c \ub514\uc13c\ud2b8\ub7f4\ub77c\uc774\uc988\ub4dc \ud559\uc0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 MARL\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "KD\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 MARL\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub098 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad50\uc218 \uc815\ucc45 \ud569\uc131, OOD \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860, \uad00\ucc30 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "HINT\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 RL\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uad50\uc0ac \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc758\uc0ac \ube44\uc815\ucc45 RL\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad50\uc0ac\uc640 \ud559\uc0dd \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HINT\ub294 FireCommander \ubc0f MARINE\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 60%\uc5d0\uc11c 165% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HINT\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\ud615 \uad50\uc721\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c MARL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 KD \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc131\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\ucc30 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958(KD)\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ud559\uc0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\ud615 \uad50\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MARL\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 (1) \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uad50\uc721 \uc815\ucc45 \ud569\uc131\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804, (2) \uad50\uc0ac\uac00 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubd84\ud3ec(OOD) \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0, (3) \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc0dd\uacfc \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\ud615 \uad50\uc0ac\uc758 \uad00\ucc30 \uacf5\uac04 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911 \uad50\uc721, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c MARL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 KD \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 HINT(\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc804\uc774)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacc4\uce35\uc801 RL\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec HINT\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uad50\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac \ube44\uc815\ucc45 RL\uc740 \uad50\uc0ac \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uad50\uc0ac\uc640 \ud559\uc0dd \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec OOD \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.

Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation.

We show that in shared-policy Deep Q-Network learning, standard exploration can induce a robust and systematic collapse of cooperation even in environments where fully cooperative equilibria are stable and payoff dominant. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that shared DQN converges to stable but persistently low-cooperation regimes. This collapse is not caused by reward misalignment, noise, or insufficient training, but by a representational failure arising from partial observability combined with parameter coupling across heterogeneous agent states. Exploration-driven updates bias the shared representation toward locally dominant defection responses, which then propagate across agents and suppress cooperative learning. We confirm that the failure persists across network sizes, exploration schedules, and payoff structures, and disappears when parameter sharing is removed or when agents maintain independent representations. These results identify a fundamental failure mode of shared-policy MARL and establish structural conditions under which scalable learning architectures can systematically undermine cooperation. Our findings provide concrete guidance for the design of multi-agent learning systems in social and economic environments where collective behavior is critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacf5\uc720 \uc815\ucc45 \ub525 Q-\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd95\uad34\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c.", "motivation": "\ub3d9\uc801 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uc758\uc874.", "method": "\uacf5\uc720\ub41c DQN\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0ae\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc2e4\uc2dc.", "result": "\uae30\ub300 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58, \ub178\uc774\uc988, \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \ud611\ub825 \ubd95\uad34\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd.", "conclusion": "\uacf5\uc720 \uc815\ucc45 MARL\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubc0f \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud560 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3d9\uc801 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uacf5\uc720\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uae4a\uc740 Q-\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uade0\ud615\uc774 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc6b0\uc6d4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd95\uad34\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \uacf5\uc720\ub41c DQN\uc774 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0ae\uc740 \ud611\ub825 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd95\uad34\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58, \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub610\ub294 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uacb0\ud569\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \uc2e4\ud328\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uad6d\uc18c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\ubc18 \ubc18\uc751\uc73c\ub85c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc804\ud30c\ub418\uc5b4 \ud611\ub825 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud06c\uae30, \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc77c\uc815 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub428\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0, \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uacf5\uc720\uac00 \uc81c\uac70\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \ub54c \uc0ac\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \uc815\ucc45 MARL\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc640 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c \ubc0f \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Focusing on the scientist subset, I show that widely available LLMs with web search and agentic capabilities can link six out of twenty-four interviews to specific scientific works, recovering associated authors and, in some cases, uniquely identifying the interviewees. My contribution is to show that modern LLM-based agents make such re-identification attacks easy and low-effort: off-the-shelf tools can, with a few natural-language prompts, search the web, cross-reference details, and propose likely matches, effectively lowering the technical barrier.

Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections.

This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary.

A fundamental yet underexplored mechanism in this process is conformity, the tendency of agents to align their judgments with prevailing group opinions. This paper presents a systematic study of how network topology shapes conformity dynamics in LLM-based MAS through a misinformation detection task. We introduce a confidence-normalized pooling rule that controls the trade-off between self-reliance and social influence, enabling comparisons between two canonical decision paradigms: Centralized Aggregation and Distributed Consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that network topology critically governs both the efficiency and robustness of collective judgments. Centralized structures enable immediate decisions but are sensitive to hub competence and exhibit same-model alignment biases. In contrast, distributed structures promote more robust consensus, while increased network connectivity speeds up convergence but also heightens the risk of wrong-but-sure cascades, in which agents converge on incorrect decisions with high confidence. These findings characterize the conformity dynamics in LLM-based MAS, clarifying how network topology and self-social weighting jointly shape the efficiency, robustness, and failure modes of collective decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8

However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.\n  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ALVGL not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly improves optimization efficiency, making it a reliable and effective solution for differentiable causal discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucc28\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95 ALVGL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "ALVGL\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c \ubc0f \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc815\ubc00 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 ADMM \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ALVGL\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ALVGL\uc740 \ucc28\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ucc28\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub610\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ud63c\ub780 \ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uae30\uc131\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc758 \ube44\uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc131\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc288\ud37c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uae09\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc288\ud37c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucc28\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 ALVGL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\\textbf{Hi}erarchical \\textbf{Z}eroth- and \\textbf{F}irst-\\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones. Notably, ZO in Hi-ZFO is not merely a memory-saving surrogate; it is intentionally introduced as a source of \"beneficial stochasticity\" to help the model escape the local minima where pure FO optimization tends to stagnate. Validated across diverse generative, mathematical, and code reasoning tasks, Hi-ZFO consistently achieves superior performance while significantly reducing the training time. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical hybrid optimization for LLM fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hi-ZFO\ub294 LLM\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 1\ucc28 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uc0e4\ud504\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uba70, 0\ucc28 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub290\ub9b0 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "method": "Hi-ZFO\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\ubcc4 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uace0, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uce35\uc5d0\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c 1\ucc28 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ub35c \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uce35\uc5d0\ub294 0\ucc28 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Hi-ZFO\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131, \uc218\ud559, \ucf54\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 LLM \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud45c\uc900 1\ucc28 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ub0a0\uce74\ub86d\uace0 \ubd88\ub7c9\ud55c \ucd5c\uc19f\uac12\uc73c\ub85c \uce58\uc6b0\uce58\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, 0\ucc28 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub290\ub9b0 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac83\uc740, \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825 \ubc0f \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \ucd94\uc815 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf1c 0\ucc28 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc18c\uc74c\uc774 \ub9ce\uace0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 0\ucc28 \ubc0f 1\ucc28 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Hi-ZFO(\ud558\uc774\ub808\ub974\ud0a4\uceec \uc81c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ubc0f \ud37c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc624\ub354 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Recent research employs reinforcement learning (RL) to end-to-end optimize the retrieval-augmented reasoning process, directly enhancing its capacity to resolve complex queries. However, reliable deployment is hindered by two obstacles. 1) Retrieval Collapse: iterative retrieval over large corpora fails to locate intermediate evidence containing bridge answers without reasoning-guided planning, causing downstream reasoning to collapse. 2) Learning Instability: end-to-end trajectory training suffers from weak credit assignment across reasoning chains and poor error localization across modules, causing overfitting to benchmark-specific heuristics that limit transferability and stability. To address these problems, we propose PRISMA, a decoupled RL-guided framework featuring a Plan-Retrieve-Inspect-Solve-Memoize architecture. PRISMA's strength lies in reasoning-guided collaboration: the Inspector provides reasoning-based feedback to refine the Planner's decomposition and fine-grained retrieval, while enforcing evidence-grounded reasoning in the Solver. We optimize individual agent capabilities via Two-Stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Stage I calibrates the Planner and Solver as specialized experts in planning and reasoning, while Stage II utilizes Observation-Aware Residual Policy Optimization (OARPO) to enhance the Inspector's ability to verify context and trigger targeted recovery.

However, an ideal CL agent should not only be able to overcome CF, but also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT), i.e., using the learned knowledge from previous tasks for the new task learning (namely FKT), and improving the previous tasks' performance with the knowledge of the new task (namely BKT). To this end, this paper first models CL as an optimization problem in which each sequential learning task aims to achieve its optimal performance under the constraint that both FKT and BKT should be positive. It then proposes a novel Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) method, which achieves forgetting-free and positive KT. Furthermore, the bounds that can lead to negative FKT and BKT are estimated theoretically. Based on the bounds, a new strategy for online task similarity detection is also proposed to facilitate positive KT. To overcome CF, ETCL learns a set of task-specific binary masks to isolate a sparse sub-network for each task while preserving the performance of a dense network for the task. At the beginning of a new task learning, ETCL tries to align the new task's gradient with that of the sub-network of the previous most similar task to ensure positive FKT. By using a new bi-objective optimization strategy and an orthogonal gradient projection method, ETCL updates only the weights of previous similar tasks at the classification layer to achieve positive BKT. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc5b5 \uc18c\uc2e4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\uc774\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 ETCL \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc18c\uc2e4\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud568\uacfc \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\uc774\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CL\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, ETCL \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc18c\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\uc774\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc ETCL\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ETCL\uc740 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c, \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c \ubc0f \ud63c\ud569 \uacfc\uc81c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5(C3) \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\uc18c\uc131\uacfc \uc774\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc18c\uc2e4(CF)\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 C3 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 CF\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ubc29 \ubc0f \ud6c4\ubc29 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\uc774(KT)\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\uc6b4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83(\uc804\ubc29 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\uc774, FKT)\uacfc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83(\ud6c4\ubc29 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\uc774, BKT)\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub25c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uba3c\uc800 \uac01 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 FKT\uc640 BKT\uac00 \ubaa8\ub450 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc774\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c C3\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc78a\ud600\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 KT\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5(ETCL) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 FKT \ubc0f BKT\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 KT\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uacfc\uc81c \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uac10\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\ub7b5\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c\ub2e4.

Case studies include: a shift toward small, community-focused parks in New York, reflecting local green space efforts; the spread of concentrated water pollution across districts in Hong Kong, pointing to coordinated water management; and a notable decline in open dumpsites in Shenzhen, with contrasting links between nighttime economic activity and waste types, indicating differing urban pressures behind domestic and construction waste.

While robust for general-purpose assistants, this one-size-fits-all ethical framework imposes a \"transparency tax\" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding, such as public relations, negotiation, and crisis management. To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises. Spanning 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries, Crisis-Bench tasks an LLM-based Public Relations (PR) Agent with navigating a dynamic 7-day corporate crisis simulation while managing strictly separated Private and Public narrative states to enforce rigorous information asymmetry. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price. Crisis-Bench provides the first quantitative framework for assessing \"Reputation Management\" capabilities, arguing for a shift from rigid moral absolutism to context-aware professional alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba74\uc11c, \uc704\uae30 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ubb38 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ubcf4 \ube44\uacf5\uac1c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \ub298\uc5b4\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc778\uac04-\ubaa8\ub378 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ub300\ud654 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ucca0\uc800\ud568\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\uba70, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc774 \uc774\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf4\ud3b8\ud654\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ub300\ub450\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc81c\uacf5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud655\uc0b0\ub428\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4: \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud560\uae4c? \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2f5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04-\ubaa8\ub378 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub300\ud654 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud560\ub9cc\ud55c \uc810\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc758 \ud568\uc218\ub85c\uc11c \ucd94\uc815 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4: \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec\ubb34\uad00(probably-approximately correct) \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\uc131 \uc678\uc5d0\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uac00\uc815\ub3c4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(\uc989, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub180\ub78d\ub3c4\ub85d \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0\uc11c \uba3c\uc800 \uadf8 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \uc804\ud658\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task.

A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework.

However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \\textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training.

Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub514\ubca0\uc774\ud2b8(DynaDebate)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc758 \ud1a0\ub860 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub17c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc624\ub958\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DynaDebate\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998(\ub3d9\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ud560\ub2f9, \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc911\uc2ec \ud1a0\ub860, \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uac80\uc99d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "DynaDebate\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 MAD \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud1a0\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \ud0c1\uc6d4\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc774 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \uad50\ud658 \ubc0f \ub17c\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 MAS\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860(MAD) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ube44\uc720\ub3c4 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ubc1b\uc544\ub4e4\uc774\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub294 \uac19\uc740 \uc624\ub958\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub17c\uc758\uac00 \ubc29\ud574\ubc1b\uace0 \ucd5c\uc885 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ub2e4\uc218\uacb0 \ud22c\ud45c\ub85c \ucd95\uc18c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860(DynaDebate)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "StackPlanner\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud611\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uad8c\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uad00\ub9ac \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud611\uc5c5 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac16\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "StackPlanner\ub294 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\uc5b5\uacfc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud611\ub3d9 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uae4a\uc740 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uae30 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 StackPlanner\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud611\uc5c5 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud611\uc5c5\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc911\uc559 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uad00\ub9ac \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uae38\uace0 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \ud611\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub9e5\ub77d \ud33d\ucc3d, \uc624\ub958 \ucd95\uc801 \ubc0f \uc800\uc870\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc870\uc815 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 StackPlanner\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO.

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.", "AI":
