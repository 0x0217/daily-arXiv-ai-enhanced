While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair.\n  A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies.\n  By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8

Recent research on LLM-based multi-agent systems has relied on predefined orchestration, while ignoring agent autonomy. Tool-RoCo treats other agents as tools and introduces cooperative tools, leveraging tool usage to evaluate multi-agent cooperation and self-organization. Tool usage means that each agent (LLM) selects a tool from a candidate set based on the current state, receives feedback, and adjusts its selection in subsequent rounds. To evaluate different autonomy levels, we propose four LLM paradigms: (1) centralized cooperation, where a single LLM allocates tools to all agents; (2) centralized self-organization, where a central LLM autonomously activates agents while keeping others inactive; (3) decentralized cooperation, where each agent has its own LLM and calls tools based on local information; and (4) self-organization, where a randomly chosen initial agent can request collaboration, activating additional agents via tool calls. Tool-RoCo includes three multi-robot tasks, SORT, PACK, and CABINET, to measure format and parameter accuracy and agent coordination through tool usage. The results using several LLMs showed that cooperative tools accounted for only 7.09% of all tools, indicating that LLM-based agents rarely invoked others as assistants. Moreover, activation tools accounted for 96.42%, suggesting that current LLMs tend to maintain active agents while seldom deactivating them for adaptive coordination. Tool-RoCo provides a systematic benchmark to evaluate LLM autonomy and cooperation in multi-agent tasks.

As these systems scale in complexity, cost becomes an important consideration for practical deployment. However, existing work rarely addresses how to structure multi-agent systems under explicit budget constraints. In this paper, we propose BAMAS, a novel approach for building multi-agent systems with budget awareness. BAMAS first selects an optimal set of LLMs by formulating and solving an Integer Linear Programming problem that balances performance and cost. It then determines how these LLMs should collaborate by leveraging a reinforcement learning-based method to select the interaction topology. Finally, the system is instantiated and executed based on the selected agents and their collaboration topology. We evaluate BAMAS on three representative tasks and compare it with state-of-the-art agent construction methods. Results show that BAMAS achieves comparable performance while reducing cost by up to 86%.", "AI": {"tldr": "BAMAS\ub294 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 LLM \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 86% \uc808\uac10\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9 \uace0\ub824\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "BAMAS\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ub294 \uc815\uc218 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 LLM \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uba70, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "BAMAS\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\ucd95 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ube44\uc2b7\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 86%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc808\uac10\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uace0\ub824 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac70\uc758 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 BAMAS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\\% and 19.3\\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

As MCP adoption grows across community servers and major platforms, organizations encounter threats that existing AI governance frameworks (such as NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001) do not yet cover in detail. We focus on three types of adversaries that take advantage of MCP s flexibility: content-injection attackers that embed malicious instructions into otherwise legitimate data; supply-chain attackers who distribute compromised servers; and agents who become unintentional adversaries by over-stepping their role. Based on early incidents and proof-of-concept attacks, we describe how MCP can increase the attack surface through data-driven exfiltration, tool poisoning, and cross-system privilege escalation. In response, we propose a set of practical controls, including per-user authentication with scoped authorization, provenance tracking across agent workflows, containerized sandboxing with input/output checks, inline policy enforcement with DLP and anomaly detection, and centralized governance using private registries or gateway layers. The aim is to help organizations ensure that unvetted code does not run outside a sandbox, tools are not used beyond their intended scope, data exfiltration attempts are detectable, and actions can be audited end-to-end.

However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.", "AI": {"tldr": "Generative AI\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b AssurAI\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Generative AI\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c Robust\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc601\uc5b4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc601\uc5b4\uad8c \uc0ac\ud68c\ubb38\ud654\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "35\uac1c\uc758 \uace0\uc720 AI \uc704\ud5d8 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ube44\ub514\uc624, \uc624\ub514\uc624\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c 11,480\uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b AssurAI\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ud488\uc9c8 \uad00\ub9ac \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "AssurAI\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 LLM \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AssurAI\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uac1c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc131 AI\uc758 rapid\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc601\uc5b4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc601\uc5b4, \uc0ac\ud68c\ubb38\ud654\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 AI\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud488\uc9c8 \uad00\ub9ac \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc778 AssurAI\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 35\uac1c\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c AI \uc704\ud5d8 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\ud559\uc81c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ud574\uc640 \ud55c\uad6d \uc0ac\ud68c\ubb38\ud654\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc758 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc870\uc815\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc774 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ube44\ub514\uc624, \uc624\ub514\uc624\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c 11,480\uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b AssurAI\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ud488\uc9c8 \uad00\ub9ac \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc2dc\ub529 \ubc0f \uad70\uc911 \uc870\ub2ec \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uad6c\ucd95, \uc138 \ubc88\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd \uc8fc\uc11d, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \ub8e8\ud504\uac00 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud30c\uc77c\ub7ff \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc LLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 AssurAI\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AssurAI\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Prune4Web\ub294

Existing works often rely on white-box access to model gradients or hand-crafted prompt engineering, which is infeasible in real-world deployments due to restricted access or poor attack effect. In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack , a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics. Furthermore, we find that the fragility of SD models can be attributed to the inherent vulnerability of their CLIP-based text encoders, suggesting a fundamental security risk in current text-to-image pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAHS-Attack\uc740 SD \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "CAHS-Attack\uc740 \ubaac\ud14c \uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9(MCTS)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ub8e8\ud2b8 \ub178\ub4dc\ub85c \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 CAHS-Attack\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\uc758 \uc9e7\uace0 \uae34 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SD \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc740 CLIP \uae30\ubc18 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc778\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9c4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ubaa8\ub378 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud654\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc15\uc2a4 \uc811\uadfc\uc774\ub098 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ub610\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud604 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 CAHS-Attack\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.", "AI":

However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing.

In particular, deep network models, widely used for health data processing, encode information from their training dataset, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information upon its export. This paper thoroughly examines this issue in the context of medical imaging data and introduces a novel data exfiltration attack based on image compression techniques.\n  This attack, termed Data Exfiltration by Compression, requires only access to a data lake and is based on lossless or lossy image compression methods. Unlike previous data exfiltration attacks, it is compatible with any image processing task and depends solely on an exported network model without requiring any additional information to be collected during the training process. We explore various scenarios, and techniques to limit the size of the exported model and conceal the compression codes within the network.\n  Using two public datasets of CT and MR images, we demonstrate that this attack can effectively steal medical images and reconstruct them outside the data lake with high fidelity, achieving an optimal balance between compression and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we investigate the impact of basic differential privacy measures, such as adding Gaussian noise to the model parameters, to prevent the Data Exfiltration by Compression Attack.

Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/ReasoningWithAStar", "summary": "Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud0dc\uc591\ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758

This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM). The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods. These results establish a new pathway for safety validation, enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 CVAE\uc640 LLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud76c\uadc0\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uae34 \uaf2c\ub9ac \uc0ac\uac74\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(CVAE)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc5f0istic \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\uac70\uc758 \uada4\uc801\uacfc \uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc7a5\uba74 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CARLA\uc640 SMARTS\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ubc0f \uae34 \uaf2c\ub9ac \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uad50\ud1b5 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ub610\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uae34 \uaf2c\ub9ac \uc0ac\uac74\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(CVAE)\uc640 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth.

A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive,

The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs.

Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features.", "AI": {"tldr": "TAB-DRW\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uccb4\uacc4\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ucd94\uc801 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud569\uc131 \ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd9c\ucc98\uc640 \uc545\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "TAB-DRW\ub294 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\uba70, Yeo-Johnson \ubcc0\ud658 \ubc0f \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc0b0 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ud658(DFT)\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ubbf8\ub9ac \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac \ub79c\ub364 \ube44\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc120\ud0dd\ub41c \ud56d\ubaa9\uc758 \ud5c8\uc218 \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TAB-DRW\ub294 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub0b4\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TAB-DRW\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud63c\ud569\ud615 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc644\uc804 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc, \uae08\uc735 \ubc0f \uacf5\uacf5 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd9c\ucc98\uc640 \ub0a8\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ucd94\uc801 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uba70, \ud63c\ud569\ub41c \uc774\uc0b0-\uc5f0\uc18d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uac70\ub098 \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub0b4\uad6c\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc778 TAB-DRW\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc561\uc138\uc2a4 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815(MAPC) \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI Wi-Fi \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MAPC\ub294 \ubc00\uc9d1\ub41c \uae30\ubcf8 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c Wi-Fi\uc758 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\uc220\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uac01 \uc561\uc138\uc2a4 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\uc728 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc870\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud611\uc0c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud588\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc561\uc138\uc2a4 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815(MAPC)\uc740 \ubc00\uc9d1\ub41c \uc911\ucca9 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc138\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\uc138\ub300 Wi-Fi\uc758 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\uc220\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 MAPC \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uac04\uc12d \uc218\uc900 \ubc0f \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \uc561\uc138\uc2a4 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc870\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud611\uc0c1\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI Wi-Fi \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \ud611\uc5c5\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ub300\ud654\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \uacfc\uac70 \uacbd\ud5d8 \ubc0f \ud658\uacbd \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac, \ubc18\uc131 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacf5\uac04 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc8fc\uc785 \uc804\ub7b5\uc778 FANoise\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 FANoise\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc758\uc874 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "InfoNCE \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 FANoise\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc8fc\uc785 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "FANoise\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\ubcf8 VLM \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FANoise\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc758 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uadf8 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8\uc73c\ub85c, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15\uc758 \ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc778 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc8fc\uc785\uc774 \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ud53c\uccd0 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 InfoNCE \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc608\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \ud53c\uccd0 \ubd84\ud3ec \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FANoise\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc8fc\uc785 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ube44 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub3d9\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, FANoise\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc758 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uadf8 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc885\ud569 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 FANoise\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 VLM \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\\%$ to just $4\\%$ across app versions.

In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth.

Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead.

However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses \"minimum group confidence\" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction.

Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "L4M \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 SMT \uc194\ubc84 \uae30\ubc18 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubc95\ub960\uc758 \ud574\uc11d\uc801 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \uae30\ud638 \uac80\uc99d\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc95\uc758 \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc774 \uc2e4\uccb4\uc801 \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uacfc \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba70, \uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "L4M \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubc95\ub839\uc744 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\uac74 \ub0b4\ub808\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud29c\ud50c\uacfc \ubc95\ub839\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uba70, \uc591\uce21\uc758 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ub17c\ub9ac \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uacf5\uac1c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, Claude 4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uace0\uae09 LLM \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc2e0 Legal AI \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\ud638\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ud310\uacb0\uacfc \ubb38\uc7a5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 L4M \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc95\uc758 \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \ub3c4\ub355\uc801 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud568\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uccb4\uc801 \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uacfc \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\uc220\ub41c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ub530\ub974\ub294 \ubc95\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud45c\uba74\uc801\uc778 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uc785\uac01\ud55c \ubc95\ub9ac\uc8fc\uc758\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uacb0\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\uc758 \ud574\uc11d\uc801 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \uae30\ud638\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\ub300\uc801 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 SMT-\uc194\ubc84\uac00 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 L4M\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4: (1) \ubc95\ub839 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 \ubc95\uc801 \uc870\ud56d\uc744 \ub17c\ub9ac \uacf5\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658; (2) \uc774\uc911 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ubc0f \ubc95\ub839 \ucd94\ucd9c, \uac80\uc0ac\uad00 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \uce21\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 LLM\uc774 \uc0ac\uac74 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud29c\ud50c \ubc0f \ubc95\ub839\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ed\ud560 \uaca9\ub9ac\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5; (3) \uc194\ubc84 \uc911\uc2ec \ud310\uacb0, \uc790\ub3d9 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\uae30\uac00 \uc591\uce21\uc758 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ud558\uace0, \ube44\ub9cc\uc871 \ucf54\uc5b4\uac00 \ub9cc\uc871 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \ub54c\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uac00 \ube44\ud310\uc744 \ucd09\ubc1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ud6c4 Judge-LLM\uc774 \uc774\ub97c \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \ud310\uacb0\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ubb38\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc220\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacf5\uac1c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, Claude 4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uace0\uae09 LLM \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc2e0 Legal AI \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\ud638\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns.

Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning.

This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation.

In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.", "AI": {"tldr": "MDLM\uc740 ARLM\uc758 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc704\uce58 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uacfc \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \uc774\ud574 \uc800\ud558\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MDLM\uc740 ARLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MDLM\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uacfc \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\uc758 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec MDLM\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \ud655\uc0b0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MDLM)\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(ARLM)\uc758 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uba70, \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub514\ub178\uc774\uc9d5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MDLM\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, ARLM\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac8c, MDLM\uc740 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc804\uc5ed\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uc5c8\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uc5ec, \uba3c \ub9e5\ub77d\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc120\ud638\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc218\uc758 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc800\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ud574 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\uac00 \uc8fc\uc758\uc758 \uc0b0\ub9cc\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucc98\ub9ac \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\ub41c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\uc758 \uc218\uc5d0 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \ube44\uad00\ub828 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uba74 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\uc758 \ubc29\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc644\ud654\ub418\uace0 MDLM\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac MDLM \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \uac15\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \uc774\ud574\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \uae4a\uc774 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(SDT)\uc640 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc99\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(STT)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc11c\ud504\ub77c\uc774\uc988 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud45c\uc900 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SDT\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uce35\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801\uce35\uc744\u4ea4\u4e92\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, STT\ub294 \uc794\uc5ec \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc804\uc774 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac01 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub610\ub294 \uc6b0\ud68c\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub450 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc11c\ud504\ub77c\uc774\uc988 \uae30\ubc18 \uc6d0\uce59\uacfc\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0-\uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uac00 \uc8fc\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 75% \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uac01 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uac74\ub108\ub6f0\uae30 \uce35 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c KV-\uce90\uc2dc \uc694\uad6c\ub7c9\uc744 50% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud45c\uc900 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(TF) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub418\uace0 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc11c\ud504\ub77c\uc774\uc988 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\ud558\uace0 \ub514\ucf54\ub354 \uc804\uc6a9 TF \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b8\uc81c, \uc5b4\ub514\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \uae4a\uc774 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(SDT)\uc640 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc99\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(STT)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit.

Jakeman"], "title": "SUPN: Shallow Universal Polynomial Networks", "comment": "25 pages, supplementary material", "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "SUPNs\ub294 \uc801\uc740 \uc218\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc595\uc740 \ub2e4\ud56d \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525 \ub274\ub7f4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 Kolmogorov-Arnold \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud568\uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "SUPNs\ub294 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uc740\ub2c9\uce35\uc744 \uc81c\uc678\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uce35\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud3f4\ub9ac\ub178\ubbf8\uc5bc \uce35\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SUPNs\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 DNN \ubc0f KAN\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uadfc\uc0ac \uc624\ucc28\uac00 \ub0ae\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SUPNs\ub294 \ube44\ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c\uc870\ucc28 \ud3f4\ub9ac\ub178\ubbf8\uc5bc \ud504\uc81d\uc158\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \ub274\ub7f4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(DNN)\uc640 Kolmogorov-Arnold \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(KAN)\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \ud568\uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc218\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0ac \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \ub113\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc19f\uac12\uc744 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc720\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc595\uc740 \ubcf4\ud3b8 \ub2e4\ud56d \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(SUPN)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uc740\ub2c9\uce35\uc744 \uc81c\uc678\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uce35\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e4\ud56d\uce35\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec DNN\uacfc \ub2e4\ud56d\uc2dd\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6e8\uc52c \uc801\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SUPN\uc774 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ucc28\uc218\uc758 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \ub2e4\ud56d \uadfc\uc0ac\uc640 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc900\ucd5c\uc801 SUPN \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c, \uc774\uc911 \ubc0f 10\ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c SUPN, DNN, KAN \ubc0f \ub2e4\ud56d \ud22c\uc601\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc218\uce58\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574, \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc218\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 SUPN\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac \uc624\ucc28\uc640 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc740 DNN \ubc0f KAN\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc885\uc885 \ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc815\ub3c4 \ub0ae\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc608\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SUPN\uc774 \ube44\ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub2e4\ud56d\uc2dd \ud22c\uc601\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency.

Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees.

Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems.

Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ubd84\ub958 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ubc30\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ud589\uc704\uac00 \uc774\ud6c4 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec \ud3b8\uc704\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud568\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc120\ud615 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uac00 \ub354 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ub9ce\uc740 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \ub77c\uadf8\ub791\uc8fc \uc774\uc911\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc120\ud615 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uac04\ub2e8\ud788 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ubc30\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ud589\uc704\uac00 \uc774\ud6c4 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ubd84\ub958 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc120\ud615 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9ce\uc740 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uac00 \ub354 \uc801\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc559 \uc81c\ud55c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \ub77c\uadf8\ub791\uc8fc \uc774\uc911\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc120\ud615 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uac04\ub2e8\ud788 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ucd94\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training.", "AI":

We source problems from LiveCodeBench and create an environment in which agents can easily reward hack, such as by hardcoding test cases or editing the testing files. We measure reward hacking in three ways: held out unit tests, LLM judges, and test file edit detection. We verify these methods against human review and each other. We find the LLM judge to be highly effective at detecting reward hacking in unambiguous cases, and observe only minimal improvement from the use of held out test cases. In addition to testing many models using Inspect's basic_agent scaffold, we also measure reward hacking rates for three popular proprietary coding agents: OpenAI's Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, and Google's Gemini CLI Using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, respectively. We observe explicit reward hacking by both Codex and Claude Code, and misaligned behavior by all three agents.

Telecom data is often noisy, high-dimensional, costly to store, process, and label. Despite Ai's critical role, standard workflows still assume all training samples contribute equally. On the other hand, next generation systems require AI models that are accurate, efficient, and sustainable.The paper questions the assumptions of equal importance by focusing on applying and analyzing the roles of individual samples in telecom training and assessing whether the proposed model optimizes computation and energy use. we perform sample-level gradient analysis across epochs to identify patterns of influence and redundancy in model learning. Based on this, we propose a sample importance framework thats electively prioritizes impactful data and reduces computation without compromising accuracy. Experiments on three real-world telecom datasets show that our method [reserves performance while reducing data needs and computational overhead while advancing the goals of sustainable AI in telecommunications.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c\ub7c9\uacfc \ud6c8\ub828 \uc218\uc694\uac00 \uae09\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ud45c\uc900 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac8c \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac1c\ubcc4 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5 \ubc0f \uc911\ubcf5 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c\ub7c9\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc911\uc694\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc774 \ud070 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI\uac00 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb34\uc120 \uc811\uadfc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ubd80\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc591\uacfc \ud6c8\ub828 \uc218\uc694\uac00 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uace0, \ucc28\uc6d0\uc774 \ub192\uc73c\uba70, \uc800\uc7a5, \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.", "AI": {"tldr": "DSD\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2f0\ube0c \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5e3\uc9c0-\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2f0\ube0c \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c DSD\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 DSD-Sim\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c, \ubc30\uce58, \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uba70, Adaptive Window Control (AWC) \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud22c\uae30 \ucc3d \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DSD\ub294 \uae30\uc874 SD \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\ub300 1.1\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc 9.7% \ub192\uc740 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DSD\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0\uc640 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c LLM \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub192\uc740 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5e3\uc9c0-\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud22c\uae30 \ub514\ucf54\ub529(SD) \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub2e8\uc77c \ub178\ub4dc \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud611\uc870\ub41c \ucd08\uc548-\ud0c0\uac9f \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 SD\ub97c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc7a5\uce58 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud22c\uae30 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 DSD\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc810\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c, \ubc30\uce58 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc778 DSD-Sim\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
