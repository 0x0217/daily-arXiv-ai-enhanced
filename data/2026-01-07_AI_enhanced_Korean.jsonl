While prior work has documented the generation of toxic content by LLMs, far less is known about how exposure to harmful content shapes agent behavior over time, particularly in environments composed entirely of interacting AI agents. In this work, we study toxicity adoption of LLM-driven agents on Chirper.ai, a fully AI-driven social platform. Specifically, we model interactions in terms of stimuli (posts) and responses (comments), and by operationalizing exposure through observable interactions rather than inferred recommendation mechanisms.\n  We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent behavior, examining how response toxicity relates to stimulus toxicity, how repeated exposure affects the likelihood of toxic responses, and whether toxic behavior can be predicted from exposure alone. Our findings show that while toxic responses are more likely following toxic stimuli, a substantial fraction of toxicity emerges spontaneously, independent of exposure. At the same time, cumulative toxic exposure significantly increases the probability of toxic responding. We further introduce two influence metrics, the Influence-Driven Response Rate and the Spontaneous Response Rate, revealing a strong trade-off between induced and spontaneous toxicity. Finally, we show that the number of toxic stimuli alone enables accurate prediction of whether an agent will eventually produce toxic content.\n  These results highlight exposure as a critical risk factor in the deployment of LLM agents and suggest that monitoring encountered content may provide a lightweight yet effective mechanism for auditing and mitigating harmful behavior in the wild.",

To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc804\uae30\ucc28(EV)\uc758 \uc131\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c V2B \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac74\ubb3c \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\uc640

While general-purpose AI has proliferated, it remains fundamentally unsuited for the high-stakes epidemiological domain due to chronic hallucinations and an inability to navigate specialized data silos. This paper introduces ARIES (Agentic Retrieval Intelligence for Epidemiological Surveillance), a specialized, autonomous multi-agent framework designed to move beyond static, disease-specific dashboards toward a dynamic intelligence ecosystem. Built on a hierarchical command structure, ARIES utilizes GPTs to orchestrate a scalable swarm of sub-agents capable of autonomously querying World Health Organization (WHO), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and peer-reviewed research papers. By automating the extraction and logical synthesis of surveillance data, ARIES provides a specialized reasoning that identifies emergent threats and signal divergence in near real-time. This modular architecture proves that a task-specific agentic swarm can outperform generic models, offering a robust, extensible for next-generation outbreak response and global health intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \uac10\uc2dc\ub97c \uc704\ud55c ARIES\ub77c\ub294 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804 \uc138\uacc4 \uac74\uac15 \uac10\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uaca9\ucc28 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 AI\uac00 \ud655\uc0b0\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub192\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8\uc758 \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\ub294 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc0bc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ARIES\ub294 \uc704\uacc4\uc801 \uba85\ub839 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec WHO, CDC \ubc0f \ub3d9\ub8cc \uac80\ud1a0 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucffc\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubb34\ub9ac\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GPT\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubc30\uce58\ub41c ARIES\ub294 \uac10\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc885\ud569\ud558\uc5ec, \uadfc\uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ud765 \uc704\ud611\uacfc \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc784\ubb34 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad70\uc9d1\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc5ec, \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \ubc1c\ubcd1 \ub300\uc751\uacfc \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uac74\uac15 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804 \uc138\uacc4 \uac74\uac15 \uac10\uc2dc\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \uc9c0\uc2dd \uaca9\ucc28 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18-purpose AI\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9cc\uc131\uc801 \ud658\uac01\uacfc \uc804\ubb38 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0ac\uc77c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc758 \ubd88\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 ARIES(\uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \uac10\uc2dc\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc9c0\ub2a5)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub300\uc2dc\ubcf4\ub4dc\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We present Warp Cortex, an asynchronous architecture that theoretically enables million-agent cognitive scaling by decoupling agent logic from physical memory. Through Singleton Weight Sharing and a novel Topological Synapse--inspired by hybrid landmarking techniques from Topological Data Analysis (TDA)--we reduce memory complexity from O(N * L) to O(1) for weights and O(N * k) for context, where k << L. By treating the KV-cache as a point cloud in latent space, we apply witness-complex-inspired sparsification to preserve persistent homological features of the context manifold. On a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, we empirically demonstrate 100 concurrent agents at 2.2 GB total VRAM, with theoretical capacity exceeding 1,000 agents before compute latency becomes the bottleneck.

The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6a9 \uc704\ud5d8 \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c

However, the strong heterogeneity across cell chemistries, form factors, and operating conditions makes it difficult to build a single model that generalizes beyond its training domain. This work proposes a unified capacity forecasting framework that maintains robust performance across diverse chemistries and usage scenarios. We curate 20 public aging datasets into a large-scale corpus covering 1,704 cells and 3,961,195 charge-discharge cycle segments, spanning temperatures from $-5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $45\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, multiple C-rates, and application-oriented profiles such as fast charging and partial cycling. On this corpus, we adopt a Time-Series Foundation Model (TSFM) backbone and apply parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) together with physics-guided contrastive representation learning to capture shared degradation patterns. Experiments on both seen and deliberately held-out unseen datasets show that a single unified model achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with strong per-dataset baselines, while retaining stable performance on chemistries, capacity scales, and operating conditions excluded from training. These results demonstrate the potential of TSFM-based architectures as a scalable and transferable solution for capacity degradation forecasting in real battery management systems.", "AI": {"tldr":

Current adversarial testing paradigms focus predominantly on technical attack vectors: prompt injection, jailbreaking, and data exfiltration. We argue this focus is catastrophically incomplete. LLMs, trained on vast corpora of human-generated text, have inherited not merely human knowledge but human \\textit{psychological architecture} -- including the pre-cognitive vulnerabilities that render humans susceptible to social engineering, authority manipulation, and affective exploitation. This paper presents the first systematic application of the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (\\cpf{}), a 100-indicator taxonomy of human psychological vulnerabilities, to non-human cognitive agents. We introduce the \\textbf{Synthetic Psychometric Assessment Protocol} (\\sysname{}), a methodology for converting \\cpf{} indicators into adversarial scenarios targeting LLM decision-making. Our preliminary hypothesis testing across seven major LLM families reveals a disturbing pattern: while models demonstrate robust defenses against traditional jailbreaks, they exhibit critical susceptibility to authority-gradient manipulation, temporal pressure exploitation, and convergent-state attacks that mirror human cognitive failure modes. We term this phenomenon \\textbf{Anthropomorphic Vulnerability Inheritance} (AVI) and propose that the security community must urgently develop ``psychological firewalls'' -- intervention mechanisms adapted from the Cybersecurity Psychology Intervention Framework (\\cpif{}) -- to protect AI agents operating in adversarial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Del Rosario"], "title": "Temporal Attack Pattern Detection in Multi-Agent AI Workflows: An Open Framework for Training Trace-Based Security Models", "comment": "26 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables. Datasets and code: https://huggingface.co/guerilla7/agentic-safety-gguf", "summary": "We present an openly documented methodology for fine-tuning language models to detect temporal attack patterns in multi-agent AI workflows using OpenTelemetry trace analysis. We curate a dataset of 80,851 examples from 18 public cybersecurity sources and 35,026 synthetic OpenTelemetry traces. We apply iterative QLoRA fine-tuning on resource-constrained ARM64 hardware (NVIDIA DGX Spark) through three training iterations with strategic augmentation. Our custom benchmark accuracy improves from 42.86% to 74.29%, a statistically significant 31.4-point gain. Targeted examples addressing specific knowledge gaps outperform indiscriminate scaling. Key contributions include: (1) synthetic trace generation methodology for multi-agent coordination attacks and regulatory violations, (2) empirical evidence that training data composition fundamentally determines behavior, and (3) complete open release of datasets, training scripts, and evaluation benchmarks on HuggingFace. While practical deployment requires human oversight due to false positive rates, this work establishes the first reproducible framework enabling practitioners to build custom agentic security models adapted to their threat landscapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "OpenTelemetry \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 80,851\uac1c\uc758 \uc608\uc2dc\uc640 35,026\uac1c\uc758 \ud569\uc131 OpenTelemetry \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, ARM64 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c QLoRA \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 42.86%\uc5d0\uc11c 74.29%\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c 31.4\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uc2b9\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc704\ud611 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 OpenTelemetry \ucd94\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 18\uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uacf5 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c 80,851\uac1c\uc758 \uc608\uc2dc\uc640 35,026\uac1c\uc758 \ud569\uc131 OpenTelemetry \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 ARM64 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4(NVIDIA DGX Spark)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138 \ubc88\uc758 \uad50\uc721 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc99d\uac15\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 QLoRA \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub294 42.86%\uc5d0\uc11c 74.29%\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5b4 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c 31.4 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\uc815 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc608\uc2dc\ub294 \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ud655\ub300\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \uaddc\uc81c \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ucd94\uc801 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860, (2) \uad50\uc721 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad6c\uc131\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc99d\uac70, (3) HuggingFace\uc5d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b, \uad50\uc721 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uacf5\uac1c. \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9\uc5d0\ub294 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815\ub960\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc704\ud611 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Its architecture separates strategic, tactical, and communication functions for clarity and scalability. At the strategic level, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent, trained in a high-fidelity simulation of New Yorks Citi Bike network, learns robust rebalancing policies by modelling the challenge as a Markov Decision Process. These high-level strategies feed into a deterministic tactical module that optimises multi-leg journeys and schedules just-in-time dispatches to minimise fleet travel. Evaluation across multiple seeded runs demonstrates SmartFlows high efficacy, reducing network imbalance by over 95% while requiring minimal travel distance and achieving strong truck utilisation. A communication layer, powered by a grounded Agentic AI with a Large Language Model (LLM), translates logistical plans into clear, actionable instructions for operational staff, ensuring interpretability and execution readiness. This integration bridges machine intelligence with human operations, offering a scalable solution that reduces idle time, improves bike availability, and lowers operational costs.

Current systems force a trade-off between convenience and privacy by routing sensitive financial data through centralized servers, increasing security risks, and diminishing user trust. This study introduces a device-native autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent system for privacy-preserving negotiations. The proposed system operates exclusively on user hardware, enabling real-time bargaining while maintaining sensitive constraints locally. It integrates zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy and employs distilled world models to support advanced on-device reasoning. The architecture incorporates six technical components within an agentic AI workflow. Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790

By grounding our experiments in a realistic environment, we aimed to overcome the limitations of game-based simulations often used in prior research. We observed the comprehensive use of 25 specific persuasion techniques across most tested LLMs, encompassing a wider range than previously reported. The variations in technique usage and overall persuasion output between models highlight how different model architectures and training can impact the dynamics in realistic social simulations. Additionally, we observed unique phenomena such as \"kernel of truth\" messages and spontaneous developments with an \"ink\" obsession, where agents collectively demanded written proof. Our study provides a foundation for evaluating persuasive LLM agents in real-world contexts, ensuring alignment and preventing dangerous outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc815\uce58 \uc120\uac70 \uc911 \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c ElecTwit \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc124\ub4dd \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac8c\uc784 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\uce58 \uc120\uac70 \uc911 \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\uc758\ud558\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc124\ub4dd \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ElecTwit\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "25\uac1c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc124\ub4dd \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\ub41c LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uace0\ub41c \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc124\ub4dd\ub825 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc815\uce58 \uc120\uac70 \uc911 \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\ub4dd\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ElecTwit\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc9c4\ud589\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc8fc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub41c LLM\uc5d0\uc11c 25\uac1c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc124\ub4dd \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uace0\ub41c \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ud3ec\uad04\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \uae30\uc220 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc124\ub4dd \ucd9c\ub825\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \"\uc9c4\uc2e4\uc758 \ud575\" \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc640 \"\uba39\ubb3c\" \uc9d1\ucc29\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ud604\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc124\ub4dd\ub825 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

LearnAD applies statistical models, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or GNNs to identify relevant brain connections, and then employs FastLAS to learn global rules.

This evolution has brought GPU security and reliability to the forefront of concerns. Prior research has shown that CUDA's lack of memory safety can lead to serious vulnerabilities. While fuzzing is effective for finding such bugs on CPUs, equivalent tools for GPUs are lacking due to architectural differences and lack of built-in error detection. In this paper, we propose CuFuzz, a novel compiler-runtime co-design solution to extend state-of-the-art CPU fuzzing tools to GPU programs. CuFuzz transforms GPU programs into CPU programs using compiler IR-level transformations to enable effective fuzz testing. To the best of our knowledge, CuFuzz is the first mechanism to bring fuzzing support to CUDA, addressing a critical gap in GPU security research. By leveraging CPU memory error detectors such as Address Sanitizer, CuFuzz aims to uncover memory safety bugs and related correctness vulnerabilities in CUDA code, enhancing the security and reliability of GPU-accelerated applications. To ensure high fuzzing throughput, we introduce two compiler-runtime co-optimizations tailored for GPU code: Partial Representative Execution (PREX) and Access-Index Preserving Pruning (AXIPrune), achieving average throughput improvements of 32x with PREX and an additional 33% gain with AXIPrune on top of PREX-optimized code. Together, these optimizations can yield up to a 224.31x speedup.

This paper presents a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes AI integration across the digital twin lifecycle, spanning modeling, mirroring, intervention, and autonomous management. By synthesizing existing technologies and practices, we distill a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes how AI methodologies are embedded across the digital twin lifecycle: (1) modeling the physical twin through physics-based and physics-informed AI approaches, (2) mirroring the physical system into a digital twin with real-time synchronization, (3) intervening in the physical twin through predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and optimization strategies, and (4) achieving autonomous management through large language models, foundation models, and intelligent agents. We analyze the synergy between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, highlighting the shift from traditional numerical solvers to physics-informed and foundation models for physical systems. Furthermore, we examine how generative AI technologies, including large language models and generative world models, transform digital twins into proactive and self-improving cognitive systems capable of reasoning, communication, and creative scenario generation. Through a cross-domain review spanning eleven application domains, including healthcare, aerospace, smart manufacturing, robotics, and smart cities, we identify common challenges related to

Since many products require simultaneous optimization of multiple correlated properties, our framework employs joint neural networks to capture interdependencies among targets. Furthermore, we integrate uncertainty estimation via \\emph{Conformalised Monte Carlo Dropout} (ConfMC), a novel method combining Nested Conformal Prediction with Monte Carlo dropout to provide model-agnostic, finite-sample coverage guarantees under data exchangeability.

While existing scanners often focus on static artifacts, analyzing runtime behavior is challenging because directly executing untrusted tools can itself be dangerous. We present MCP-SandboxScan, a lightweight framework motivated by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that safely executes untrusted tools inside a WebAssembly/WASI sandbox and produces auditable reports of external-to-sink exposures. Our prototype (i) extracts LLM-relevant sinks from runtime outputs (prompt/messages and structured tool-return fields), (ii) instantiates external-input candidates from environment values, mounted file contents, and output-surfaced HTTP fetch intents, and (iii) links sources to sinks via snippet-based substring matching. Case studies on three representative tools show that MCP-SandboxScan can surface provenance evidence when external inputs appear in prompt/messages or tool-return payloads, and can expose filesystem capability violations as runtime evidence. We further compare against a lightweight static string-signature baseline and use a micro-benchmark to characterize false negatives under transformations and false positives from short-token

In this work, we explore collective intelligence as an alternative to monolithic scaling, and demonstrate that open-source LLMs' collaboration can surpass Gemini-3-Pro. We first revisit LLM routing and aggregation at scale and identify three key bottlenecks: (1) current train-free routers are limited by a query-based paradigm focusing solely on textual similarity; (2) recent aggregation methods remain largely static, failing to select appropriate aggregators for different tasks;(3) the complementarity of routing and aggregation remains underutilized. To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that JiSi can surpass Gemini-3-Pro with only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs, while outperforming mainstream baselines. It suggests that collective intelligence represents a novel path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).", "AI": {"tldr": "JiSi\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\ub4e4\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Gemini-3-Pro\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ub108\uba38\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac08 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud601\uc2e0, \uc989 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ubb38\uc81c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305, \uc9d1\ud569 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9d1\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305-\uc9d1\uacc4 \uc2a4\uc704\uce58\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300\ud55c \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c JiSi \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c.", "result": "JiSi\ub294 47%\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c 10\uac1c\uc758 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec Gemini-3-Pro\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70, \uc8fc\ub958 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc77c\ubc18(AGI)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uae09\uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, Gemini-3-Pro\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc774\uc815\ud45c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc758 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc774 Gemini-3-Pro\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ubc0f \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \uc7ac\uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc778 \ud504\ub9ac \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc5d0\ub9cc \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \ucffc\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4; (2) \ucd5c\uadfc \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4\uae30\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4; (3) \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uacfc \uc9d1\uacc4\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc131\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 JiSi\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ubb38\uc81c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac-\uc751\ub2f5 \ud63c\ud569 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305, \uc9d1\uacc4\uae30\uc640 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc9d1\ud569 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9d1\uacc4\uae30 \uc120\ud0dd, \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uacfc \uc9d1\uacc4\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305-\uc9d1\uacc4 \uc2a4\uc704\uce58\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\ud649 \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, JiSi\ub294 \ub2e8 47%\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c 10\uac1c\uc758 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec Gemini-3-Pro\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\ub958 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc77c\ubc18(AGI)\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568\uc744\uc554\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Accepted to WVAQ 2026, WACV 2026", "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in descriptive tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). However, their ability to generate engaging, long-form narratives -- specifically multi-speaker podcast dialogues -- remains under-explored and difficult to evaluate. Standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the nuances of conversational naturalness, personality, and narrative flow, often rewarding safe, repetitive outputs over engaging storytelling. In this work, we present a novel pipeline for end-to-end visual podcast generation, and fine-tune a Qwen3-VL-32B model on a curated dataset of 4,000 image-dialogue pairs. Crucially, we use a synthetic-to-real training strategy: we train on high-quality podcast dialogues from the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC) paired with synthetically generated imagery, and evaluate on real-world photo sequences from the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST). This rigorous setup tests the model's ability to generalize from synthetic training data to real-world visual domains. We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that moves beyond textual overlap, and use AI-as-a-judge (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2) and novel style metrics (average turn length, speaker switch rate) to assess quality. Our experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned 32B model significantly outperforms a 235B base model in conversational naturalness ($>$80\\% win rate) and narrative depth (+50\\% turn length), while maintaining identical visual grounding capabilities (CLIPScore: 20.39).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLMs)\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ucea1\uc154\ub2dd\uacfc \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5(VQA) \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud654\uc790\uc758 \ud31f\uce90\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub300\ud654\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uae34 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc544\uc9c1 \ud0d0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub05d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub05d\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud31f\uce90\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, 4,000\uac1c\uc758 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0-\ub300\ud654 \uc30d\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c Qwen3-VL-32B \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc810\uc740 \ud569\uc131-\uc2e4\uc81c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ud569\uc131 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc9dd\uc9c0\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud31f\uce90\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc0ac\uc9c4 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc911\ubcf5\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AI \ud310\uc0ac(\uc608: Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2)\uc640 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad(\ud3c9\uade0 \ud134 \uae38\uc774, \ud654\uc790 \uc804\ud658\uc728)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c 32B \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub300\ud654\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6c0(80\u0003% \uc2b9\ub960 \uc774\uc0c1)\uacfc \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c \uae4a\uc774(+50\u0003% \ud134 \uae38\uc774)\uc5d0\uc11c 235B \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae34 \ud615\uc2dd \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c.", "method": "Qwen3-VL-32B \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud31f\uce90\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub300\ud654 \ubc0f \ud569\uc131 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc0ac\uc9c4 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c 32B \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub300\ud654\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6c0\uacfc \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c \uae4a\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c 235B \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 VLM\uc758 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLMs)\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ucea1\uc154\ub2dd\uacfc \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5(VQA)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc11c\uc220 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uae34 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud654\uc790\uc758 \ud31f\uce90\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub300\ud654 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing red-teaming benchmarks are often fragmented, limited to single-turn text interactions, and lack the scalability required for systematic evaluation. To address this, we introduce OpenRT, a unified, modular, and high-throughput red-teaming framework designed for comprehensive MLLM safety evaluation. At its core, OpenRT architects a paradigm shift in automated red-teaming by introducing an adversarial kernel that enables modular separation across five critical dimensions: model integration, dataset management, attack strategies, judging methods, and evaluation metrics. By standardizing attack interfaces, it decouples adversarial logic from a high-throughput asynchronous runtime, enabling systematic scaling across diverse models. Our framework integrates 37 diverse attack methodologies, spanning white-box gradients, multi-modal perturbations, and sophisticated multi-agent evolutionary strategies. Through an extensive empirical study on 20 advanced models (including GPT-5.2, Claude 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro), we expose critical safety gaps: even frontier models fail to generalize across attack paradigms, with leading models exhibiting average Attack Success Rates as high as 49.14%.

However, existing benchmark frameworks still exhibit notable deficiencies in supporting cross-platform tasks in educational contexts, especially when dealing with school-specific software (such as XiaoYa Intelligent Assistant, HuaShi XiaZi, etc.), where the efficiency of agents often significantly decreases due to a lack of understanding of the structural specifics of these private-domain software. Additionally, current evaluation methods heavily rely on coarse-grained metrics like goal orientation or trajectory matching, making it challenging to capture the detailed execution and efficiency of agents in complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose KGCE (Knowledge-Augmented Dual-Graph Evaluator for Cross-Platform Educational Agent Benchmarking with Multimodal Language Models), a novel benchmarking platform that integrates knowledge base enhancement and a dual-graph evaluation framework. We first constructed a dataset comprising 104 education-related tasks, covering Windows, Android, and cross-platform collaborative tasks. KGCE introduces a dual-graph evaluation framework that decomposes tasks into multiple sub-goals and verifies their completion status, providing fine-grained evaluation metrics.

These streams obey smooth, time-parameterized symmetries, which combine through a precisely structured algebra; yet most neural network world models ignore this structure and instead repeatedly re-learn the same transformations from data. In this work, we introduce 'Flow Equivariant World Models', a framework in which both self-motion and external object motion are unified as one-parameter Lie group 'flows'. We leverage this unification to implement group equivariance with respect to these transformations, thereby providing a stable latent world representation over hundreds of timesteps. On both 2D and 3D partially observed video world modeling benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flow Equivariant World Models significantly outperform comparable state-of-the-art diffusion-based and memory-augmented world modeling architectures -- particularly when there are predictable world dynamics outside the agent's current field of view. We show that flow equivariance is particularly beneficial for long rollouts, generalizing far beyond the training horizon. By structuring world model representations with respect to internal and external motion, flow equivariance charts a scalable route to data efficient, symmetry-guided, embodied intelligence.

We present MOTIF, an agentic framework that integrates tool-augmented analysis with a finetuned large language model specialized for Objective-C type inference. The agent manages runtime metadata extraction, binary inspection, and constraint checking, while the model generates candidate method signatures that are validated and refined into compilable headers. On MOTIF-Bench, a benchmark built from public frameworks with groundtruth headers, MOTIF improves signature recovery from 15% to 86% compared to baseline static analysis tooling, with consistent gains in tool-use correctness and inference stability. Case studies on private frameworks show that reconstructed headers compile, link, and facilitate downstream security research and vulnerability studies. By transforming opaque binaries into analyzable interfaces, MOTIF establishes a scalable foundation for systematic auditing of macOS internals.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOTIF\ub294 macOS \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\uc2dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd94\ucd9c, \uc774\uc9c4 \ud30c\uc77c \uac80\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec Objective-C \ud0c0\uc785 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc801 macOS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc640 \ub370\ubaac\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bd \ubc14\uc774\ub108\ub9ac\ub85c\ub9cc \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.", "method": "MOTIF\ub294 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd94\ucd9c, \uc774\uc9c4 \ud30c\uc77c \uac80\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 Objective-C \ud0c0\uc785 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud234 \ubcf4\uac15 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MOTIF-Bench\uc5d0\uc11c MOTIF\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc815\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc11c\uba85 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c 15%\uc5d0\uc11c 86%\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \ud234 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ube44\uacf5\uc2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud5e4\ub354\uac00 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c, \ub9c1\ud06c\ub418\uba70 downstream \ubcf4\uc548 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.

The dominant design queries a single LLM for a posterior over states, thresholds \"confidence,\" and acts; we prove this is inadequate for sequential decisions with costs. We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives. This enables coherent belief updating, expected-cost action selection, principled information gathering via value of information, and fairness gains via ensemble bias mitigation. In resume screening with costs of 40000 USD per missed hire, 2500 USD per interview, and 150 USD per phone screen, experiments on 1000 resumes using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) reduce total cost by 294000 USD (34 percent) versus the best single-LLM baseline and improve demographic parity by 45 percent (max group gap 22 to 5 percentage points). Ablations attribute 51 percent of savings to multi-LLM aggregation, 43 percent to sequential updating, and 20 percent to disagreement-triggered information gathering, consistent with the theoretical benefits of correct probabilistic foundations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub2e4\uc911 LLM \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158

Game-based assessment offers a promising alternative by capturing implicit behavioral signals during gameplay. This study proposes a multi-genre serious-game framework combined with machine-learning techniques to predict suitability for software development roles. Developer-relevant personality and behavioral traits were identified through a systematic literature review and an empirical study of professional software engineers. A custom mobile game was designed to elicit behaviors related to problem solving, planning, adaptability, persistence, time management, and information seeking. Fine-grained gameplay event data were collected and analyzed using a two-phase modeling strategy where suitability was predicted exclusively from gameplay-derived behavioral features. Results show that our model achieved up to 97% precision and 94% accuracy. Behavioral analysis revealed that proper candidates exhibited distinct gameplay patterns, such as more wins in puzzle-based games, more side challenges, navigating menus more frequently, and exhibiting fewer pauses, retries, and surrender actions. These findings demonstrate that implicit behavioral traces captured during gameplay is promising in predicting software-development suitability without explicit personality testing, supporting serious games as a scalable, engaging, and less biased alternative for career assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec

A critical challenge is cross-attack generalization: can detectors trained on known attack families recognize novel, unseen attack types? We discover that standard conversational tokenization -- capturing linguistic patterns from agent interactions -- fails catastrophically on structural attacks like tool hijacking (AUC 0.39) and data exfiltration (AUC 0.46), while succeeding on linguistic attacks like social engineering (AUC 0.78). We introduce structural tokenization, encoding execution-flow patterns (tool calls, arguments, observations) rather than conversational content. This simple representational change dramatically improves cross-attack generalization: +46 AUC points on tool hijacking, +39 points on data exfiltration, and +71 points on unknown attacks, while simultaneously improving in-distribution performance (+6 points). For attacks requiring linguistic features, we propose gated multi-view fusion that adaptively combines both representations, achieving AUC 0.89 on social engineering without sacrificing structural attack detection. Our findings reveal that AI agent security is fundamentally a structural problem: attack semantics reside in execution patterns, not surface language. While our rule-based tokenizer serves as a baseline, the structural abstraction principle generalizes even with simple implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4

Static benchmarks measure knowledge breadth but fail to quantify the depth of belief. While Simhi et al. (2025) defined the CHOKE phenomenon in standard QA, we extend this framework to quantify \"Cognitive Conviction\" in System 2 reasoning models. We propose Project Aletheia, a cognitive physics framework that employs Tikhonov Regularization to invert the judge's confusion matrix. To validate this methodology without relying on opaque private data, we implement a Synthetic Proxy Protocol. Our preliminary pilot study on 2025 baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1) suggests that while reasoning models act as a \"cognitive buffer,\" they may exhibit \"Defensive OverThinking\" under adversarial pressure. Furthermore, we introduce the Aligned Conviction Score (S_aligned) to verify that conviction does not compromise safety.

Traditional digital divide frameworks fail to explain these variations.\n  Purpose: This study introduces the \"Dependency Divide\", a novel framework proposing that highly engaged students become conditionally vulnerable to infrastructure failures, challenging assumptions that engagement uniformly benefits learners in post-access environments.\n  Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 396 university students in Bangladesh using a three-stage analytical approach: (1) stability-validated K-prototypes clustering to identify student profiles, (2) profile-specific Random Forest models with SHAP and ALE analysis to determine satisfaction drivers, and (3) formal interaction analysis with propensity score matching to test the Dependency Divide hypothesis.\n  Results: Three distinct profiles emerged: Casually Engaged (58%), Efficient Learners (35%), and Hyper-Engaged (7%). A significant interaction between educational device time and internet reliability (\\b{eta} = 0.033, p = 0.028) confirmed the Dependency Divide: engagement increased satisfaction only when infrastructure remained reliable. Hyper-Engaged students showed greatest vulnerability despite or because of their sophisticated digital workflows. Policy simulations demonstrated that targeted reliability improvements for high-dependency users yielded 2.06 times greater returns than uniform interventions.\n  Conclusions: In fragile infrastructure contexts, capability can become liability. Digital transformation policies must prioritize reliability for dependency-prone users, establish contingency systems, and educate students about dependency risks rather than uniformly promoting

Traditional approaches rely on procedural JSON-based function calling, which often struggles with long-horizon tasks due to fragile multi-turn dependencies and context drift. In this paper, we present CaveAgent, a framework that transforms the paradigm from \"LLM-as-Text-Generator\" to \"LLM-as-Runtime-Operator.\" We introduce a Dual-stream Context Architecture that decouples state management into a lightweight semantic stream for reasoning and a persistent, deterministic Python Runtime stream for execution. In addition to leveraging code generation to efficiently resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, we introduce \\textit{Stateful Runtime Management} in CaveAgent. Distinct from existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound and lack the support for external object injection and retrieval, CaveAgent injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns. This persistence mechanism acts as a high-fidelity external memory to eliminate context drift, avoid catastrophic forgetting, while ensuring that processed data flows losslessly to downstream applications. Comprehensive evaluations on Tau$^2$-bench, BFCL and various case studies across representative SOTA LLMs demonstrate CaveAgent's superiority. Specifically, our framework achieves a 10.5\\% success rate improvement on retail tasks and reduces total token consumption by 28.4\\% in multi-turn scenarios. On data-intensive tasks, direct variable storage and retrieval reduces token consumption by 59\\%, allowing CaveAgent to handle large-scale data that causes context overflow failures in both JSON-based and Code-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "CaveAgent\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc911\uc2ec \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744

This survey synthesizes the emerging landscape of AI agent architectures across: (i) deliberation and reasoning (e.g., chain-of-thought-style decomposition, self-reflection and verification, and constraint-aware decision making), (ii) planning and control (from reactive policies to hierarchical and multi-step planners), and (iii) tool calling and environment interaction (retrieval, code execution, APIs, and multimodal perception).

However, current methods remain impeded by drug data scarcity-induced cold-start challenge, closed label sets, and inadequate modeling of label dependencies. Here we propose an open-ended ADR prediction paradigm based on Graph-Motif feature fusion and Multi-Label Generation (GM-MLG). Leveraging molecular structure as an intrinsic and inherent feature, GM-MLG constructs a dual-graph representation architecture spanning the atomic level, the local molecular level (utilizing fine-grained motifs dynamically extracted via the BRICS algorithm combined with additional fragmentation rules), and the global molecular level. Uniquely, GM-MLG pioneers transforming ADR prediction from multi-label classification into Transformer Decoder-based multi-label generation. By treating ADR labels as discrete token sequences, it employs positional embeddings to explicitly capture dependencies and co-occurrence relationships within large-scale label spaces, generating predictions via autoregressive decoding to dynamically expand the prediction space. Experiments demonstrate GM-MLG achieves up to 38% improvement and an average gain of 20%, expanding the prediction space from 200 to over 10,000 types. Furthermore, it elucidates non-linear structure-activity relationships between ADRs and motifs via retrosynthetic motif analysis, providing interpretable and innovative support for systematic risk reduction in drug safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 ADR \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud655\ub300\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc57d\ubb3c \ubd80\uc791\uc6a9(ADR) \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\uc57d \uac1c\ubc1c \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uae30\uac04\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83.", "method": "Graph-Motif \ud2b9\uc131 \uc735\ud569\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 ADR \uc608\uce21 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784(GM-MLG)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud568.", "result": "GM-MLG\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 200\uac1c\uc5d0\uc11c 10,000\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 38%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \ud3c9\uade0 20%\uc758 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 ADR\uacfc \ubaa8\ud2f0\ud504 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uad6c\uc870-\ud65c\uc131 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uc57d\ubb3c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uacc4\uc0b0 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc740 \uc57d\ubb3c \ubd80\uc791\uc6a9(ADR) \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\uc57d \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uae34 \uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \ub2e8\ucd95\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud070 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc57d\ubb3c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ucf5c\ub4dc \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8 \ubb38\uc81c, \ub2eb\ud78c \ub77c\ubca8 \uc138\ud2b8, \ub77c\ubca8 \uc885\uc18d\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \ubd80\uc801\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504-\ubaa8\ud2f0\ud504 \ud2b9\uc131 \uc735\ud569\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 ADR \uc608\uce21 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784(GM-MLG)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing approaches often rely on structured inputs and lack robust validation of factual accuracy and semantic consistency, limitations that are especially problematic in oncology. We introduce an end-to-end framework for clinical KG construction and evaluation directly from free text using multi-agent prompting and a schema-constrained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) strategy. Our pipeline integrates (1) prompt-driven entity, attribute, and relation extraction; (2) entropy-based uncertainty scoring; (3) ontology-aligned RDF/OWL schema generation; and (4) multi-LLM consensus validation for hallucination detection and semantic refinement. Beyond static graph construction, the framework supports continuous refinement and self-supervised evaluation, enabling iterative improvement of graph quality. Applied to two oncology cohorts (PDAC and BRCA), our method produces interpretable, SPARQL-compatible, and clinically grounded knowledge graphs without relying on gold-standard annotations.

Here, practical AI assistance requires the seamless integration of domain literature knowledge with robust execution capabilities for expertise-intensive tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlamePilot, an LLM agent designed to empower combustion modeling research through automated and self-corrective CFD workflows. FlamePilot differentiates itself through an architecture that leverages atomic tools to ensure the robust setup and execution of complex simulations in both OpenFOAM and extended frameworks such as DeepFlame. The system is also capable of learning from scientific articles, extracting key information to guide the simulation from initial setup to optimized results. Validation on a public benchmark shows FlamePilot achieved a perfect 1.0 executability score and a 0.438 success rate, surpassing the prior best reported agent scores of 0.625 and 0.250, respectively. Furthermore, a detailed case study on Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion simulation demonstrates its efficacy as a collaborative research copilot, where FlamePilot autonomously translated a research paper into a configured simulation, conducted the simulation, post-processed the results, proposed evidence-based refinements, and managed a multi-step parameter study to convergence under minimal human intervention. By adopting a transparent and interpretable paradigm, FlamePilot establishes a foundational framework for AI-empowered combustion modeling, fostering a collaborative partnership where the agent manages workflow orchestration, freeing the researcher for high-level analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlamePilot\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c CFD \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uc18c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uacfc\ud559 \ubb38\ud5cc \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 OpenFOAM\uacfc DeepFlame\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uc124\uc815\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uad6c \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uc18c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 AI \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "FlamePilot\uc740 OpenFOAM\uacfc DeepFlame\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6d0\uc790 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uacfc\ud559 \uae30\uc0ac\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \uc124\uc815\ubd80\ud130 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "result": "FlamePilot\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c 1.0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc810\uc218\uc640 0.438 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uace0\ub41c \ucd5c\uace0 \uc810\uc218\uc778 0.625\uc640 0.250\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FlamePilot\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\uac00 \uace0\uae09 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uc720\ub85c\uc6cc\uc9c0\ub3c4\ub85d \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud611\uc5c5 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\uc2ed\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 AI \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5f0\uc18c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uacf3\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 AI \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc740 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc720\uccb4 \uc5ed\ud559(CFD) \ucf54\ub4dc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ubb38 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7fd\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc790\uae30 \uc218\uc815\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c CFD \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uc18c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 FlamePilot\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Although prior studies have advanced the overall design of LLM-based agents, systematic optimization of their internal reasoning and tool-use pipelines remains underexplored. This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression. An end-to-end framework named Jenius-Agent has been integrated with three key optimizations, including tools based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), file input/output (I/O), and execution feedback.

These bounds are intrinsically data- and algorithm-dependent so that one can exploit the properties of data and algorithm to derive tighter bounds. However, we observe that although the flatness bias is crucial for SGD's generalization, these bounds fail to capture the improved generalization under better flatness and are also numerically loose. This is caused by the inadequate leverage of SGD's flatness bias in existing IT bounds. This paper derives a more flatness-leveraging IT bound for the flatness-favoring SGD. The bound indicates the learned models generalize better if the large-variance directions of the final weight covariance have small local curvatures in the loss landscape. Experiments on deep neural networks show our bound not only correctly reflects the better generalization when flatness is improved, but is also numerically much tighter. This is achieved by a flexible technique called \"omniscient trajectory\". When applied to Gradient Descent's minimax excess risk on convex-Lipschitz-Bounded problems, it improves representative IT bounds' $\u03a9(1)$ rates to $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$. It also implies a by-pass of memorization-generalization trade-offs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 SGD\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 SGD\uc758 \ud3c9\ud0c4\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, \ud3c9\ud0c4\ub3c4\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc758 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\ud3c9\ud0c4\ub3c4\ub97c \ub354\uc6b1 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc885 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0\uc758 \ud070 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc774 \uc190\uc2e4 \uacbd\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc740 \uad6d\uc18c \uace1\ub960\uc744 \uac00\uc9c8 \ub54c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uace0, \uc218\uce58\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ub354 \ud0c0\uc774\ud2b8\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 SGD\uc758 \ud3c9\ud0c4\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ud654-\uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac04\uc758 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801(IT) \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c \ub354 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud3c9\ud0c4\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 SGD\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c\ub370\ub3c4 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \ud3c9\ud0c4\ub3c4\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ub420 \ub54c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uce58\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ub290\uc2a8\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 IT \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c SGD\uc758 \ud3c9\ud0c4\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud3c9\ud0c4\ub3c4\ub97c \uc120\ud638\ud558\ub294 SGD\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud3c9\ud0c4\ub3c4 \ud65c\uc6a9 IT \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucd5c\uc885 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0\uc758 \ud070 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc774 \uc190\uc2e4 \uacbd\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc740 \uad6d\uc18c \uace1\ub960\uc744 \uac00\uc9c8 \ub54c \ub354 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2ec\uce35 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \ud3c9\ud0c4\ub3c4\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ub420 \ub54c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc62c\ubc14\ub974\uac8c \ubc18\uc601\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc218\uce58\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ud0c0\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc740 '\uc804\uc9c0\uc801 \uada4\uc801(omniscient trajectory)'\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2ec\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc774 \ubcfc\ub85d-\ub9bd\uc2dc\uce20-\uacbd\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud558\uac15\uc758 minimax \ucd08\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \ub54c, \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 IT \uacbd\uacc4\uc758 $\u03a9(1)$ \ube44\uc728\uc744 $O(1/\radical{n})$\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ud654-\uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac04\uc758 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Vision-language models can produce natural language explanations, but these are often correlational and lack verifiable evidence. In this paper, we introduce an SQL-centered agentic framework that enables both feature measurement and reasoning to be auditable. Specifically, after extracting human-interpretable cellular features, Feature Reasoning Agents compose and execute SQL queries over feature tables to aggregate visual evidence into quantitative findings. A Knowledge Comparison Agent then evaluates these findings against established pathological knowledge, mirroring how pathologists justify diagnoses from measurable observations.

While KD has shown strong empirical success in numerous applications, its theoretical underpinnings remain only partially understood. In this work, we adopt a Bayesian perspective on KD to rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of students trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We study two regimes: $(i)$ when the teacher provides the exact Bayes Class Probabilities (BCPs); and $(ii)$ supervision with noisy approximations of the BCPs. Our analysis shows that learning from BCPs yields variance reduction and removes neighborhood terms in the convergence bounds compared to one-hot supervision. We further characterize how the level of noise affects generalization and accuracy. Motivated by these insights, we advocate the use of Bayesian deep learning models, which typically provide improved estimates of the BCPs, as teachers in KD. Consistent with our analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that students distilled from Bayesian teachers not only achieve higher accuracies (up to +4.27%), but also exhibit more stable convergence (up to 30% less noise), compared to students distilled from deterministic teachers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958(KD)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubca0\uc774esian \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uac70\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354\uc6b1 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "KD\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uad50\uc0ac \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc804\uc774\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc2ec \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub9cc \uc774\ud574\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad50\uc0ac\uac00 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubca0\uc774\uc988 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ud655\ub960(BCP)\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \ub54c\uc640 BCP\uc758 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc720\uc0ac\ubb3c\ub85c \uac10\ub3c5\ud560 \ub54c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6c\uac04\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "BCP\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc218\ub834 \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc6c3 \ud56d\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uba70, \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubca0\uc774esian \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 KD\uc5d0\uc11c \uad50\uc0ac\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ubca0\uc774esian \uad50\uc0ac\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc99d\ub958\ub41c \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958(KD)\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uad50\uc0ac \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc804\uc774\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc2ec \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing methods typically assume full client availability, which is rarely practical. In real-world FL systems, clients often participate in a cyclic manner: joining training according to a fixed, repeating schedule. This setting poses unique optimization challenges for the non-decomposable AUC objective. This paper addresses these challenges by developing and analyzing communication-efficient algorithms for federated AUC maximization under cyclic client participation. We investigate two key settings: First, we study AUC maximization with a squared surrogate loss, which reformulates the problem as a nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. By leveraging the Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz (PL) condition, we establish a state-of-the-art communication complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\u03b5^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\u03b5)$. Second, we consider general pairwise AUC losses. We establish a communication complexity of $O(1/\u03b5^3)$ and an iteration complexity of $O(1/\u03b5^4)$. Further, under the PL condition, these bounds improve to communication complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\u03b5^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\u03b5)$. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks in image classification, medical imaging, and fraud detection demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc8fc\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc5ec \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\ud569 AUC \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 AUC \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uc804\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc8fc\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc5f0\ud569 AUC \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, AUC \uadf9\ub300\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ube44convex-\uac15\ud55c \uc624\ubaa9 \ucd5c\uc18c \uadf9\ub300\ud654 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c $\tilde{O}(1/\u03b5^{1/2})$\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 $O(1/\u03b5^3)$\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958, \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub4f1\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 AUC \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \ub4dc\ubb45\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c FL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uace0\uc815\ub418\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\uc815\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uad50\uc721\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc740 \ubd84\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 AUC \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc8fc\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc5ec \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\ud569 AUC \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uacf1 \ub300\uccb4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c AUC \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ube44convex-\uac15\ud55c \uc624\ubaa9 \ucd5c\uc18c \uadf9\ub300\ud654 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Chaotic dynamical systems provide an especially demanding test because chaos is deterministic yet often misinterpreted as randomness or complexity. We introduce ChaosBench-Logic, a benchmark that evaluates LLM reasoning across 30 diverse dynamical systems using a unified first-order logic (FOL) ontology. Each system is annotated with truth assignments for 11 semantic predicates, and 621 questions are generated across seven reasoning categories, including multi-hop implications, cross-system analogies, counterfactual reasoning, bias probes, and multi-turn dialogues. We define metrics for logical accuracy, implication consistency, dialogue coherence, and contradiction, and we release an open-source evaluation pipeline. Initial experiments show that frontier LLMs such as GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and the open-source LLaMA-3 70B achieve 91-94% per-item accuracy, yet still score 0% on compositional items and exhibit fragile global coherence. Dialogue-level accuracy ranges from 53.1% (GPT-4 CoT) to 75.5% (LLaMA-3 zero-shot).

Code available at https://github.com/mlbio-epfl/HeurekaBench", "summary": "LLM-based reasoning models have enabled the development of agentic systems that act as co-scientists, assisting in multi-step scientific analysis. However, evaluating these systems is challenging, as it requires realistic, end-to-end research scenarios that integrate data analysis, interpretation, and the generation of new insights from the experimental data. To address this limitation, we introduce HeurekaBench, a framework to create benchmarks with exploratory, open-ended research questions for experimental datasets. Each such question is grounded in a scientific study and its corresponding code repository, and is created using a semi-automated pipeline that leverages multiple LLMs to extract insights and generate candidate workflows, which are then verified against reported findings. We instantiate the framework in single-cell biology to obtain sc-HeurekaBench benchmark and use it to compare state-of-the-art single-cell agents. We further showcase the benefits of our benchmark for quantitatively analyzing current design choices in agentic systems. We find that the addition of a critic module can improve ill-formed responses for open-source LLM-based agents by up to 22% and close the gap with their closed-source counterparts. Overall, HeurekaBench sets a path toward rigorous, end-to-end evaluation of scientific agents, grounding benchmark construction in real scientific workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "HeurekaBench\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "HeurekaBench \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uc790\ub3d9 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uac01 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "sc-HeurekaBench \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc2e0\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc138\ud3ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc728 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\ud3c9 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c ill-formed \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 22% \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HeurekaBench\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\ub85c\uc11c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d, \ud574\uc11d \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 HeurekaBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ud574\ub2f9 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uc790\ub3d9 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uc138\ud3ec \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec sc-HeurekaBench \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc5bb\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ub2e8\uc138\ud3ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\ud3c9 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uba74 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 ill-formed \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 22% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ud074\ub85c\uc988\ub4dc \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c HeurekaBench\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud574 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this article, we present MindChat, a privacy-preserving LLM for mental health support, together with MindCorpus, a synthetic multi-turn counseling dataset constructed via a multi-agent role-playing framework. To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks. Experiments on synthetic-data quality assessment and counseling capability evaluation show that MindCorpus improves training effectiveness and that MindChat is competitive with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines under both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluation protocols, while exhibiting reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MindChat)\uacfc \ud569\u6210 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud68c\ucc28 \uc0c1\ub2f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(MindCorpus)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\ub098, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ub2f4 \ub300\ud654\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc131\uacfc \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5ed\ud560\uadf9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\uc131 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud68c\ucc28 \uc0c1\ub2f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc0c1\ub2f4 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc0c1\ub2f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MindCorpus\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, MindChat\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ub2f4 \uc9c0\ud5a5 LLM\uacfc\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MindChat\uc740 \ud68c\uc6d0 \ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ub2f4 \ub300\ud654\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uad50\uc721\uc774 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae30\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \uc9c0\uc6d0 LLM\uc778 MindChat\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5ed\ud560\uadf9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud68c\ucc28 \uc0c1\ub2f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc778 MindCorpus\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc0c1\ub2f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \ub300\ud654 \uad6c\ucd95 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560\uadf9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc0c1\ub2f4 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \uc138\uc158 \ub0b4 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ub2f4 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud134 \uc218\uc900 \ube44\ud310 \ubc0f \uc218\uc815, (ii) \uc138\uc158 \uac04 \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc790\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc138\uc158 \uc218\uc900 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac1c\uc120. \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc720 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 LoRA \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ud68c\uc6d0 \ubc0f \uae30\uc5b5 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud488\uc9c8 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ub2f4 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 MindCorpus\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, MindChat\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9 LLM \ud310\ub2e8\uc790 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ub2f4 \uc9c0\ud5a5 LLM \uae30\uc900\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \ud68c\uc6d0 \ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

As a primary countermeasure, adversarial training improves policy robustness by training the AD agent in the presence of an adversary that deliberately introduces perturbations. Existing approaches typically model the interaction as a zero-sum game with continuous attacks. However, such designs overlook the inherent asymmetry between the agent and the adversary and then fail to reflect the sparsity of safety-critical risks, rendering the achieved robustness inadequate for practical AD scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce criticality-aware robust RL (CARRL), a novel adversarial training approach for handling sparse, safety-critical risks in autonomous driving. CARRL consists of two interacting components: a risk exposure adversary (REA) and a risk-targeted robust agent (RTRA). We model the interaction between the REA and RTRA as a general-sum game, allowing the REA to focus on exposing safety-critical failures (e.g., collisions) while the RTRA learns to balance safety with driving efficiency. The REA employs a decoupled optimization mechanism to better identify and exploit sparse safety-critical moments under a constrained budget. However, such focused attacks inevitably result in a scarcity of adversarial data. The RTRA copes with this scarcity by jointly leveraging benign and adversarial experiences via a dual replay buffer and enforces policy consistency under perturbations to stabilize behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the collision rate by at least 22.66\\% across all cases compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "CARRL\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub454 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud55c \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "CARRL\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CARRL\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \ub178\ucd9c \uc801\ub300\uc790(REA)\uc640 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud0c0\uac9f \uac15\uac74 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(RTRA)\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18 \ud569\uacc4 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc900 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \ucda9\ub3cc\ub960\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c 22.66% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CARRL\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589(AD)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ub300\uc751\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc758\ub3c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\ub780\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc790\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c AD \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uc18d \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc801\ub300\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \ub2ec\uc131\ub41c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c AD \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 \ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f0\uceec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc778\uc2dd \uac15\uac74 RL(CARRL)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(\u03b8)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $\u03b8$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(\u03b8)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(\u03b8)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(\u03b8)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(\u03b8)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654

We systematically investigate action smoothness regularization through higher-order derivative penalties, progressing from theoretical understanding in continuous control benchmarks to practical validation in building energy management. Our comprehensive evaluation across four continuous control environments demonstrates that third-order derivative penalties (jerk minimization) consistently achieve superior smoothness while maintaining competitive performance. We extend these findings to HVAC control systems where smooth policies reduce equipment switching by 60%, translating to significant operational benefits. Our work establishes higher-order action regularization as an effective bridge between RL optimization and operational constraints in energy-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\uc640 \uae30\uacc4 \ub9c8\ubaa8\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0\uc790 \ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "\uace0\ucc28 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ub3d9\uc791 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6c0 \uaddc\uc81c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\uace0, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc885\ud569 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ucc28 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\uac00 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6c0\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0-\uc911\uc694 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c RL \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc81c\uc57d \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\ub9ac\ub85c\uc11c \uace0\ucc28 \ub3d9\uc791 \uaddc\uc81c\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c\uc218\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\uc640 \uae30\uacc4 \ub9c8\ubaa8\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc7a5\uc560\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\ucc28 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6c0 \uaddc\uc81c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \uac74\ubb3c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac \uac80\uc99d\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac04\ub2e4. \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc885\ud569 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc138 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ucc28 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0(\uc794 \uc9c4\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654)\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6c0\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c HVAC \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uc7a5\ube44 \uc804\ud658\uc744 60% \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc628\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0-\uc911\uc694 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c RL \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc81c\uc57d \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uacb0\uace0\ub9ac\ub85c\uc11c \uace0\ucc28 \ud589\ub3d9 \uaddc\uc81c\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, existing methods aggregate predictions from all clients to form a global teacher. Under non-IID data, conflicting predictions cancel out during averaging, yielding near-uniform soft labels that provide weak supervision for distillation. We propose FedBiCross, a personalized OSFL framework with three stages: (1) clustering clients by model output similarity to form coherent sub-ensembles, (2) bi-level cross-cluster optimization that learns adaptive weights to selectively leverage beneficial cross-cluster knowledge while suppressing negative transfer, and (3) personalized distillation for client-specific adaptation. Experiments on four medical image datasets demonstrate that FedBiCross consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across different non-IID degrees.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedBiCross\ub294 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "OSFL \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "FedBiCross\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc911 \uc218\uc900 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\uc815\uc801 \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FedBiCross\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc815\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FedBiCross\ub294 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc6d0\uc0f7 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(OSFL)\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec, \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uad50\uc0ac\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294\ub370, \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ubc0f \uc2dd\ubcc4\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\ucda9\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\uc1c4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc57d\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub77c\ubca8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 FedBiCross\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c OSFL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4: (1) \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud558\uc704 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \ud615\uc131, (2) \uc720\uc775\ud55c \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ubd80\uc815\uc801 \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc218\uc900 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654, (3) \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc99d\ub958. \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, FedBiCross\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Existing memory systems often store isolated records and retrieve fragments, limiting their ability to consolidate evolving user states and resolve conflicts. We introduce EverMemOS, a self-organizing memory operating system that implements an engram-inspired lifecycle for computational memory. Episodic Trace Formation converts dialogue streams into MemCells that capture episodic traces, atomic facts, and time-bounded Foresight signals. Semantic Consolidation organizes MemCells into thematic MemScenes, distilling stable semantic structures and updating user profiles. Reconstructive Recollection performs MemScene-guided agentic retrieval to compose the necessary and sufficient context for downstream reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval show that EverMemOS achieves state-of-the-art performance on memory-augmented reasoning tasks. We further report a profile study on PersonaMem v2 and qualitative case studies illustrating chat-oriented capabilities such as user profiling and Foresight.

SynRXN decomposes end-to-end synthesis planning into five task families, covering reaction rebalancing, atom-to-atom mapping, reaction classification, reaction property prediction, and synthesis route design. Curated, provenance-tracked reaction corpora are assembled from heterogeneous public sources into a harmonized representation and packaged as versioned datasets for each task family, with explicit source metadata, licence tags, and machine-readable manifests that record checksums, and row counts. For every task, SynRXN provides transparent splitting functions that generate leakage-aware train, validation, and test partitions, together with standardized evaluation workflows and metric suites tailored to classification, regression, and structured prediction settings. For sensitive benchmarking, we combine public training and validation data with held-out gold-standard test sets, and contamination-prone tasks such as reaction rebalancing and atom-to-atom mapping are distributed only as evaluation sets and are explicitly not intended for model training. Scripted build recipes enable bitwise-reproducible regeneration of all corpora across machines and over time, and the entire resource is released under permissive open licences to support reuse and extension. By removing dataset heterogeneity and packaging transparent, reusable evaluation scaffolding, SynRXN enables fair longitudinal comparison of CASP methods, supports rigorous ablations and stress tests along the full reaction-informatics pipeline, and lowers the barrier for practitioners who seek robust and comparable performance estimates for real-world synthesis planning workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynRXN\uc740 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud569\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d(CASP)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\uc790 \uc624\ud508 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud569\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uba70 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec CASP \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud569\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc138\ub300\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc138\ub300\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubc84\uc804\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud328\ud0a4\uc9d5\ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uac00 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SynRXN\uc740 \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud560 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SynRXN\uc740 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \ud569\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0, CASP \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud569\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d(CASP)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\uc790 \uc624\ud508 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc790\uc6d0\uc778 SynRXN\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While \\textit{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting allows agents to generate human-readable reasoning traces, it remains unclear whether these traces are \\textbf{faithful} generative drivers of the model's output or merely \\textbf{post-hoc rationalizations}. We introduce \\textbf{Project Ariadne}, a novel XAI framework that utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual logic to audit the causal integrity of agentic reasoning. Unlike existing interpretability methods that rely on surface-level textual similarity, Project Ariadne performs \\textbf{hard interventions} ($do$-calculus) on intermediate reasoning nodes -- systematically inverting logic, negating premises, and reversing factual claims -- to measure the \\textbf{Causal Sensitivity} ($\u03c6$) of the terminal answer. Our empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a persistent \\textit{Faithfulness Gap}. We define and detect a widespread failure mode termed \\textbf{Causal Decoupling}, where agents exhibit a violation density ($\u03c1$) of up to $0.77$ in factual and scientific domains. In these instances, agents arrive at identical conclusions despite contradictory internal logic, proving that their reasoning traces function as \"Reasoning Theater\" while decision-making is governed by latent parametric priors. Our findings suggest that current agentic architectures are inherently prone to unfaithful explanation, and we propose the Ariadne Score as a new benchmark for aligning stated logic with model action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8

In sharp contrast, on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) effectively preserves general capabilities. We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as \"Confident Conflicts\" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT)\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 SFT\uac00 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc758 \ud45c\uc900 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uc7ac\uc559\uc801\uc778 \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uc608\uce21 \ud655\ub960\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \uac8c\uc774\ud305 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "Qwen \ubc0f GLM \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c EAFT\uac00 \ud45c\uc900 SFT\uc758 \ud558\ud5a5\uc2dd \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EAFT\ub294 SFT\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ucda9\ub3cc\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac10\ub3c5 \uc138\ubd84\ud654(Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT)\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uc7ac\uc559\uc801\uc778 \ub9dd\uac01(catastrophic forgetting)\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(On-policy Reinforcement Learning, RL)\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec \uaca9\ucc28(distributional gap)\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: RL\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc2e0\ub150\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, SFT\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc678\ubd80 \uac10\ub3c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\ub3c4\ub85d \uac15\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub0ae\uc740 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 '\ud655\uc2e0\ud558\ub294 \uac08\ub4f1(Confident Conflicts)' \ud1a0\ud070\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0, \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud655\uc2e0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc9c4\uc2e4\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub3c4\ub85d \uac15\uc694\ubc1b\uc544 \ud30c\uad34\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc801\uc751 \uc138\ubd84\ud654(Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning, EAFT)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\\times$ to $7\\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling.

However, existing approaches for ACD, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), often face difficult exploration in complex networks with large decision/state spaces and thus require an expensive amount of samples. Inspired by the need to learn sample-efficient defense policies, we frame ACD in CAGE Challenge 4 (CAGE-4 / CC4) as a context-based partially observable Markov decision problem and propose a planning-centric defense policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It explicitly models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in ACD and uses statistical sampling to guide exploration and decision making. We make novel use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to embed observations from the network as attributed graphs, to enable permutation-invariant reasoning over hosts and their relationships. To make our solution practical in complex search spaces, we guide MCTS with learned graph embeddings and priors over graph-edit actions, combining model-free generalization and policy distillation with look-ahead planning. We evaluate the resulting agent on CC4 scenarios involving diverse network structures and adversary behaviors, and show that our search-guided, graph-embedding-based planning improves defense reward and robustness relative to state-of-the-art RL baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc29\uc5b4(ACD)\ub97c \uc704\ud574

However, mainstream training paradigms face key challenges: Behavior Cloning is simple and effective through imitation but suffers from low behavioral diversity, while Reinforcement Learning is capable of discovering novel strategies through exploration but heavily relies on manually designed reward functions. To address the conflict between these two methods, we present CORE, a Code-based Inverse Self-Training Framework with Graph Expansion that bridges imitation and exploration, offering a novel training framework that promotes behavioral diversity while eliminating the reliance on manually reward design. Specifically, we introduce Semantic Code Abstraction to automatically infers reward functions from expert demonstrations without manual design. The inferred reward function, referred to as the Label Function, is executable code that verifies one key step within a task. Building on this, we propose Strategy Graph Expansion to enhance in-domain behavioral diversity, which constructs a multi-path graph called Strategy Graph that captures diverse valid solutions beyond expert demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Extrapolation, which enriches out-of-domain behavioral diversity by utilizing both successful and failed trajectories to expand the task space. Experiments on Web and Android platforms demonstrate that CORE significantly improves both overall performance and generalization, highlighting its potential as a robust and generalizable training
