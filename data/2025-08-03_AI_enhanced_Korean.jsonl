However, most existing research still\nstruggles to address the challenges posed by environments where multiple\nvehicles have to interact seamlessly. This study aims to integrate causal\nlearning with reinforcement learning-based methods by leveraging causal\ndisentanglement representation learning (CDRL) to identify and extract causal\nfeatures that influence optimal decision-making in autonomous vehicles. These\nfeatures are then incorporated into graph neural network-based reinforcement\nlearning algorithms to enhance decision-making in complex traffic scenarios. By\nusing causal features as inputs, the proposed approach enables the optimization\nof vehicle behavior at an unsignalized intersection. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method achieves the highest average reward during\ntraining and our approach significantly outperforms other learning-based\nmethods in several key metrics such as collision rate and average cumulative\nreward during testing.

Existing privacy attacks on RAG systems can trigger\ndata leakage but often fail to accurately isolate knowledge-base-derived\nsentences within mixed responses. They also lack robustness when applied across\nmultiple domains. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel\nblack-box attack framework that exploits knowledge asymmetry between RAG and\nstandard LLMs to achieve fine-grained privacy extraction across heterogeneous\nknowledge landscapes. We propose a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy that\ncreates adaptive prompts to steer RAG systems away from sensitive content.\nSpecifically, we first decompose adversarial queries to maximize information\ndisparity and then apply a semantic relationship scoring to resolve lexical and\nsyntactic ambiguities. We finally train a neural network on these feature\nscores to precisely identify sentences containing private information. Unlike\nprior work, our framework generalizes to unseen domains through iterative\nrefinement without pre-defined knowledge. Experimental results show that we\nachieve over 91% privacy extraction rate in single-domain and 83% in\nmulti-domain scenarios, reducing sensitive sentence exposure by over 65% in\ncase studies.

The ability to predict the future structural\nevolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable\ninsights into aging trajectories.

The situation is\nevolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the\nintelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours.

In our experiments, we utilize\nmeteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United\nStates (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our\nframework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,\nfrost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.\nThe framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a\nrecurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal\nexplanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but\nprecisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive\naccuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's\ncapacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies.

Weight and activation quantization\n(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and\narithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ\ndesigns. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization\nfor hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform\nquantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like\ndistributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform\nnature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring\ndequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during\ninference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.\nOffline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant\nmodel performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques\nintroduce substantial runtime overhead.\n  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of\nWAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose\nKLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based\ncomputation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations\non K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and\nfull-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier\ndetection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and\nsmallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.\n  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,\n7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the\nA100 GPU and Atom, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "KLLM\uc740 LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c K-Means \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubc0f \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \uc800\ud558 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4-\uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub192\uc544, WAQ\uac00 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "KLLM\uc740 K-Means \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub82c \uacf1\uc148\uacfc \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\ub371\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uc911 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 Orizuru\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "KLLM\uc740 A100 GPU\uc640 Atom\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac01\uac01 \ud3c9\uade0 9.67\ubc30, 7.03\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc 229.50\ubc30, 150.21\ubc30\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KLLM\uc740 WAQ\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4."}}

Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across\nthe diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world\napplications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are\ntrained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.\nMeanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are\nfragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance\ncomputing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,\nwe present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a\ntransformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of\nmaterials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and\ntungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured\nand unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of\ntextual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and\nsolver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation\nacross simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture.

Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has\nemerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of\nindividual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,\nthis approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the\nnecessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training\nsamples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and\nscenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the\ndifficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that\nmemorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link\nbetween memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This\nconnection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of\nincremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in\nunlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on\nmore efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned\ncognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence\nApproximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from\nthe incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nIAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,\nand comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods\nacross diverse datasets and model architectures.

In this work, we investigate the function\nof process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We\npropose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism\noperating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based\ntraining. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve\nproblems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise\ncorrectness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent\n'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable\ncredit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating\nreward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism\nthat dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's\ncurrent proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative\ntrial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL\nalgorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with\nprocess-based rewards and improves training efficiency.

Multivariate curve resolution\n(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base\npatterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in\nunderstanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix\nfactorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually\nunknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the\nscalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This\nstudy reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an\nenergy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the\nsmallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts\nfrom a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable\ngating network to retain only active components while estimating their\nconcentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent\nsources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count\nwithin 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near\nexact component estimation.

However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the\nquadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the\nsequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and\nsimilar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of\nsoftmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from\nthe original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream\naccuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and\nkey inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other\nnonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains\nunanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of\nsoftmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention.

AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and\ntime when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data\nneeded. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,\naiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.\nMost strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that\naffect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.\nThis work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only\nconsidering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue\nlevels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a\nKnowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available\nannotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using\ntheir past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as\ninformation about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing\nliterature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating\nannotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.\nThe results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and\nfatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,\nand the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not\nusing internal factors.
