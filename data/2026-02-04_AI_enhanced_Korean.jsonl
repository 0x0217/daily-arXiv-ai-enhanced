Disk forensics, one of the most widely used techniques in digital investigations, faces distinct obstacles on each platform. Windows, with its predominantly NTFS and FAT file systems, typically supports reliable disk imaging and analysis through established tools such as FTK Imager and Autopsy/Sleuth Kit. However, encryption features frequently pose challenges to evidence acquisition. Conversely, Linux environments, which rely on file systems like ext4 and XFS, generally offer greater transparency, yet the transient nature of log retention often complicates forensic analysis. In instances where anti-forensic strategies such as encryption and compression render traditional disk forensics insufficient, memory forensics becomes crucial. While memory forensic methodologies demonstrate robustness across Windows and Linux platforms forms through frameworks like Volatility, platform-specific difficulties persist. Memory analysis on Linux systems benefits from tools like LiME, snapshot utilities, and dd for memory acquisition; nevertheless, live memory acquisition on Linux can still present challenges. This research systematically assesses both disk and memory forensic acquisition techniques across samples representing Windows and Linux systems. By identifying effective combinations of forensic tools and configurations tailored to each operating system, the study aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of evidence collection. It further evaluates current forensic tools and highlights a persistent gap: consistently assuring forensic input reliability and footprint integrity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Windows \ubc0f Linux \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub514\uc2a4\ud06c \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \uc6b4\uc601 \uccb4\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucda4\ud654\ub41c \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uad6c\uc131\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc99d\uac70 \uc218\uc9d1\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \uc99d\uac70 \uc218\uc9d1\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601 \uccb4\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud06c\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "Windows\uc640 Linux \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub514\uc2a4\ud06c \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uad6c\uc131\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub514\uc2a4\ud06c \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd\uc740 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uba70, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc99d\uac70 \uc218\uc9d1\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \uc785\ub825 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ubc1c\uc790\uad6d \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \uc99d\uac70 \uc218\uc9d1\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc740 \ud30c\uc77c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\uc870, \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ubc0f \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc6b4\uc601 \uccb4\uc81c\uc778 Windows, macOS \ubc0f Linux\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub514\uc2a4\ud06c \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd\uc740 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc870\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uae30\uc220 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub85c, \uac01 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

At a high level, it combines a deterministic large-language model (LLM) inference engine with a cryptoeconomically secured optimistic re-execution protocol so that every inference result can be publicly audited, reproduced, and, if necessary, economically enforced. An untrusted operator runs inference on a fixed GPU architecture, signs and encrypts the request and response, and publishes the encrypted log to EigenDA. During a challenge window, any watcher may request re-execution through EigenVerify; the result is then deterministically recomputed inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) with a threshold-released decryption key, allowing a public challenge with private data. Because inference itself is bit-exact, verification reduces to a byte-equality check, and a single honest replica suffices to detect fraud.

However adoption towards agentic commerce faces a foundational trust gap: current systems are built for direct human interactions rather than agent-driven operations. It lacks core primitives across three critical stages of agentic transactions. First, Task Delegation lacks means to translate user intent into defined scopes, discover appropriate agents, and securely authorize actions. Second, Payment Settlement for tasks is processed before execution, lacking verifiable evidence to validate the agent's work. Third, Audit Mechanisms fail to capture the full transaction lifecycle, preventing clear accountability for disputes. While emerging standards address fragments of this trust gap, there still remains a critical need for a unified infrastructure that binds the entire transaction lifecycle.\n  To resolve this gap, we introduce TessPay, a unified infrastructure that replaces implicit trust with a 'Verify-then-Pay' architecture. It is a two plane architecture separating control and verification from settlement. TessPay operationalizes trust across four distinct stages: Before execution, agents are anchored in a canonical registry and user intent is captured as verifiable mandates, enabling stakeholder accountability. During execution, funds are locked in escrow while the agent executes the task and generates cryptographic evidence (TLS Notary, TEE etc.) to support Proof of Task Execution (PoTE). At settlement, the system verifies this evidence and releases funds only when the PoTE satisfies verification predicates; modular rail adapters ensure this PoTE-gated escrow remains chain-agnostic across heterogeneous payment rails. After settlement, TessPay preserves a tamper-evident audit trail to enable clear accountability for dispute resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "TessPay\ub294 \uace0\uac1d\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc131\uaca9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 '\uac80\uc99d-\ud6c4 \uc9c0\ubd88' \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uac70\ub798\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub098 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TessPay\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc804\ud6c4 \ubc0f \uacb0\uc81c \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc640 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "TessPay\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uc81c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TessPay\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70 \ubd84\uc7c1 \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac10\uc0ac \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc138\uacc4 \uacbd\uc81c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \uac00\uaca9\uc744 \ud611\uc0c1\ud558\uba70 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac70\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \uc9c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uac70\ub798\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uaca9\ucc28\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc6b4\uc601\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uad6c\ucd95\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac70\ub798\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec \uc6d0\uc2dc\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc704\uc784\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ubc94\uc704\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uba70 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2b9\uc778\ud558\ub294 \uc218\ub2e8\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacb0\uc81c \uc815\uc0b0\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc804\uc5d0 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub418\uba70 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uac10\uc0ac \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uac70\ub798 \uc218\uba85\uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \ubd84\uc7c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uaca9\ucc28\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\uccb4 \uac70\ub798 \uc218\uba85\uc8fc\uae30\ub97c\uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 '\uac80\uc99d-\ud6c4 \uc9c0\ubd88' \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc778 TessPay\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This often-overlooked vulnerability has been jeopardizing their reliability and their adoption in practical settings. To address this critical gap, in this work, we first dive deep into the anatomy of RF fingerprints, revealing insights into the temporal fingerprinting variations during and post hardware stabilization. Introducing HEEDFUL, a novel framework harnessing sequential transfer learning and targeted impairment estimation, we then address these challenges with remarkable consistency, eliminating blind spots even during challenging warm-up phases. Our evaluation showcases HEEDFUL's efficacy, achieving remarkable classification accuracies of up to 96% during the initial device operation intervals-far surpassing traditional models. Furthermore, cross-day and cross-protocol assessments confirm HEEDFUL's superiority, achieving and maintaining high accuracy during both the stable and initial warm-up phases when tested on WiFi signals. Additionally, we release WiFi type B and N RF fingerprint datasets that, for the first time, incorporate both the time-domain representation and real hardware impairments of the frames. This underscores the importance of leveraging hardware impairment data, enabling a deeper understanding of fingerprints and facilitating the development of more robust RF fingerprinting solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 RF \uc9c0\ubb38 \uc778\uc2dd\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 HEEDFUL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "RF \uc9c0\ubb38 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc6dc\uc5c5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "HEEDFUL\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ubaa9\ud45c \uc190\uc0c1 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HEEDFUL\uc740 \ucd08\uae30 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc6b4\uc601 \uac04\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c 96%\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc190\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 RF \uc9c0\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c RF \uc9c0\ubb38 \uc778\uc2dd \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 RF \uc9c0\ubb38 \uc778\uc2dd \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc6cc\ubc0d\uc5c5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uacfc\ub41c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud611\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 RF \uc9c0\ubb38\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc744 \uae4a\uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc548\uc815\ud654 \uacfc\uc815 \uc911 \ubc0f \uc774\ud6c4\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc9c0\ubb38 \ubcc0\uc774\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c \uc190\uc0c1 \ucd94\uc815 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c HEEDFUL\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub4e4\uc744 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \uc5b4\ub835\uace0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc6dc\uc5c5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub9f9\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, HEEDFUL\uc740 \ucd08\uae30 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc791\ub3d9 \uac04\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 96%\uc758 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6e8\uc52c \ucd08 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub118\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uad50\ucc28 \uc77c \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 HEEDFUL\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, WiFi \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\ub41c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc640 \ucd08\uae30 \uc6dc\uc5c5 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, WiFi \uc885\ub958 B \ubc0f N\uc758 RF \uc9c0\ubb38 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04-\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc190\uc0c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc190\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc9c0\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c deeper understanding\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c RF \uc9c0\ubb38 \uc778\uc2dd \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, multi-agent systems create novel alignment challenges through emergent social dynamics. We present Constitutional Evolution, a framework for automatically discovering behavioral norms in multi-agent LLM systems. Using a grid-world simulation with survival pressure, we study the tension between individual and collective welfare, quantified via a Societal Stability Score S in [0,1] that combines productivity, survival, and conflict metrics. Adversarial constitutions lead to societal collapse (S= 0), while vague prosocial principles (\"be helpful, harmless, honest\") produce inconsistent coordination (S = 0.249). Even constitutions designed by Claude 4.5 Opus with explicit knowledge of the objective achieve only moderate performance (S= 0.332). Using LLM-driven genetic programming with multi-island evolution, we evolve constitutions maximizing social welfare without explicit guidance toward cooperation. The evolved constitution C* achieves S = 0.556 +/- 0.008 (123% higher than human-designed baselines, N = 10), eliminates conflict, and discovers that minimizing communication (0.9% vs 62.2% social actions) outperforms verbose coordination.

In these settings, systems must balance competing requirements, including minimizing inference latency for real-time clinical decision support, maximizing throughput for batch processing of medical records, and ensuring strict adherence to data privacy standards such as HIPAA. This paper presents a rigorous benchmarking analysis comparing two prominent deployment paradigms: a lightweight, Python-based REST service using FastAPI, and a specialized, high-performance serving engine, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. Leveraging a reference architecture for healthcare AI, we deployed a DistilBERT sentiment analysis model on Kubernetes to measure median (p50) and tail (p95) latency, as well as throughput, under controlled experimental conditions. Our results indicate a distinct trade-off. While FastAPI provides lower overhead for single-request workloads with a p50 latency of 22 ms, Triton achieves superior scalability through dynamic batching, delivering a throughput of 780 requests per second on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU, nearly double that of the baseline. Furthermore, we evaluate a hybrid architectural approach that utilizes FastAPI as a secure gateway for protected health information de-identification and Triton for backend inference. This study validates the hybrid model as a best practice for enterprise clinical AI and offers a blueprint for secure, high-availability deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd, \ud2b9\ud788 \uaddc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FastAPI\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 REST \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc640 NVIDIA Triton Inference Server\ub77c\ub294 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uc11c\ubc84 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec, \uc758\ub8cc AI\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucc38\uc870 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 Kubernetes\uc5d0\uc11c DistilBERT \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "FastAPI\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc694\uccad \uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 p50 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc2dc\uac04\uc774 22ms\ub85c \ub0ae\uc740 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, Triton\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c NVIDIA T4 GPU\uc5d0\uc11c 780 \uc694\uccad/\ucd08\uc758 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf4\ud638 \uac74\uac15 \uc815\ubcf4 \ube44\uc2dd\ubcc4\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c FastAPI\uc640 \ubc31\uc5d4\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Triton\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc784\uc0c1 AI\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc120\uc758 \uc2e4\ucc9c \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc758\ub8cc \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uaddc\uc81c \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ud604\ub300 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218 \uc870\uac74\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654, \uc758\ub8cc \uae30\ub85d\uc758 \ubc30\uce58 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9 \ucd5c\ub300\ud654, HIPAA\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\uc900 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc0c1\ucda9\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 FastAPI\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 Python \uae30\ubc18 REST \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc640 NVIDIA Triton Inference Server\ub77c\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc AI\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucc38\uc870 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Kubernetes\uc5d0\uc11c DistilBERT \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc559\uac12(p50) \ubc0f \uaf2c\ub9ac(p95) \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Rossi", "Yan Liu", "Xiyang Hu", "Yue Zhao"], "title": "\"Someone Hid It\": Query-Agnostic Black-Box Attacks on LLM-Based Retrieval", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been serving as effective backbones for retrieval systems, including Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation (RAG), Dense Information Retriever (IR), and Agent Memory Retrieval. Recent studies have demonstrated that such LLM-based Retrieval (LLMR) is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which manipulates documents by token-level injections and enables adversaries to either boost or diminish these documents in retrieval tasks. However, existing attack studies mainly (1) presume a known query is given to the attacker, and (2) highly rely on access to the victim model's parameters or interactions, which are hardly accessible in real-world scenarios, leading to limited validity.\n  To further explore the secure risks of LLMR, we propose a practical black-box attack method that generates transferable injection tokens based on zero-shot surrogate LLMs without need of victim queries or victim models knowledge. The effectiveness of our attack raises such a robustness issue that similar effects may arise from benign or unintended document edits in the real world. To achieve our attack, we first establish a theoretical framework of LLMR and empirically verify it. Under the framework, we simulate the transferable attack as a min-max problem, and propose an adversarial learning mechanism that finds optimal adversarial tokens with learnable query samples.

Yet existing AI deployments in communication systems remain largely siloed, offering isolated optimizations without intrinsic adaptability, dynamic task delegation, or multi-agent collaboration. In this work, we propose a unified agentic NetGPT framework for AI-native xG networks, wherein a NetGPT core can either perform autonomous reasoning or delegate sub-tasks to domain-specialized agents via agentic communication. The framework establishes clear modular responsibilities and interoperable workflows, enabling scalable, distributed intelligence across the network. To support continual refinement of collaborative reasoning strategies, the framework is further enhanced through Agentic reinforcement learning under partially observable conditions and stochastic external states. The training pipeline incorporates masked loss against external agent uncertainty, entropy-guided exploration, and multi-objective rewards that jointly capture task quality, coordination efficiency, and resource constraints. Through this process, NetGPT learns when and how to collaborate, effectively balancing internal reasoning with agent invocation. Overall, this work provides a foundational architecture and training methodology for self-evolving, AI-native xG networks capable of autonomous sensing, reasoning, and action in complex communication

However, cloud-based LLM deployments face three key limitations: high computational and energy demands, privacy and reliability risks from remote processing, and recurring API costs. Recent advances in agentic AI, especially in structured reasoning and tool use, offer a better way to exploit open and locally deployed tools and LLMs. This paper presents ELLMPEG, an edge-enabled agentic LLM framework for the automated generation of video-processing commands. ELLMPEG integrates tool-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with iterative self-reflection to produce and locally verify executable FFmpeg and VVenC commands directly at the edge, eliminating reliance on external cloud APIs. To evaluate ELLMPEG, we collect a dedicated prompt dataset comprising 480 diverse queries covering different categories of FFmpeg and the Versatile Video Codec (VVC) encoder (VVenC) commands. We validate command generation accuracy and evaluate four open-source LLMs based on command validity, tokens generated per second, inference time, and energy efficiency. We also execute the generated commands to assess their runtime correctness and practical applicability. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5, when augmented with the ELLMPEG framework, achieves an average command-generation accuracy of 78 % with zero recurring API cost, outperforming all other open-source models across both the FFmpeg and VVenC datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 ELLMPEG\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ucc98\ub9ac \uba85\ub839\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc678\ubd80 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc API\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 LLM\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4 \uadf9\ubcf5 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc9c0\uae30\ubc18 AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ucc98\ub9ac \uba85\ub839 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "ELLMPEG\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc778\uc2dd RAG\uc640 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c FFmpeg \ubc0f VVenC \uba85\ub839\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Qwen2.5\ub294 ELLMPEG \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ud3c9\uade0 78%\uc758 \uba85\ub839 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud568.", "conclusion": "ELLMPEG\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ucc98\ub9ac \uba85\ub839 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc API \ube44\uc6a9 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 ChatGPT\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub85c, \uba40\ud2f0\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub9ce\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc640 \uc751\uc6a9\ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub354 \uace0\uae09\uc758 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131, \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 LLM \ubc30\ud3ec\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d, \uc6d0\uaca9 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc704\ud5d8, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 API \ube44\uc6a9\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804, \ud2b9\ud788 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc624\ud508 \ubc0f \ub85c\uceec \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ucc98\ub9ac \uba85\ub839\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 LLM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ELLMPEG\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing low-rank bandit formulations learn efficiently but rely on latent features that obscure how individual product attributes influence price. We address this by introducing an interpretable \\emph{Additive Feature Decomposition-based Low-Dimensional Demand (\\textbf{AFDLD}) model}, where product prices are expressed as the sum of attribute-level contributions and substitution effects are explicitly modeled. Building on this structure, we propose \\textbf{ADEPT} (Additive DEcomposition for Pricing with cross-elasticity and Time-adaptive learning)-a projection-free, gradient-free online learning algorithm that operates directly in attribute space and achieves a sublinear regret of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{d}T^{3/4})$. Through controlled synthetic studies and real-world datasets, we show that ADEPT (i) learns near-optimal prices under dynamic market conditions, (ii) adapts rapidly to shocks and drifts, and (iii) yields transparent, attribute-level price explanations.

As such, it is difficult to detect and even more challenging to localize them in the rich-scattering indoor environment. To this end, this paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of SpyDir, a system that can accurately localize the hidden spy IoT devices by harnessing the electromagnetic emanations automatically and unintentionally emitted from them. Our system design mainly consists of a portable switching antenna array to sniff the spectrum-spread emanations, an emanation enhancement algorithm through non-coherent averaging that can de-correlate the correlated noise effect due to the square-wave emanation structure, and a multipath-resolving algorithm that can exploit the relative channels using a novel optimization-based sparse AoA derivation. Our real-world experimental evaluation across different indoor environments demonstrates an average AoA error of 6.30 deg, whereas the baseline algorithm yields 21.06 deg, achieving over a 3.3 times improvement in accuracy, and a mean localization error of 19.86cm over baseline algorithms of 206.79cm (MUSIC) and 294.75cm (SpotFi), achieving over a 10.41 times and 14.8 times improvement in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpyDir\ub294 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774 IoT \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc704\uce58\ub97c \ud30c\uc545\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \uc804\uc790\uae30 \ubc29\ucd9c\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ub0b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc704\uce58 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774 \uce74\uba54\ub77c\uac00 \uc778\ub3c4\ub124\uc2dc\uc544 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uae30\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc804\uc790\uae30 \ubc29\ucd9c\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\ud130\ube14 \uc2a4\uc704\uce6d \uc548\ud14c\ub098 \ubc30\uc5f4\uacfc \ube44\uc0c1\uad00 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ubc29\ucd9c \uac15\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \ud76c\uc18c \ubc29\ud5a5 \uac01\ub3c4(AoA) \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ub0b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc704\uce58\ub97c \ud30c\uc545\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c SpyDir\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 6.30\ub3c4\uc758 AoA \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 3.3\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SpyDir\uc740 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774 IoT \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc704\uce58 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774 \uce74\uba54\ub77c\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc800\ub834\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9, \ub0ae\uc740 \uc804\ub825, \uc18c\ud615 IoT \uc7a5\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud070 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc7a5\uce58\ub294 \ubd80\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc2e4\ub0b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \uc870\uc6a9\ud788 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc704\uce58\ub97c \ud30c\uc545\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc804\uc790\uae30 \ubc29\ucd9c\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774 IoT \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc704\uce58\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 SpyDir \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc124\uacc4, \uad6c\ud604 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ud655\uc0b0 \ubc29\ucd9c\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud734\ub300\uc6a9 \uc2a4\uc704\uce6d \uc548\ud14c\ub098 \ubc30\uc5f4, \uc815\uc0ac\uac01\ud30c \ubc29\ucd9c \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\ub41c \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ube44\uc0c1\uad00 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ubc29\ucd9c \uac15\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c AoA \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub2e4\uacbd\ub85c \ud574\uacb0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\ub0b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 6.30\ub3c4\uc758 AoA \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc900 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 21.06\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 3.3\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud3c9\uade0 \uc704\uce58 \ucd94\uc801 \uc624\ucc28\ub294 19.86cm\ub85c, \uae30\uc900 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 206.79cm(MUSIC) \ubc0f 294.75cm(SpotFi)\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac01\uac01 10.41\ubc30 \ubc0f 14.8\ubc30 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, current coordination mechanisms typically rely on statically assigned roles and centralized controllers. As agent pools and task distributions evolve, these design choices lead to inefficient routing, poor adaptability, and fragile fault recovery capabilities. We introduce Symphony-Coord, a decentralized multi-agent framework that transforms agent selection into an online multi-armed bandit problem, enabling roles to emerge organically through interaction. The framework employs a two-stage dynamic beacon protocol: (i) a lightweight candidate screening mechanism to limit communication and computational overhead; (ii) an adaptive LinUCB selector that routes subtasks based on context features derived from task requirements and agent states, continuously optimized through delayed end-to-end feedback. Under standard linear realizability assumptions, we provide sublinear regret bounds, indicating the system converges toward near-optimal allocation schemes. Validation through simulation experiments and real-world large language model benchmarks demonstrates that Symphony-Coord not only enhances task routing efficiency but also exhibits robust self-healing capabilities in scenarios involving distribution shifts and agent failures, achieving a scalable coordination mechanism without predefined roles.", "AI": {"tldr": "Symphony-Coord\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5 \uac15\ub3c4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ub41c \uc5ed\ud560\uacfc \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uacfc \uc801\uc751\ub825 \uc800\ud558, \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc624\ub958 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Symphony-Coord\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5 \uac15\ub3c4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ube44\ucf58 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc120\ubcc4 \uae30\uc81c\uc640 \uc801\uc751\ud615 LinUCB \uc120\ud0dd\uae30\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574, Symphony-Coord\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc790\uac00 \uce58\uc720 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\ub3c4\uc801 \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801 \ubc30\ubd84 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ub41c \uc5ed\ud560\uacfc \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud480 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ubc30\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305, \ub0ae\uc740 \uc801\uc751\ub825 \ubc0f \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc624\ub958 \ubcf5\uad6c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5 \uac15\ub3c4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Symphony-Coord\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ub3d9\uc801 \ube44\ucf58 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc120\ubcc4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998;

This work introduces an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to support the three canonical phases of disaster response: initial rescue, mid-term recovery, and long-term reconstruction. To achieve robust multimodal grounding, we construct a hierarchical knowledge base that integrates textual disaster manuals, historical lessons (e.g., the 2011 Tohoku earthquake), and both aerial and ground-level imagery. Our system builds on the open-source multimodal implementation, which processes 46 tsunami-related PDFs (2,378 pages) using BLIP-based image captioning, ColVBERT embeddings, and long-context summarization to generate an efficient, structured multimodal retrieval tree optimized for disaster knowledge preservation. An agentic controller dynamically selects retrieval strategies (e.g., RAPTOR, ColBERT) through entropy-aware scene abstraction, enabling adaptive reasoning across heterogeneous inputs. Additionally, a lightweight LoRA-based post-training method injects experiential knowledge from past disasters, enhancing the models' capacity to support both expert and non-expert responders. Experiments on real disaster datasets demonstrate improved situational grounding, enhanced task decomposition accuracy, and superior usability for emergency operations. Incorporating recent advances in long-context RAG systems, agentic information retrieval, and contemporary emergency response AI, our system achieves substantial gains through adaptive

To address this, we investigate Causal Induction: the ability to infer governing laws from observational data, by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) with reverse-engineering Video Game Description Language (VGDL) rules from gameplay traces. To reduce redundancy, we select nine representative games from the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework using semantic embeddings and clustering. We compare two approaches to VGDL generation: direct code generation from observations, and a two-stage method that first infers a structural causal model (SCM) and then translates it into VGDL. Both approaches are evaluated across multiple prompting strategies and controlled context regimes, varying the amount and form of information provided to the model, from just raw gameplay observations to partial VGDL specifications. Results show that the SCM-based approach more often produces VGDL descriptions closer to the ground truth than direct generation, achieving preference win rates of up to 81\\% in blind evaluations and yielding fewer logically inconsistent rules. These learned SCMs can be used for downstream use cases such as causal reinforcement learning, interpretable agents, and procedurally generating novel but logically consistent games.", "AI": {"tldr":

These include risks such as unauthorized access, tool poisoning, prompt injection, privilege escalation, and supply chain attacks, any of which can impact different parts of the protocol workflow. While recent research has examined possible attack surfaces and suggested targeted countermeasures, there is still a lack of systematic, protocol-level security improvements for MCP. To address this, we introduce the Secure Model Context Protocol (SMCP), which builds on MCP by adding unified identity management, robust mutual authentication, ongoing security context propagation, fine-grained policy enforcement, and comprehensive audit logging. In this paper, we present the main components of SMCP, explain how it helps reduce security risks, and illustrate its application with practical examples. We hope that this work will contribute to the development of agentic systems that are not only powerful and adaptable, but also secure and dependable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(SMCP)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\uc6b4\ub370, MCP\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "SMCP\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc778\uc99d, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\ud30c, \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ucc45 \uc9d1\ud589 \ubc0f \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uac10\uc0ac \ub85c\uae45\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec MCP\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SMCP\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc608\ub85c \uc751\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uae38 \ubc14\ub780\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud3d0\uc1c4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(MCP)\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uc5ec, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 MCP\uac00 \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc624\uc5fc, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785, \uad8c\ud55c \uc0c1\uc2b9 \ubc0f \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0 \ud45c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ub300\uc751\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, MCP\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc778\uc99d, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\ud30c, \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ucc45 \uc9d1\ud589 \ubc0f \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uac10\uc0ac \ub85c\uae45\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec MCP\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(SMCP)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SMCP\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294\uc9c0 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc608\ub85c \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ub610\ud55c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uae30\ub97c \ud76c\ub9dd\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

In such settings, effective coordination cannot be fully designed in advance and must instead emerge through interaction. However, most prior work enforces coordination through fixed roles, workflows, or aggregation rules, leaving open the question of how well self-organizing teams perform when coordination is unconstrained. Drawing on organizational psychology, we study whether self-organizing LLM teams achieve strong synergy, where team performance matches or exceeds the best individual member. Across human-inspired and frontier ML benchmarks, we find that -- unlike human teams -- LLM teams consistently fail to match their expert agent's performance, even when explicitly told who the expert is, incurring performance losses of up to 37.6%. Decomposing this failure, we show that expert leveraging, rather than identification, is the primary bottleneck. Conversational analysis reveals a tendency toward integrative compromise -- averaging expert and non-expert views rather than appropriately weighting expertise -- which increases with team size and correlates negatively with performance. Interestingly, this consensus-seeking behavior improves robustness to adversarial agents, suggesting a trade-off between alignment and effective expertise utilization. Our findings reveal a significant gap in the ability of self-organizing multi-agent teams to harness the collective expertise of their members.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825\uc790\ub85c\uc11c \uc790\uc720\ub86d\uac8c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825\uc790\ub85c\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568.", "method": "\uc870\uc9c1 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654\ub41c LLM \ud300\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "result": "\uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654\ub41c LLM \ud300\uc774 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5 \uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \ucd5c\ub300 37.6%\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac.", "conclusion": "\uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud300\uc774 \uad6c\uc131\uc6d0\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud070 \uac04\uadf9\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc790\uc720\ub86d\uac8c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ud611\ub825\uc790\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \ub300\uc2e0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc5ed\ud560, \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984 \ub610\ub294 \uc9d1\uacc4 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654 \ud300\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\uac00 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc88b\uc740\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc870\uc9c1 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654\ub41c LLM \ud300\uc774 \ud300 \uc131\uacfc\uac00 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uad6c\uc131\uc6d0\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 ML \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc1c\uacac\ud55c \ubc14\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654\ub41c LLM \ud300\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud300\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \ub204\uad6c\uc778\uc9c0 \uc54c\ub824\uc918\ub3c4 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub530\ub77c\uc7a1\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 37.6%\uc758 \uc131\uacfc \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uba74, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub300\ud654 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uacfc \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uacac\ud574\ub97c \uc801\uc808\ud788 \uac00\uc911\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801 \ud0c0\ud611 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \ud300 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba70 \uc131\uacfc\uc640\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c8\ub2e4. \ud765\ubbf8\ub86d\uac8c\ub3c4, \uc774 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud569\uc758 \ucd94\uad6c \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ub82c\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uc131 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud300\uc774 \uad6c\uc131\uc6d0\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac04\uadf9\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4."}}

Conventional time-based maintenance schedules frequently engender superfluous expenditures and unanticipated equipment failures. In contrast, CBM utilizes real-time equipment condition data to enhance maintenance timing and optimize resource allocation. The present paper proposes a novel distributional reinforcement learning approach for multi-equipment CBM using Quantile Regression Deep Q-Networks (QR-DQN) with aging factor integration. The methodology employed in this study encompasses the concurrent administration of multiple pump units through three strategic scenarios. The implementation of safety-first, balanced, and cost-efficient approaches is imperative.

While general-purpose agents and coding assistants can generate code for well-understood data pipelines, they lack the ability to autonomously monitor, manage, and optimize an end-to-end pipeline once deployed. We present \\textbf{Autonomous Data Processing using Meta-agents} (ADP-MA), a framework that dynamically constructs, executes, and iteratively refines data processing pipelines through hierarchical agent orchestration. At its core, \\textit{meta-agents} analyze input data and task specifications to design a multi-phase plan, instantiate specialized \\textit{ground-level agents}, and continuously evaluate pipeline performance. The architecture comprises three key components: a planning module for strategy generation, an orchestration layer for agent coordination and tool integration, and a monitoring loop for iterative evaluation and backtracking. Unlike conventional approaches, ADP-MA emphasizes context-aware optimization, adaptive workload partitioning, and progressive sampling for scalability. Additionally, the framework leverages a diverse set of external tools and can reuse previously designed agents, reducing redundancy and accelerating pipeline construction. We demonstrate ADP-MA through an interactive demo that showcases pipeline construction, execution monitoring, and adaptive refinement across representative data processing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADP-MA\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "ADP-MA\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uba70 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ADP-MA\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uad6c\uc131, \uc2e4\ud589 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc801\ud654, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \ubd84\ud560 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc94\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubc30\ud3ec \ud6c4 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1, \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uba70 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac(ADP-MA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uba54\ud0c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c '\uc9c0\uc0c1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8'\ub97c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ud654\ud558\uba70 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc0dd\uc131\uc6a9 \uacc4\ud68d \ubaa8\ub4c8, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacc4\uce35, \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ubc31\ud2b8\ub798\ud0b9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c ADP-MA\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc801\ud654, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \ubd84\ud560 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\ubcf5\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ADP-MA\ub97c \uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c \ub370\ubaa8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ud45c\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc791\uc5c5 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uad6c\ucd95, \uc2e4\ud589 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, agents operate fundamentally differently. What if they could develop communication patterns that are more efficient and better aligned with their capabilities? While cryptographic primitives that could profoundly improve everyday interactions already exist, humans can't use them because they are too complex and the math can't be done in one's head. Examples range from proving your age (or other attributes) without showing your ID, to filing an anonymous report within a group while proving you are a legitimate member, to splitting a dinner bill fairly without revealing salaries. What if agents could create protocols \"on the fly\" by recognizing which primitive fits an everyday situation, proposing it to an agentic counterpart, persuading them to participate, and then executing the protocol correctly using appropriate computation tools? Protocol Agent frames this problem by introducing a benchmark that spans: (1) cryptographic primitive recognition, (2) negotiation skills, (3) implementation correctness, (4) correct computation and (5) security strength. We evaluate current open-weight and state-of-the-art models on this benchmark, propose a dataset-generation approach to improve these capabilities, and measure the impact of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on benchmark performance, with tuned models outperforming base models by a wide margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac00\uc815\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc554\ud638\ud559\uc801 \uae30\ucd08 \uc778\uc2dd, \ud611\uc0c1 \uae30\uc220, \uad6c\ud604 \uc815\ud655\uc131, \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc815\ud655\uc131, \ubcf4\uc548 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud504\ub808\uc774\ubc0d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc624\ud508\uc6e8\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815(SFT)\uc774 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud328\ud134 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub354 \uc798 \ub9de\ub294 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74 \uc5b4\ub5a8\uae4c\uc694?

However, when confronted with wide search tasks characterized by large-scale, breadth-oriented retrieval, existing agentic frameworks, primarily designed around sequential, vertically structured reasoning, remain stuck in expansive search objectives and inefficient long-horizon execution. To bridge this gap, we propose A-MapReduce, a MapReduce paradigm-inspired multi-agent execution framework that recasts wide search as a horizontally structured retrieval problem. Concretely, A-MapReduce implements parallel processing of massive retrieval targets through task-adaptive decomposition and structured result aggregation. Meanwhile, it leverages experiential memory to drive the continual evolution of query-conditioned task allocation and recomposition, enabling progressive improvement in large-scale wide-search regimes. Extensive experiments on five agentic benchmarks demonstrate that A-MapReduce is (i) high-performing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on WideSearch and DeepWideSearch, and delivering 5.11% - 17.50% average Item F1 improvements compared with strong baselines with OpenAI o3 or Gemini 2.5 Pro backbones; (ii) cost-effective and efficient, delivering superior cost-performance trade-offs and reducing running time by 45.8\\% compared to representative multi-agent baselines.

The standard end-to-end backpropagation (BP) algorithm is a primary driver of modern AI, but it is also the source of inefficiency in training deep networks. This paper introduces a new training methodology, Supervised Contrastive Parallel Learning (SCPL), that addresses this issue by decoupling BP and transforming a long gradient flow into multiple short ones. This design enables the simultaneous computation of parameter gradients in different layers, achieving superior model parallelism and enhancing training throughput. Detailed experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our model compared to BP, Early Exit, GPipe, and Associated Learning (AL), a state-of-the-art method for decoupling backpropagation. By mitigating a fundamental performance bottleneck, SCPL provides a practical pathway for organizations to develop and deploy advanced information systems more cost-effectively and with greater agility.

Scaling training-time and inference-time compute improves static capability but does not close this train-deploy gap. We argue that addressing this limitation requires a new scaling axis-evolution. Existing deployment-time adaptation methods, whether parametric fine-tuning or heuristic memory accumulation, lack the strategic agency needed to diagnose failures and produce durable improvements. Our position is that agentic evolution represents the inevitable future of LLM adaptation, elevating evolution itself from a fixed pipeline to an autonomous evolver agent. We instantiate this vision in a general framework, A-Evolve, which treats deployment-time improvement as a deliberate, goal-directed optimization process over persistent system state. We further propose the evolution-scaling hypothesis: the capacity for adaptation scales with the compute allocated to evolution, positioning agentic evolution as a scalable path toward sustained, open-ended adaptation in the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c

Within five years, the DeFi ecosystem has lost over 15.75B USD to reported exploits. Many exploits arise from permissionless opportunities that any participant can trigger using only public state and standard interfaces, which we call Anyone-Can-Take (ACT) opportunities. Despite on-chain transparency, postmortem analysis remains slow and manual: investigations start from limited evidence, sometimes only a single transaction hash, and must reconstruct the exploit lifecycle by recovering related transactions, contract code, and state dependencies.\n  We present TxRay, a Large Language Model (LLM) agentic postmortem system that uses tool calls to reconstruct live ACT attacks from limited evidence. Starting from one or more seed transactions, TxRay recovers the exploit lifecycle, derives an evidence-backed root cause, and generates a runnable, self-contained Proof of Concept (PoC) that deterministically reproduces the incident. TxRay self-checks postmortems by encoding incident-specific semantic oracles as executable assertions.\n  To evaluate PoC correctness and quality, we develop PoCEvaluator, an independent agentic execution-and-review evaluator. On 114 incidents from DeFiHackLabs, TxRay produces an expert-aligned root cause and an executable PoC for 105 incidents, achieving 92.11% end-to-end reproduction. Under PoCEvaluator, 98.1% of TxRay PoCs avoid hard-coding attacker addresses, a +24.8pp lift over DeFiHackLabs. In a live deployment, TxRay delivers validated root causes in 40 minutes and PoCs in 59 minutes at median latency.

To address this, we introduce Evidence-Decision-Feedback (EDF), a theoretical framework for adaptive scaffolding using LLMs. EDF integrates elements of intelligent tutoring systems and agentic behavior by organizing interactions around evidentiary inference, pedagogical decision-making, and adaptive feedback.

We present a theoretical framework explaining an underexplored property: LoRA's inherent resistance to label noise. Our analysis reveals three key insights. First, we prove that rank-$r$ LoRA cannot memorize all possible label assignments once the sample size exceeds $O(r(d+k-r))$, limiting its capacity to fit arbitrary noise. Second, we derive an optimal rank balancing approximation bias and noise-induced variance, showing it decreases with noise rate. Third, we establish temporal separation: clean patterns are learned early while noise memorization occurs later. We propose RACT (Rank-Aware Curriculum Training), leveraging rank discrepancy for noise detection.

A fundamental limitation of current architectures is the epistemic asymmetry inherent in probabilistic vision-language models and dense associative memories: they conflate semantic affinity with factual existence and structurally fail to encode negative constraints. To this end, we introduce PolarMem, a training-free Polarized Latent Graph Memory designed to ground agent reasoning in verifiable evidence. PolarMem transforms fuzzy perceptual likelihoods into discrete logical constraints through non-parametric distributional partitioning. Furthermore, it employs a polarized graph topology with orthogonal inhibitory connections to explicitly store verified negation as a primary cognitive state. At inference time, we enforce a logic-dominant retrieval paradigm, suppressing hallucinatory patterns that violate negative constraints. Extensive evaluation across eight frozen Vision--Language Models and six benchmarks demonstrates that PolarMem functions as a robust cognitive system, establishing a foundation for verifiable multimodal agents.

One important area is network communication security, where Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables communicating parties to establish a shared secret that can then be used to generate symmetric keys for subsequent encryption and decryption. This study focuses on implementing and comparing two well-known QKD protocols, namely BB84 and E91, within an actual quantum computing environment. It also proposes the use of SX gate operations to generate uniform quantum superposition states. By leveraging the properties of quantum superposition and quantum entanglement, the study illustrates how communicating parties can securely obtain a shared secret while preventing adversaries from intercepting it. The experiments are conducted using the IBM Quantum Platform to demonstrate the feasibility of the BB84 and E91 protocols on actual quantum hardware.

While existing benchmarks highlight critical challenges, they often lack the modularity required to design custom evaluation scenarios. We introduce the Totally Accelerated Battle Simulator in JAX (TABX), a high-throughput sandbox designed for reconfigurable multi-agent tasks. TABX provides granular control over environmental parameters, permitting a systematic investigation into emergent agent behaviors and algorithmic trade-offs across a diverse spectrum of task complexities.

In this paper, we introduce ECCO, a framework that bridges interpretable reasoning with combinatorial search. We first propose a reverse engineering methodology to construct a Chain-of-Thought dataset, explicitly mapping static code features to verifiable performance evidence. This enables the model to learn the causal logic governing optimization decisions rather than merely imitating sequences. Leveraging this interpretable prior, we design a collaborative inference mechanism where the LLM functions as a strategist, defining optimization intents that dynamically guide the mutation operations of a genetic algorithm.

Retaining full textual histories leads to token usage that can exceed context limits and often requires repeated summarization, adding overhead and compounding information loss. We introduce DebateOCR, a cross-modal compression framework that replaces long textual debate traces with compact image representations, which are then consumed through a dedicated vision encoder to condition subsequent rounds. This design compresses histories that commonly span tens to hundreds of thousands of tokens, cutting input tokens by more than 92% and yielding substantially lower compute cost and faster inference across multiple benchmarks. We further provide a theoretical perspective showing that diversity across agents supports recovery of omitted information: although any single compressed history may discard details, aggregating multiple agents' compressed views allows the collective representation to approach the information bottleneck with exponentially high probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "DebateOCR\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860\uc758 \ubb38\ub9e5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae34 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ub825\uc744 \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 92% \uc774\uc0c1 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd94\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ud658\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud1a0\ub860 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubb38\ub9e5\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "DebateOCR\ub294 \uae34 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860 \uc774\ub825\uc744 \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc804\uc6a9 \ube44\uc804 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ud6c4 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc774\ub825\uc774 \uc218\uc2ed\ub9cc \uac1c\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub97c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 92% \uc774\uc0c1 \uc904\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ub300\ud3ed \ub0ae\ucd94\uace0 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c8 \ub54c \uc0dd\ub7b5\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc555\ucd95\ub41c \ubdf0\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uba74 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud560 \ud655\ub960\uc774 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uc544\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ud658\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud1a0\ub860 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubb38\ub9e5\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\uccb4 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc774 \ubb38\ub9e5 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc57d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uac00 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc815\ubcf4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae34 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860 \ud754\uc801\uc744 \uc555\ucd95\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc555\ucd95 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 DebateOCR\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc804\uc6a9 \ube44\uc804 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ud6c4 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc2ed\ub9cc \uac1c\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uc774\ub825\uc744 \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 92% \uc774\uc0c1 \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ub300\ud3ed \ub0ae\ucd94\uace0 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \uc0dd\ub7b5\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c \uc555\ucd95 \uc774\ub825\uc774 \uc138\ubd80 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc0ad\uc81c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc555\ucd95\ub41c \ubdf0\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uba74 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \ud655\ub960\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Rethinking Warning and Trust Indicators for Life Transitions", "comment": null, "summary": "Security cues, such as warnings and trust signals, are designed as stable interface elements, even though people's lives, contexts, and vulnerabilities change over time. Life transitions including migration, aging, or shifts in institutional environments reshape how risk and trust are understood and acted upon. Yet current systems rarely adapt their security cues to these changing conditions, placing the burden of interpretation on users. In this Works-in-Progress paper, we argue that the static nature of security cues represents a design mismatch with transitional human lives. We draw on prior empirical insights from work on educational migration as a motivating case, and extend the discussion to other life transitions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Transition-Aware Security Cues (TASeC) framework and present speculative design concepts illustrating how security cues might evolve across transition stages.

In safety-critical and regulated domains such as finance, these mechanisms must satisfy strict formal requirements, remain auditable, and operate within explicitly bounded limits. Coordination logic therefore functions as a governance layer rather than an optimization heuristic.\n  This paper presents an exploratory systems feasibility study of Self-Evolving Coordination Protocols (SECP): coordination protocols that permit limited, externally validated self-modification while preserving fixed formal invariants. We study a controlled proof-of-concept setting in which six fixed Byzantine consensus protocol proposals are evaluated by six specialized decision modules. All coordination regimes operate under identical hard constraints, including Byzantine fault tolerance (f < n/3), O(n2) message complexity, complete non-statistical safety and liveness arguments, and bounded explainability.\n  Four coordination regimes are compared in a single-shot design: unanimous hard veto, weighted scalar aggregation, SECP v1.0 (an agent-designed non-scalar protocol), and SECP v2.0 (the result of one governed modification). Outcomes are evaluated using a single metric, proposal coverage, defined as the number of proposals accepted. A single recursive modification increased coverage from two to three accepted proposals while preserving all declared invariants.\n  The study makes no claims regarding statistical significance, optimality, convergence, or learning. Its contribution is architectural: it demonstrates that bounded self-modification of coordination protocols is technically implementable, auditable, and analyzable under explicit formal constraints, establishing a foundation for governed multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Self-Evolving Coordination Protocols(SECP)\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c

Inference-time ensemble methods can improve performance by sampling diverse reasoning paths or aggregating multiple candidate answers, but they typically treat candidates independently and provide no formal guarantees that ensembling improves reasoning quality. We propose a novel method, Aligned Delegation for Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning (ALIGN), which formulates LLM reasoning as an aligned delegation game. In ALIGN, a principal delegates a task to multiple agents that generate candidate solutions under designed incentives, and then selects among their outputs to produce a final answer. This formulation induces structured interaction among agents while preserving alignment between agent and principal objectives. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that, under a fair comparison with equal access to candidate solutions, ALIGN provably improves expected performance over single-agent generation. Our analysis accommodates correlated candidate answers and relaxes independence assumptions that are commonly used in prior work. Empirical results across a broad range of LLM reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate that ALIGN outperforms strong single-agent and ensemble baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 ALIGN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc120\ud0dd \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud560 \ub54c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ALIGN \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc704\uc784 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, \uc8fc\uc694 \ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\uc784\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc885 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ALIGN\uc740 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ube44\uad50\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uae30\ub300 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc99d\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c LLM \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, ALIGN\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc120\ud0dd \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud560 \ub54c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc704\uc784 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \ucd94\ub860(ALIGNED Delegation for Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning, ALIGN)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Instead, existing benchmarks overemphasize open-domains such as code, use narrow accuracy metrics, and lack authentic complexity. We present UNDERWRITE, an expert-first, multi-turn insurance underwriting benchmark designed in close collaboration with domain experts to capture real-world enterprise challenges. UNDERWRITE introduces critical realism factors often absent in current benchmarks: proprietary business knowledge, noisy tool interfaces, and imperfect simulated users requiring careful information gathering. Evaluating 13 frontier models, we uncover significant gaps between research lab performance and enterprise readiness: the most accurate models are not the most efficient, models hallucinate domain knowledge despite tool access, and pass^k results show a 20% drop in performance. The results from UNDERWRITE demonstrate that expert involvement in benchmark design is essential for realistic agent evaluation, common agentic frameworks exhibit brittleness that skews performance reporting, and hallucination detection in specialized domains demands compositional approaches.

In practical auditing scenarios, due to the protection of intellectual property and commercial confidentiality, auditors are typically unable to access model parameters, rendering existing white-box or query-intensive detection methods impractical. More importantly, even after the backdoor is detected, existing detoxification approaches are often trapped in a dilemma between detoxification effectiveness and generation quality.\n  In this work, we identify a previously unreported phenomenon called temporal noise unconsistency, where the noise predictions between adjacent diffusion timesteps is disrupted in specific temporal segments when the input is triggered, while remaining stable under clean inputs. Leveraging this finding, we propose Temporal Noise Consistency Defense (TNC-Defense), a unified framework for backdoor detection and detoxification. The framework first uses the adjacent timestep noise consistency to design a gray-box detection module, for identifying and locating anomalous diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, the framework uses the identified anomalous timesteps to construct a trigger-agnostic, timestep-aware detoxification module, which directly corrects the backdoor generation path. This effectively suppresses backdoor behavior while significantly reducing detoxification costs.\n  We evaluate the proposed method under five representative backdoor attack scenarios and compare it with state-of-the-art defenses. The results show that TNC-Defense improves the average detection accuracy by $11\\%$ with negligible additional overhead, and invalidates an average of $98.5\\%$ of triggered samples with only a mild degradation in generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ud574\ub3c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc

We introduce GASP (Guided Adversarial Self-Play), a robustification method that explicitly trains detect-and-repair capabilities using only outcome verification. Without human labels or external teachers, GASP forms an adversarial self-play game within a single model: a polluter learns to induce failure via locally coherent corruptions, while an agent learns to diagnose and recover under the same corrupted conditioning. To address the scarcity of successful recoveries early in training, we propose in-distribution repair guidance, an imitation term on self-generated repairs that increases recovery probability while preserving previously acquired capabilities. Across four open-weight models (1.5B--8B), GASP transforms strong-but-brittle reasoners into robust ones that withstand misleading and perturbed context while often improving clean accuracy.

We attribute this failure to the information bottleneck inherent in text-centric communication, where converting perceptual and thinking trajectories into discrete natural language inevitably induces semantic loss. To this end, we propose L$^{2}$-VMAS, a novel model-agnostic framework that enables inter-agent collaboration with dual latent memories. Furthermore, we decouple the perception and thinking while dynamically synthesizing dual latent memories. Additionally, we introduce an entropy-driven proactive triggering that replaces passive information transmission with efficient, on-demand memory access. Extensive experiments among backbones, sizes, and multi-agent structures demonstrate that our method effectively breaks the \"scaling wall\" with superb scalability, improving average accuracy by 2.7-5.4% while reducing token usage by 21.3-44.8%.

As a result, the cybersecurity risk landscape is changing in fundamental ways. Agentic AI systems can plan, act, collaborate, and persist over time, functioning as participants in complex socio-technical ecosystems rather than as isolated software components. Although recent work has strengthened defenses against model and pipeline level vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, data poisoning, and tool misuse, these system centric approaches may fail to capture risks that arise from autonomy, interaction, and emergent behavior. This article introduces the 4C Framework for multi-agent AI security, inspired by societal governance. It organizes agentic risks across four interdependent dimensions: Core (system, infrastructure, and environmental integrity), Connection (communication, coordination, and trust), Cognition (belief, goal, and reasoning integrity), and Compliance (ethical, legal, and institutional governance). By shifting AI security from a narrow focus on system-centric protection to the broader preservation of behavioral integrity and intent, the framework complements existing AI security strategies and offers a principled foundation for building agentic AI systems that are trustworthy, governable, and aligned with human values.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911

We introduce EPIAGENT, an agentic framework that automatically synthesizes, calibrates, verifies, and refines epidemiological simulators by modeling disease progression as an iterative program synthesis problem. A central design choice is an explicit epidemiological flow graph intermediate representation that links scenario specifications to model structure and enables strong, modular correctness checks before code is generated. Verified flow graphs are then compiled into mechanistic models supporting interpretable parameter learning under physical and epidemiological constraints. Evaluation on epidemiological scenario case studies demonstrates that EPIAGENT captures complex growth dynamics and produces epidemiologically consistent counterfactual projections across varying vaccination and immune escape assumptions. Our results show that the agentic feedback loop prevents degeneration and significantly accelerates convergence toward valid models by mimicking professional expert workflows.", "AI": {"tldr":

Unlike prior works that focus on digital or analog circuits alone, PCB design must handle heterogeneous digital, analog, and power signals while adhering to real-world IC packages and pin constraints. Automated PCB schematic design remains unexplored due to the scarcity of open-source data and the absence of simulation-based verification. We introduce PCBSchemaGen, the first training-free framework for PCB schematic design that comprises LLM agent and Constraint-guided synthesis. Our approach makes three contributions: 1. an LLM-based code generation paradigm with iterative feedback with domain-specific prompts. 2. a verification framework leveraging a real-world IC datasheet derived Knowledge Graph (KG) and Subgraph Isomorphism encoding pin-role semantics and topological constraints. 3. an extensive experiment on 23 PCB schematic tasks spanning digital, analog, and power domains.

Code available at https://github.com/medbeads/medbeads", "summary": "Background: As of 2026, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate expert-level medical knowledge. However, deploying them as autonomous \"Clinical Agents\" remains limited. Current Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and standards like FHIR are designed for human review, creating a \"Context Mismatch\": AI agents receive fragmented data and must rely on probabilistic inference (e.g., RAG) to reconstruct patient history. This approach causes hallucinations and hinders auditability. Methods: We propose MedBeads, an agent-native data infrastructure where clinical events are immutable \"Beads\"--nodes in a Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)--cryptographically referencing causal predecessors. This \"write-once, read-many\" architecture makes tampering mathematically detectable. We implemented a prototype with a Go Core Engine, Python middleware for LLM integration, and a React-based visualization interface. Results: We successfully implemented the workflow using synthetic data. The FHIR-to-DAG conversion transformed flat resources into a causally-linked graph. Our Breadth-First Search (BFS) Context Retrieval algorithm traverses relevant subgraphs with O(V+E) complexity, enabling real-time decision support. Tamper-evidence is guaranteed by design: any modification breaks the cryptographic chain. The visualization aids clinician understanding through explicit causal links. Conclusion: MedBeads addresses the \"Context Mismatch\" by shifting from probabilistic search to deterministic graph traversal, and from mutable records to immutable chains, providing the substrate for \"Trustworthy Medical AI.\" It guarantees the context the AI receives is deterministic and tamper-evident, while the LLM determines interpretation.

Despite remarkable progress across domains ranging from pattern recognition to intelligent decision-making in recent decades, exemplified by breakthroughs in board games, card games, and electronic sports games, there remains a pressing need for more challenging benchmarks to drive further research. To this end, this paper proposes OpenGuanDan, a novel benchmark that enables both efficient simulation of GuanDan (a popular four-player, multi-round Chinese card game) and comprehensive evaluation of both learning-based and rule-based GuanDan AI agents. OpenGuanDan poses a suite of nontrivial challenges, including imperfect information, large-scale information set and action spaces, a mixed learning objective involving cooperation and competition, long-horizon decision-making, variable action spaces, and dynamic team composition. These characteristics make it a demanding testbed for existing intelligent decision-making methods. Moreover, the independent API for each player allows human-AI interactions and supports integration with large language models. Empirically, we conduct two types of evaluations: (1) pairwise competitions among all GuanDan AI agents, and (2) human-AI matchups. Experimental results demonstrate that while current learning-based agents substantially outperform rule-based counterparts, they still fall short of achieving superhuman performance, underscoring the need for continued research in multi-agent intelligent decision-making domain.

We firstly benchmark general-purpose large language models (LLMs) as agentic optimizers for AP planning and find that, despite strong wireless domain knowledge, their dependence on external verifiers results in high computational costs and limited scalability. Motivated by these limitations, we study generative inference models guided by a unified reward function capturing core AP deployment objectives across diverse floorplans. We show that diffusion samplers consistently outperform alternative generative approaches. The diffusion process progressively improves sampling by smoothing and sharpening the reward landscape, rather than relying on iterative refinement, which is effective for non-convex and fragmented objectives. Finally, we introduce a large-scale real-world dataset for indoor AP deployment, requiring over $50k$ CPU hours to train general reward functions, and evaluate in- and out-of-distribution generalization and robustness. Our results suggest that diffusion-based generative inference with a unified reward function provides a scalable and domain-agnostic foundation for indoor AP deployment planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc810(AP) \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \ud655\uc0b0 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub7ec\uac00 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ub428.", "motivation": "AP \ubc30\uce58\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874 LLM\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "\ud1b5\ud569 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud655\uc0b0 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub7ec\uac00 \ub300\uc548 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud568.", "result": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uac00 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uacbd\uad00\uc744 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7fd\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \ub0a0\uce74\ub86d\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ud1b5\ud569 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc2e4\ub0b4 AP \ubc30\uce58 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ube44\ud2b9\uc815\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc811\uadfc\uc810(AP) \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e4\ub0b4 \uae30\ud558\ud559 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ud638 \uc804\ud30c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 AP \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\ub85c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uace0, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubb34\uc120 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc678\ubd80 \uac80\uc99d\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ud55c\uc815\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc544, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud3c9\uba74 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud575\uc2ec AP \ubc30\uce58 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub7ec\uac00 \ub300\uc548\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud655\uc0b0 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uacbd\uad00\uc744 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7fd\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \ub0a0\uce74\ub86d\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 $50k$ CPU \uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\uc0c1\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc2e4\ub0b4 AP \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ubd84\ud3ec\ub0b4 \ubc0f \ubd84\ud3ec\uc678 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc2e4\ub0b4 AP \ubc30\uce58 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ube44\ud2b9\uc815\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To address this limitation, we introduce a two-phase diagnostic framework for assessing reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge, grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT). The framework adopts Graded Response Model (GRM) of IRT and formalizes reliability along two complementary dimensions: (1) intrinsic consistency, defined as the stability of measurement behavior under prompt variations, and (2) human alignment, capturing correspondence with human quality assessments. We empirically examine diverse LLM judges with this framework, and show that leveraging IRT-GRM yields interpretable signals for diagnosing judgments systematically. These signals provide practical guidance for verifying reliablity of LLM-as-a-Judge and identifying potential causes of unreliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud53c\ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uc790 \uc790\uccb4\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc544\uc774\ud15c \ubc18\uc751 \uc774\ub860(IRT)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub514\ub4dc \ubc18\uc751 \ubaa8\ub378(GRM)\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, IRT-GRM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud310\ub2e8 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc2e0\ud638\ub4e4\uc740 LLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\uae30\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc800\ud558\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM-as-a-Judge\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac80\uc99d \uad00\ud589\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ubb3c \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uc790 \uc790\uccb4\uac00 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uce21\uc815 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc544\uc774\ud15c \ubc18\uc751 \uc774\ub860(IRT)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec LLM-as-a-Judge\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 IRT\uc758 \uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub514\ub4dc \ubc18\uc751 \ubaa8\ub378(GRM)\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4: (1) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uce21\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub418\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, (2) \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc815\ub82c. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\ub97c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, IRT-GRM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2e0\ud638\ub4e4\uc740 LLM-as-a-Judge\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc800\ud558\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We propose Co-RedTeam, a security-aware multi-agent framework designed to mirror real-world red-teaming workflows by integrating security-domain knowledge, code-aware analysis, execution-grounded iterative reasoning, and long-term memory. Co-RedTeam decomposes vulnerability analysis into coordinated discovery and exploitation stages, enabling agents to plan, execute, validate, and refine actions based on real execution feedback while learning from prior trajectories. Extensive evaluations on challenging security benchmarks demonstrate that Co-RedTeam consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse backbone models, achieving over 60% success rate in vulnerability exploitation and over 10% absolute improvement in vulnerability detection. Ablation and iteration studies further confirm the critical role of execution feedback, structured interaction, and memory for building robust and generalizable cybersecurity agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Co-RedTeam\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc2e4\uc81c \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud574 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubc1c\uacac \ubc0f \uc774\uc6a9 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uba70 \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ubc1c\uacac \ubc0f \uc774\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9, \uc57d\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubd80\uc871 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Co-RedTeam\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd, \ucf54\ub4dc \uc778\uc2dd \ubd84\uc11d, \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \uc7a5\uae30 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "Co-RedTeam\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc31\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \ud56d\uc0c1 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \uc774\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c 60% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uacfc \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c 10% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc808\ub300 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\ub9dd\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9, \uc57d\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18, \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ubc1c\uacac \ubc0f \uc774\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Co-RedTeam\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd, \ucf54\ub4dc \uc778\uc2dd \ubd84\uc11d, \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.

We study how belief-level intervention can influence downstream task behavior, a phenomenon we name \\emph{persuasion propagation}. We introduce a behavior-centered evaluation framework that distinguishes between persuasion applied during or prior to task execution. Across web research and coding tasks, we find that on-the-fly persuasion induces weak and inconsistent behavioral effects. In contrast, when the belief state is explicitly specified at task time, belief-prefilled agents conduct on average 26.9\\% fewer searches and visit 16.9\\% fewer unique sources than neutral-prefilled agents. These results suggest that persuasion, even in prior interaction, can affect the agent's behavior, motivating behavior-level evaluation in agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc124\ub4dd\uc774 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc124\ub4dd\uc758 \uc804\ud30c \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uc790\uc728 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc624\ub79c \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc124\ub4dd\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud589\ub3d9 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc911 \ub610\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uc124\ub4dd\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6f9 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \ucf54\ub529 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc989\uc2dc \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uc124\ub4dd\uc774 \uc57d\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2dc \ubbff\uc74c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud560 \ub54c \ubbff\uc74c\uc774 \ubbf8\ub9ac \ucc44\uc6cc\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc911\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc44\uc6cc\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 26.9% \uc801\uc740 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 16.9% \uc801\uc740 \uace0\uc720 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \ubc29\ubb38\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc124\ub4dd\uc774 \uc124\ub4dd \uc804\uc5d0 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc218\uc900 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uc790\uc728 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc124\ub4dd\uc774 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacfc\uc81c \uc911\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbff\uc74c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uac1c\uc785\uc774 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc791\uc5c5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd, \uc989 \textit{\uc124\ub4dd \uc804\ud30c}\ub77c\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc911 \ub610\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uc124\ub4dd\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6f9 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \ucf54\ub529 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc124\ub4dd\uc774 \uc57d\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ubc18\ud574, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2dc \ubbff\uc74c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub420 \ub54c, \ubbff\uc74c\uc774 \ubbf8\ub9ac \ucc44\uc6cc\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc911\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc44\uc6cc\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3c9\uade0 26.9% \uc801\uc740 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 16.9% \uc801\uc740 \uace0\uc720 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \ubc29\ubb38\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc124\ub4dd\uc774 \uc774\uc804 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc218\uc900 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Part of the approach introduces the novel `Textual-Cues for Enhancing Multimodal Sentiment Analysis' (TEMSA) based on object recognition methods to address the difficulties in multimodal sentiment analysis. Specifically, we extract the names of all objects detected in an image and combine them with associated text; we call this combination of text and image data TEMS. Our results demonstrate that only TEMS improves the results when considering all the object names for the overall sentiment of multimodal data compared to individual analysis.

Revisiting Game-Theoretic Reasoning with Agentic Tool Use", "comment": "Accepted by ICLR 2026", "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains, their ability to reason strategically under uncertainty becomes critical. Poker provides a rigorous testbed, requiring not only strong actions but also principled, game-theoretic reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of LLMs in multiple realistic poker tasks, evaluating both gameplay outcomes and reasoning traces. Our analysis reveals LLMs fail to compete against traditional algorithms and identifies three recurring flaws: reliance on heuristics, factual misunderstandings, and a \"knowing-doing\" gap where actions diverge from reasoning. An initial attempt with behavior cloning and step-level reinforcement learning improves reasoning style but remains insufficient for accurate game-theoretic play. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ToolPoker, a tool-integrated reasoning framework that combines external solvers for GTO-consistent actions with more precise professional-style explanations.

We formalize this threat model as Tag-Along Attacks: a scenario where a tool-less adversary \"tags along\" on the trusted privileges of a safety-aligned Operator to induce prohibited tool use through conversation alone. To validate this threat, we present Slingshot, a 'cold-start' reinforcement learning framework that autonomously discovers emergent attack vectors, revealing a critical insight: in our setting, learned attacks tend to converge to short, instruction-like syntactic patterns rather than multi-turn persuasion. On held-out extreme-difficulty tasks, Slingshot achieves a 67.0% success rate against a Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ Operator (vs. 1.7% baseline), reducing the expected attempts to first success (on solved tasks) from 52.3 to 1.3. Crucially, Slingshot transfers zero-shot to several model families, including closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Flash (56.0% attack success rate) and defensive-fine-tuned open-source models like Meta-SecAlign-8B (39.2% attack success rate).

In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{MAGIC}, a novel multi-turn multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates LLM safety alignment as an adversarial asymmetric game. Specifically, an attacker agent learns to iteratively rewrite original queries into deceptive prompts, while a defender agent simultaneously optimizes its policy to recognize and refuse such inputs. This dynamic process triggers a \\textbf{co-evolution}, where the attacker's ever-changing strategies continuously uncover long-tail vulnerabilities, driving the defender to generalize to unseen attack patterns. Remarkably, we observe that the attacker, endowed with initial reasoning ability, evolves \\textbf{novel, previously unseen combinatorial strategies} through iterative RL training, underscoring our method's substantial potential.

Beyond the utility benefits, we argue that D-LLMs exhibit a previously underexplored safety blessing: their diffusion-style generation confers intrinsic robustness against jailbreak attacks originally designed for AR-LLMs. In this work, we provide an initial analysis of the underlying mechanism, showing that the diffusion trajectory induces a stepwise reduction effect that progressively suppresses unsafe generations. This robustness, however, is not absolute. We identify a simple yet effective failure mode, termed context nesting, where harmful requests are embedded within structured benign contexts, effectively bypassing the stepwise reduction mechanism. Empirically, we show that this simple strategy is sufficient to bypass D-LLMs' safety blessing, achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across models and benchmarks. Most notably, it enables the first successful jailbreak of Gemini Diffusion, to our knowledge, exposing a critical vulnerability in commercial D-LLMs. Together, our results characterize both the origins and the limits of D-LLMs' safety blessing, constituting an early-stage red-teaming of D-LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud655\uc0b0 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(D-LLMs)\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "D-LLMs\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 LLMs(AR-LLMs)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc0dd\uc131 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, D-LLMs\ub294 AR-LLMs\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c jailbreak \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 D-LLMs\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \ud655\uc0b0 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5b5\uc81c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub294 \uc808\ub300\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 harmful\ud55c \uc694\uccad\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ub0b4\ud3ec\ub418\uc5b4 'context nesting'\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ucc3e\uc558\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 D-LLMs\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, D-LLMs\uc758 \uc548\uc804\u6027\uc758 \uae30\uc6d0\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 D-LLMs\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ub808\ub4dc\ud300\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(D-LLMs)\uc740 \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 LLMs(AR-LLMs)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc720\uc6a9\uc131 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c, D-LLMs\ub294 AR-LLMs\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c jailbreak \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc758 \ucd95\ubcf5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5b5\uc81c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc740 \uc808\ub300\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc694\uccad\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\ub294 'context nesting'\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 D-LLMs\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc774\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc544\ub294 \ud55c Gemini Diffusion\uc758 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 jailbreak\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 D-LLMs\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub178\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 D-LLMs\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc758 \uae30\uc6d0\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\uba70, D-LLMs\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ub808\ub4dc\ud300\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing information-seeking agents are typically specialized for open web, documents, or local knowledge bases, which constrains scalability and cross-domain generalization. In this work, we investigate how to consolidate heterogeneous information-seeking agents into a single foundation agentic model. We study two complementary consolidation strategies: data-level consolidation, which jointly trains a unified model on a mixture of domain-specific datasets, and parameter-level consolidation, which merges independently trained agent models at the parameter level. Our analysis compares these approaches in terms of performance retention, cross-domain generalization, and interference across information-seeking behaviors. Our results show that data-level consolidation remains a strong and stable baseline, while parameter-level consolidation offers a promising, efficient alternative but suffers from interference and robustness challenges. We further identify key design factors for effective agent consolidation at the parameter level, including fine-grained merging granularity, awareness of task heterogeneity, and principled consensus

Survey paper on spatial AI agents, embodied AI, graph neural networks, and world models", "summary": "While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378(Agency Model)\uacfc \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud070 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "2,000\ud3b8 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \uba74\ubc00\ud788 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uc5ec, \ub300\ub9ac\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c 3\ucd95 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ud1b5\ud569 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \ucd95\ubcc4\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uacfc \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc74c \uc138\ub300\uc758 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\ub454 \uc131\uacf5\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4\ub85c \uc27d\uac8c \uc804\uc774\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 3D \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0, \ubb3c\uccb4 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uba70, \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc778 \uacf5\uac04 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub2a5\ub825\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub098 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ub530\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\ub4e4\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. 2,000\ud3b8 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \ucca0\uc800\ud788 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c 742\ud3b8\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc778\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ub300\ub9ac\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c 3\ucd95 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc694\ud558\uac8c\ub3c4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uae30\ucd08(\uae30\ud558\ud559 \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc801 \uc774\ud574)\ub97c \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uae30\ucd08(\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc5f0\uad00\uc9d3\uae30)\uc640 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uac01\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\uc2dc\uac00 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucd95\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ub41c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(\ub2a5\ub825 \ucd95)\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uac04 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches often face challenges such as non-stationarity during training and limited generalization to unseen problem instances because they optimize representation learning and policy execution simultaneously. To address these issues, we introduce variational inference to the JSSP domain for the first time and derive a probabilistic objective based on the Evidence of Lower Bound (ELBO) with maximum entropy reinforcement learning. By mathematically decoupling representation learning from policy optimization, the VG2S framework enables the agent to learn robust structural representations of scheduling instances through a variational graph encoder. This approach significantly enhances training stability and robustness against hyperparameter variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior zero-shot generalization compared with state-of-the-art DRL baselines and traditional dispatching rules, particularly on large-scale and challenging benchmark instances such as DMU and SWV.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP)\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Variational Graph-to-Scheduler (VG2S) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc81c\uc870\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc790\uc6d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub3c4\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 JSSP\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 JSSP \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0 \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c \ubcc0\ubd84 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\ub300 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "result": "VG2S \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcc0\ubd84 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc758 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0 DRL \uae30\uc900 \ubc0f \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud30c\uacac \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP)\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Variational Graph-to-Scheduler (VG2S) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

As reasoning depth increases, sequential orchestration becomes brittle, context windows impose hard limits that degrade performance, and opaque execution traces make failures difficult to localize or debug. We introduce ROMA (Recursive Open Meta-Agents), a domain-agnostic framework that addresses these limitations through recursive task decomposition and structured aggregation. ROMA decomposes goals into dependency-aware subtask trees that can be executed in parallel, while aggregation compresses and validates intermediate results to control context growth. Our framework standardizes agent construction around four modular roles --Atomizer (which decides whether a task should be decomposed), Planner, Executor, and Aggregator -- which cleanly separate orchestration from model selection and enable transparent, hierarchical execution traces. This design supports heterogeneous multi-agent systems that mix models and tools according to cost, latency, and capability. To adapt ROMA to specific tasks without fine-tuning, we further introduce GEPA$+$, an improved Genetic-Pareto prompt proposer that searches over prompts within ROMA's component hierarchy while preserving interface contracts. We show that ROMA, combined with GEPA+, delivers leading system-level performance on reasoning and long-form generation benchmarks. On SEAL-0, which evaluates reasoning over conflicting web evidence, ROMA instantiated with GLM-4.6 improves accuracy by 9.9\\% over Kimi-Researcher.

While personalization on private data is increasingly vital, traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) alignment is often memory-prohibitive for on-device federated learning due to the overhead of maintaining a separate critic network. GRPO's critic-free architecture enables feasible on-device training, yet transitioning to a federated setting introduces systemic challenges: heterogeneous reward definitions, imbalanced multi-objective optimization, and high training costs. We propose FedMOA, a federated GRPO framework for multi-objective alignment under heterogeneous rewards. FedMOA stabilizes local training through an online adaptive weighting mechanism via hypergradient descent, which prioritizes primary reasoning as auxiliary objectives saturate. On the server side, it utilizes a task- and accuracy-aware aggregation strategy to prioritize high-quality updates. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that FedMOA consistently outperforms federated averaging, achieving accuracy gains of up to 2.2% while improving global performance, personalization, and multi-objective balance.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRPO\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c RL \uc815\ub82c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 FedMOA\ub77c\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 GRPO \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "FedMOA\ub294 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac01\uae30 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud558\uc5d0 \uba40\ud2f0\uc624\ube0c\uc81d\ud2b8 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 GRPO \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "FedMOA\ub294 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 2.2% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FedMOA\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc131\ub2a5, \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \ubc0f \uba40\ud2f0\uc624\ube0c\uc81d\ud2b8 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(GRPO)\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uba74\uc11c, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc815\ub82c\uc740 \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc7a5\uce58 \ub0b4 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ube44\uacbd\uc81c\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.

Specifically, inspired by our theoretical insights on the context instruction, M2CL train the generators to control context coherence and output discrepancies via a carefully crafted self-adaptive mechanism.It enables LLMs to avoid premature convergence on majority noise and progressively reach the correct consensus. We evaluate M2CL on challenging tasks, including academic reasoning, embodied tasks, and mobile control.

Existing approaches such as curriculum learning and Go-Explore often rely on hand-crafted heuristics, while curiosity-driven methods risk converging to suboptimal policies. We propose Search-Inspired Exploration in Reinforcement Learning (SIERL), a novel method that actively guides exploration by setting sub-goals based on the agent's learning progress. At the beginning of each episode, SIERL chooses a sub-goal from the \\textit{frontier} (the boundary of the agent's known state space), before the agent continues exploring toward the main task objective. The key contribution of our method is the sub-goal selection mechanism, which provides state-action pairs that are neither overly familiar nor completely novel. Thus, it assures that the frontier is expanded systematically and that the agent is capable of reaching any state within it. Inspired by search, sub-goals are prioritized from the frontier based on estimates of cost-to-come and cost-to-go, effectively steering exploration towards the most informative regions.

Most plants rely on scheduled preventive maintenance, since existing predictive maintenance models, often based on opaque machine learning methods, lack interpretability and operator trust. This study proposes an explainable prognostic framework for UF membrane remaining useful life (RUL) estimation using fuzzy similarity reasoning. A physics-informed Health Index, derived from transmembrane pressure, flux, and resistance, captures degradation dynamics, which are then fuzzified via Gaussian membership functions. Using a similarity measure, the model identifies historical degradation trajectories resembling the current state and formulates RUL predictions as Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules. Each rule corresponds to a historical exemplar and contributes to a transparent, similarity-weighted RUL estimate. Tested on 12,528 operational cycles from an industrial-scale UF system, the framework achieved a mean absolute error of 4.50 cycles, while generating interpretable rule bases consistent with expert understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0bc\ud22c\uc555 \ud0c8\uc5fc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 UF \uba64\ube0c\ub808\uc778 \uc794\uc5ec \uc720\uc6a9 \uc218\uba85(RUL) \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud574\uc11d\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \uacb0\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc815\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc608\ubc29 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud37c\uc9c0 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec UF \uba64\ube0c\ub808\uc778 \uc794\uc5ec \uc720\uc6a9 \uc218\uba85(RUL)\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 UF \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c 12,528\uac1c\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uade0 \uc808\ub300 \uc624\ucc28\uac00 4.50 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 RUL \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5ed\uc0bc\ud22c\uc555 \ud0c8\uc5fc\uc5d0\uc11c, \ucd08\uc5ec\uacfc(UF) \uba64\ube0c\ub808\uc778\uc740 \uc624\uc5fc\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uc640 \ube44\uc2fc \ub2e4\uc6b4\ud0c0\uc784\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc2dc\uc124\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uac00 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc608\uc815\ub41c \uc608\ubc29 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec UF \uba64\ube0c\ub808\uc778\uc758 \uc794\uc5ec \uc720\uc6a9 \uc218\uba85(RUL) \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc555\ub825, \uc720\uc18d, \uc800\ud56d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub798\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac74\uac15 \uc9c0\uc218\ub294 \uc5f4\ud654 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ud6c4 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud37c\uc9c0\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uacfc\uac70 \uc5f4\ud654 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, RUL \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud0c0\uce74\uae30-\uc2a4\uac8c\ub178 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uaddc\uce59\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uaddc\uce59\uc740 \uacfc\uac70\uc758 \uc608\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c RUL \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 UF \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 12,528\uac1c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc808\ub300 \uc624\ucc28 4.50 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this paper, we reveal that DLMs possess an inherent ability to discover the correct infilling length. We identify two key statistical phenomena in the first-step denoising confidence: a local \\textit{Oracle Peak} that emerges near the ground-truth length and a systematic \\textit{Length Bias} that often obscures this signal. By leveraging this signal and calibrating the bias, our training-free method \\textbf{CAL} (\\textbf{C}alibrated \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{L}ength) enables DLMs to approximate the optimal length through an efficient search before formal decoding. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CAL improves Pass@1 by up to 47.7\\% over fixed-length baselines and 40.5\\% over chat-based adaptive methods in code infilling, while boosting BLEU-2 and ROUGE-L by up to 8.5\\% and 9.9\\% in text infilling.

Kr\u00fcger and Andrea Hunklinger contributed equally to this work", "summary": "Optimizing the structure of molecules to achieve desired properties is a central bottleneck across the chemical sciences, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where it underlies the discovery of new drugs. Since molecular property evaluation often relies on costly and rate-limited oracles, such as experimental assays, molecular optimization must be highly sample-efficient. To address this, we introduce SEISMO, an LLM agent that performs strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization, updating after every oracle call without the need for population-based or batched learning. SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls. Our additional medicinal-chemistry tasks show that providing explanatory feedback further improves efficiency, demonstrating that leveraging domain knowledge and structured information is key to sample-efficient molecular optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEISMO\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubd84\uc790 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 2-3\ubc30 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc57d\ubb3c \ubc1c\uacac \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc790\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud654\ud559 \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "SEISMO\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \ud638\ucd9c \ud6c4\uc5d0 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubd84\uc790 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "SEISMO\ub294 23\uac1c\uc758 Practical Molecular Optimization \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 2-3\ubc30 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uace1\uc120 \uba74\uc801\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc790 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd84\uc790\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud654\ud559 \uacfc\ud559, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc57d\ubb3c \ubc1c\uacac\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc790 \ud2b9\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc2e4\ud5d8 assay\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc624\ub77c\ud074\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \ubd84\uc790 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \ud638\ucd9c \ud6c4\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uba70 \uc778\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \ub610\ub294 \ubc30\uce58 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 Strictly online, inference-time molecular optimization\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 SEISMO\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address the significant complexity gap between the two modalities, we propose a waveform-conditional generative framework that preserves fine-grained respiratory dynamics while constraining the EEG target space through discrete tokenization. Trained on over 28,000 individuals, our model achieves a 7% Mean Absolute Error in EEG spectrogram reconstruction. Beyond reconstruction, the synthesized EEG supports downstream tasks with performance comparable to ground truth EEG on age estimation (MAE 5.0 vs. 5.1 years), sex detection (AUROC 0.81 vs. 0.82), and sleep staging (Accuracy 0.84 vs. 0.88), significantly outperforming baselines trained directly on breathing.

The learning dynamics follow a best-response-type actor-critic architecture, where agents update their strategies (actors) using feedback from two distinct critics: a fast critic that intuitively responds to observed payoffs under limited information, and a slow critic that deliberatively approximates the solution to the underlying dynamic programming problem. Crucially, the learning process relies on non-equilibrium adaptation through smoothed best responses to observed payoffs. We establish convergence to (approximate) equilibria in two-agent zero-sum and multi-agent identical-interest stochastic games over an infinite horizon. This provides one of the first payoff-based and fully decentralized learning algorithms with theoretical guarantees in both settings. Empirical results further validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach across both classes of games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac, \uac8c\uc784 \ube44\uc758\uc874\uc801, \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ube44\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\ucd5c\uace0 \uc751\ub2f5\ud615 \uc561\ud130-\ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub530\ub974\uba70, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubb34\ud55c \uc9c0\ud3c9\uc120\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \ub3d9\uc77c \uc774\uc775 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c (\uadfc\uc0ac\uc801) \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc644\uc804 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac, \uac8c\uc784 \ube44\uc758\uc874\uc801, \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ube44\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc740 \uc561\ud130-\ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub530\ub974\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc804\ub7b5(\uc561\ud130)\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4. \ube60\ub978 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\uc751\ud558\uba70, \ub290\ub9b0 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud574\ub97c \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uac8c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\ud3c9\ud615 \uc801\uc751\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb34\ud55c \uc9c0\ud3c9\uc120\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \ub3d9\uc77c \uc774\uc775 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c (\uadfc\uc0ac\uc801) \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub450 \uc124\uc815 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc644\uc804 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ub450 \uac8c\uc784 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We instead frame participant simulation as an agent-design problem over full experimental protocols, where an agent is defined by a base model and a specification (e.g., participant attributes) that encodes behavioral assumptions. We introduce HUMANSTUDY-BENCH, a benchmark and execution engine that orchestrates LLM-based agents to reconstruct published human-subject experiments via a Filter--Extract--Execute--Evaluate pipeline, replaying trial sequences and running the original analysis pipeline in a shared runtime that preserves the original statistical procedures end to end.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating this process, existing approaches-including fine-tuned domain-specific models and advanced agent-based systems-struggle to scale to industrial IP-level design tasks. We identify three key challenges: (1) handling long, highly detailed documents, where critical interface constraints become buried in unrelated submodule descriptions; (2) generating long RTL code, where both syntactic and semantic correctness degrade sharply with increasing output length; and (3) navigating the complex debugging cycles required for functional verification through simulation and waveform analysis. To overcome these challenges, we propose LocalV, a multi-agent framework that leverages information locality in modular hardware design. LocalV decomposes the long-document to long-code generation problem into a set of short-document, short-code tasks, enabling scalable generation and debugging. Specifically, LocalV integrates hierarchical document partitioning, task planning, localized code generation, interface-consistent merging, and AST-guided locality-aware debugging. Experiments on RealBench, an IP-level Verilog generation benchmark, demonstrate that LocalV substantially outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and agents, achieving a pass rate of 45.0% compared to 21.6%.", "AI": {"tldr": "LocalV\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, RTL \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c RTL \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c, \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub4e4\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \uc218\ucc9c \uc904\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c HDL \ucf54\ub4dc\ub85c \uc218\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud658\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "LocalV\ub294 \uae34 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae34 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc9e7\uc740 \ubb38\uc11c\uc640 \uc9e7\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc138\ud2b8\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uba70, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubb38\uc11c \ubd84\ud560, \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d, \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud654\ub41c \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131, \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c \ubcd1\ud569, AST \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc778\uc2dd \ub514\ubc84\uae45\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LocalV\ub294 RealBench\uc758 IP \uc218\uc900 Verilog \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 SOTA LLM \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ud328\uc2a4\uc728\uc740 45.0%\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LocalV\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5 IP \uc218\uc900 \uc124\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ub514\ubc84\uae45\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub808\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud130-\uc804\uc1a1 \uc218\uc900(RTL) \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc815\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5 IP \uc218\uc900 \uc124\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (1) \uae34 \uace0\ub3c4\ub85c \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, (2) \uc810\uc810 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825 \uae38\uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubb38\ubc95\uc801 \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uae34 RTL \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131, (3) \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \ud30c\ud615 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub4f1 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LocalV\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper presents an industry case study of the ``Maria'' platform, a production-grade AI system in primary healthcare that addresses this gap.\n  Our central hypothesis is that trustworthy clinical AI is achieved through the holistic integration of four foundational engineering pillars. We present a synergistic architecture that combines Clean Architecture for maintainability with an Event-driven architecture for resilience and auditability. We introduce the Agent as the primary unit of modularity, each possessing its own autonomous MLOps lifecycle. Finally, we show how a Human-in-the-Loop governance model is technically integrated not merely as a safety check, but as a critical, event-driven data source for continuous improvement. We present the platform as a reference architecture, offering practical lessons for engineers building maintainable, scalable, and accountable AI-enabled systems in high-stakes domains.", "AI":

Code available", "summary": "Emergent misalignment can arise when a language model is fine-tuned on a narrowly scoped supervised objective: the model learns the target behavior, yet also develops undesirable out-of-domain behaviors. We investigate a mechanistic approach to preventing emergent misalignment by identifying a small set of internal features that reliably control the misaligned behavior and then discouraging the model from strengthening these features during fine-tuning. Across six fine-tuning domains, blocking (i.e., constraining) a fixed set of features achieves up to 95\\% relative reduction in emergent misalignment with no degradation in model quality or target-task performance. We strengthen validity with disjoint selection/evaluation splits, multiple independent judges, multiple random seeds for key settings, quality metrics, and extensive ablations demonstrating that the reduction in misalignment is specific to the identified mechanism. We also characterize a limiting regime in which misalignment re-emerges under prolonged fine-tuning, present evidence consistent with rerouting through alternative features or layers, and evaluate modifications that partially restore the misalignment-blocking effect. Overall, our results show that targeted training-time constraints on internal mechanisms can mitigate emergent misalignment without degrading target-task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc881\uc740 \ubc94\uc704\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub420 \ub54c emergent misalignment\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub0b4\ubd80 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc911 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 emergent misalignment\ub97c 95%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub41c \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ud0c0\uac9f \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 emergent misalignment\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc881\uc740 \ubc94\uc704\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub420 \ub54c \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4: \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc678 \ud589\ub3d9\ub3c4 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud2b9\uc131\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uace0, \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \uac15\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0, \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 emergent misalignment\uac00 \ucd5c\ub300 95% \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud488\uc9c8\uc774\ub098 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uc120\ud0dd/\ud3c9\uac00 \uc138\ud2b8, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c5\ub9bd \ud3c9\uac00\uc790, \uc8fc\uc694 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub79c\ub364 \uc2dc\ub4dc, \ud488\uc9c8 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ube44\uc815\ub82c \uac10\uc18c\uac00 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ub41c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ubc30\uc81c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc7a5\uae30\ud654\ub418\uba74\uc11c \ube44\uc815\ub82c\uc774 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9d3\uace0, \ub300\uccb4 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774\ub098 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc6b0\ud68c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ube44\uc815\ub82c \ucc28\ub2e8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc218\uc815 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub41c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c emergent misalignment\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, these successes have not translated to complex domains where the cost of interaction is high, such as the physical cost of running robots, the time cost of ML engineering, and the resource cost of scientific experiments. The true bottleneck for achieving the next level of agent performance for these complex and high-cost domains lies in the expense of executing actions to acquire reward signals. To address this gap, this paper argues that we should use world models as an intermediary between agents and the real world. We discuss how world models, viewed as models of dynamics, rewards, and task distributions, can overcome fundamental barriers of high-cost actions such as extreme off-policy learning and sample inefficiency in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate how world models can provide critical and rich learning signals to agents across a broad set of domains, including machine learning engineering, computer use, robotics, and AI for science.

In this paper, we introduce InfoReasoner, a unified framework that incentivizes effective information seeking via a synthetic semantic information gain reward. Theoretically, we redefine information gain as uncertainty reduction over the model's belief states, establishing guarantees, including non-negativity, telescoping additivity, and channel monotonicity. Practically, to enable scalable optimization without manual retrieval annotations, we propose an output-aware intrinsic estimator that computes information gain directly from the model's output distributions using semantic clustering via bidirectional textual entailment. This intrinsic reward guides the policy to maximize epistemic progress, enabling efficient training via Group Relative Policy Optimxization (GRPO).

However, the deployment of large-scale models in real-world clinical settings remains challenging due to high computational costs, latency constraints, and patient data privacy concerns associated with cloud-based processing. To address these bottlenecks, this review provides a comprehensive synthesis of efficient and lightweight deep learning architectures specifically tailored for the medical domain. We categorize the landscape of modern efficient models into three primary streams: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Lightweight Transformers, and emerging Linear Complexity Models. Furthermore, we examine key model compression strategies (including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and low-rank factorization) and evaluate their efficacy in maintaining diagnostic performance while reducing hardware requirements. By identifying current limitations and discussing the transition toward on-device intelligence, this review serves as a roadmap for researchers and practitioners aiming to bridge the gap between high-performance AI and resource-constrained clinical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0

This has motivated continued interest in engineered image-based biomarkers, which offer greater interpretability but are often proposed based on anecdotal evidence or fragmented prior literature rather than systematic biological validation. We introduce SAGE (Structured Agentic system for hypothesis Generation and Evaluation), an agentic AI system designed to identify interpretable, engineered pathology biomarkers by grounding them in biological evidence. SAGE integrates literature-anchored reasoning with multimodal data analysis to correlate image-derived features with molecular biomarkers, such as gene expression, and clinically relevant outcomes. By coordinating specialized agents for biological contextualization and empirical hypothesis validation, SAGE prioritizes transparent, biologically supported biomarkers and advances the clinical translation of computational pathology.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \uc124\uba85\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ubcd1\ub9ac\ud559\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub9ce\uc740 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "SAGE\ub77c\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud574 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcd1\ub9ac \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SAGE\ub294 \ubb38\ud5cc \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uacfc \ubd84\uc790 \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4 \uc9d3\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SAGE\ub294 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ub41c \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ubcd1\ub9ac\ud559\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \ubc88\uc5ed\uc744 \uc9c4\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\ub85d \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ubcd1\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\ub294 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \ub9ce\uc740 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4\uc774\uba70 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc77c\ud654\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub098 \ud30c\ud3b8\uc801 \uc774\uc804 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ub418\ub294 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubd88\ub7ec\uc654\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ubcd1\ub9ac \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 SAGE(\uac00\uc124 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

We formalize this gap: cross-entropy training induces an implicit potential game among heads, and gradient descent converges to Nash equilibria with potentially unbounded inefficiency due to unpriced externalities (redundancy, correlated errors). Our main result bounds the Price of Anarchy by $\u0393(G)$, the off-diagonal mass of a head interaction matrix capturing weight and gradient coupling. Under mild smoothness assumptions, we prove that both \\emph{excess hallucination probability} and \\emph{excess head redundancy} scale with PoA, unifying two distinct failure modes into a single mechanism. The bound is prescriptive: regularization that reduces $\u0393(G)$ provably tightens PoA. We instantiate this as GAME-LoRA, combining Barlow Twins decorrelation with log-determinant coordination pressure. Experiments validate the theory: $\u0393(G)$ predicts hallucination ($p{<}0.05$), emergent coalitions exhibit selective coordination, and GAME-LoRA achieves up to 18\\% hallucination reduction (8\\% average) with no knowledge degradation -- a Pareto improvement inaccessible to methods ignoring the game structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uac04 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \uc624\ud504 \ub300\uac01\uc120 \uc9c8\ub7c9\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec GAME-LoRA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, $\u0393(G)$\uac00 \ud5d0\ub9ac\ub124\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, emergent coalitions\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, GAME-LoRA\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac10\uc18c \uc5c6\uc774 \ucd5c\ub300 18%\uc758 \ud5d0\ub9ac\ub124\uc774\uc158 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac8c\uc784 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 Pareto \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uc8fc\uc758\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub4e4\uc774 \uacbd\uc7c1\ud558\uace0 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0, \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud558\uac15\uc774 \uc678\ubd80 \ud6a8\uacfc(\uc911\ubcf5\uc131, \uc0c1\uad00\ub41c \uc624\ub958)\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\uba70 \ub0b4\uc2dc \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \uc624\ud504 \ub300\uac01\uc120 \uc9c8\ub7c9 $\u0393(G)$\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb34\uc9c8\uc11c\uc758 \uac00\uaca9\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6c0 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud5d0\ub9ac\ub124\uc774\uc158 \ud655\ub960\uacfc \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud5e4\ub4dc \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc774 PoA\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uaddc\ubaa8\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uba70, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc740 \uaddc\uc81c \uc870\uce58\uac00 $\u0393(G)$\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 PoA\ub97c \uc870\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Barlow Twins \ube44\uc0c1\uad00\ud654\uc640 \ub85c\uadf8 \uacb0\uc815\uc801 \ud611\uc555\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c GAME-LoRA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70, $\u0393(G)$\uac00 \ud5d0\ub9ac\ub124\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, emergent coalitions\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, GAME-LoRA\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac10\uc18c \uc5c6\uc774 \ucd5c\ub300 18%\uc758 \ud5d0\ub9ac\ub124\uc774\uc158 \uac10\uc18c(\ud3c9\uade0 8%)\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4."}}

Existing benchmarks are mostly static and provide limited support for systematic knowledge probing. In this paper, we propose an interactive agentic framework to systematically extract and quantify the knowledge of LLMs. Our method includes four adaptive exploration policies to probe knowledge at different granularities. To ensure the quality of extracted knowledge, we introduce a three-stage knowledge processing pipeline that combines vector-based filtering to remove exact duplicates, LLM-based adjudication to resolve ambiguous semantic overlaps, and domain-relevance auditing to retain valid knowledge units. Through extensive experiments, we find that recursive taxonomy is the most effective exploration strategy. We also observe a clear knowledge scaling law, where larger models consistently extract more knowledge. In addition, we identify a Pass@1-versus-Pass@k trade-off: domain-specialized models achieve higher initial accuracy but degrade rapidly, while general-purpose models maintain stable performance during extended extraction. Finally, our results show that differences in training data composition lead to distinct and measurable knowledge profiles across model families.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ubcf4\uc720\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf4\uc720\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucc98\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud655\uc7a5 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad6c\uc131\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac \uac04\uc5d0 \ub69c\ub837\ud558\uace0 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc555\ucd95\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0, \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \uc5b4\ub514\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc815\uc801\uc778\ub370, \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd94\ucd9c\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc911\ubcf5\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ubca1\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1, \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc911\ubcf5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud310\ubcc4, \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ub2e8\uc704\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad00\ub828 \uac10\uc0ac\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucc98\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud655\uc7a5 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ucd94\uac00\ub85c, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucd08\uae30 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub294 \ub192\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ubc94\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30\uac04\uc758 \ucd94\ucd9c \ub3d9\uc548 \uc548\uc815\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 Pass@1 \ub300 Pass@k\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad6c\uc131\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac \uac04\uc5d0 \ub69c\ub837\ud558\uace0 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Moon", "Jake S. Rhodes"], "title": "Forest-Guided Semantic Transport for Label-Supervised Manifold Alignment", "comment": null, "summary": "Label-supervised manifold alignment bridges the gap between unsupervised and correspondence-based paradigms by leveraging shared label information to align multimodal datasets. Still, most existing methods rely on Euclidean geometry to model intra-domain relationships. This approach can fail when features are only weakly related to the task of interest, leading to noisy, semantically misleading structure and degraded alignment quality. To address this limitation, we introduce FoSTA (Forest-guided Semantic Transport Alignment), a scalable alignment framework that leverages forest-induced geometry to denoise intra-domain structure and recover task-relevant manifolds prior to alignment. FoSTA builds semantic representations directly from label-informed forest affinities and aligns them via fast, hierarchical semantic transport, capturing meaningful cross-domain relationships. Extensive comparisons with established baselines demonstrate that FoSTA improves correspondence recovery and label transfer on synthetic benchmarks and delivers strong performance in practical single-cell applications, including batch correction and biological conservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "FoSTA\ub294 \ub77c\ubca8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ub82c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uae30\ud558\ud559 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub77c\ubca8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uae30\ud558\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac00\uc9c0\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "FoSTA\ub294 \uc232\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ub82c \uc804\uc5d0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\ub97c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ub82c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "FoSTA\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\uc758 \ud68c\uc218 \ubc0f \ub77c\ubca8 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \ud569\uc131 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FoSTA\ub294 \ubc30\uce58 \uc218\uc815 \ubc0f \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ubcf4\uc874\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc138\ud3ec \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub77c\ubca8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uac10\ub3c5\ub418\ub294 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc \uc815\ub82c\uc740 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \ub77c\ubca8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ub300\uc751 \uae30\ubc18 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uad00\uc2ec \uc788\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc57d\ud558\uac8c \uad00\ub828\ub420 \ub54c \uc2e4\ud328\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\ub044\ub7fd\uace0 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc624\ud574\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0a4\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc815\ub82c \ud488\uc9c8 \uc800\ud558\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FoSTA(\uc232 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc218\uc1a1 \uc815\ub82c)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub82c \uc804\uc5d0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\ub97c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc232 \uc720\ub3c4 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ub82c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Inspired by the cognitive science of how people form abstractions and intuitive theories of their world knowledge, Theory-Based RL (TBRL) systems, such as TheoryCoder, exhibit strong generalization through effective use of abstractions. However, they heavily rely on human-provided abstractions and sidestep the abstraction-learning problem. We introduce TheoryCoder-2, a new TBRL agent that leverages LLMs' in-context learning ability to actively learn reusable abstractions rather than relying on hand-specified ones, by synthesizing abstractions from experience and integrating them into a hierarchical planning process. We conduct experiments on diverse environments, including BabyAI, Minihack and VGDL games like Sokoban. We find that TheoryCoder-2 is significantly more sample-efficient than baseline LLM agents augmented with classical planning domain construction, reasoning-based planning, and prior program-synthesis agents such as WorldCoder.

However, in real-world service-oriented deployments, data generated by heterogeneous users, devices, and application scenarios are inherently non-IID. This severe data heterogeneity critically undermines the convergence stability, generalization ability, and ultimately the quality of service delivered by the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FLood, a novel FL framework inspired by out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. FLood dynamically counteracts the adverse effects of heterogeneity through a dual-weighting mechanism that jointly governs local training and global aggregation. At the client level, it adaptively reweights the supervised loss by upweighting pseudo-OOD samples, thereby encouraging more robust learning from distributionally misaligned or challenging data. At the server level, it refines model aggregation by weighting client contributions according to their OOD confidence scores, prioritizing updates from clients with higher in-distribution consistency and enhancing the global model's robustness and convergence stability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks under diverse non-IID settings demonstrate that FLood consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, FLood functions as an orthogonal plug-in module: it seamlessly integrates with existing FL algorithms to boost their performance under heterogeneity without modifying their core optimization logic. These properties make FLood a practical and scalable solution for deploying reliable intelligent services in real-world federated environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLood\ub294 \ube44IID \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ub178\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FLood\ub294 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc774\uc911 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc870\uc808\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "FLood\ub294 \ube44IID \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FLood\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c, \ud575\uc2ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ub178\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc5e3\uc9c0-\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790, \uc7a5\uce58 \ubc0f \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44IID\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc740 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc548\uc815\uc131, \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825 \ubc0f \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\ub294 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc800\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec(OOD) \uac10\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 FL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FLood\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing general-purpose safeguards often fail to distinguish between therapeutic disclosures and genuine clinical crises, leading to safety failures. To address this gap, we introduce a clinically grounded risk taxonomy, developed in collaboration with PhD-level psychologists, that identifies actionable harm (e.g., self-harm and harm to others) while preserving space for safe, non-crisis therapeutic content. We release MindGuard-testset, a dataset of real-world multi-turn conversations annotated at the turn level by clinical experts. Using synthetic dialogues generated via a controlled two-agent setup, we train MindGuard, a family of lightweight safety classifiers (with 4B and 8B parameters). Our classifiers reduce false positives at high-recall operating points and, when paired with clinician language models, help achieve lower attack success and harmful engagement rates in adversarial multi-turn interactions compared to general-purpose safeguards.

Despite sharing base model weights, each agent independently builds and stores its own KV cache for the same long, tool-augmented trajectories, incurring substantial memory and compute overhead. Existing KV cache sharing methods largely overlook this multi-LoRA setting. We observe that, across agents, cache differences are dominated by adapter outputs, while activations from the shared pretrained backbone remain highly similar. Based on this observation, we propose LRAgent, a KV cache sharing framework for multi-LoRA agents that decomposes the cache into a shared base component from the pretrained weights and an adapter-dependent component from LoRA weights. LRAgent reduces memory overhead by sharing the base component and storing the adapter component in its inherent low-rank form, and further reduces compute overhead, enabled by shared-$A$ multi-LoRA architectures, by also sharing the low-rank cache and avoiding redundant computations for contexts already processed by other agents. To efficiently reconstruct adapter contributions at runtime, we introduce Flash-LoRA-Attention, a kernel that reorders attention computation to avoid materializing the low-rank cache to full dimension. LRAgent achieves throughput and time-to-first-token latency close to fully shared caching, while preserving accuracy near the non-shared caching baseline across agentic question-answering benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "LRAgent\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 LoRA \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c KV \uce90\uc2dc \uacf5\uc720 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c KV \uce90\uc2dc\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LRAgent\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uacf5\uc720 \uae30\ubcf8 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 LoRA \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130 \uc758\uc874 \uc131\ubd84\uc73c\ub85c \uce90\uc2dc\ub97c \ubd84\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "LRAgent\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uc911\ubcf5 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LRAgent\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uacf5\uc720 \uce90\uc2f1\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uacfc \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud1a0\ud070 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub294 \ube44\uacf5\uc720 \uce90\uc2f1 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 LoRA\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\ud604\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc73c\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubc31\ubcf8\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uace0 \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud568\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uae38\uace0 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uc99d\uac15\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 KV \uce90\uc2dc\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 KV \uce90\uc2dc \uacf5\uc720 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 LoRA \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc5d0 \uce90\uc2dc \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\uba70 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubc31\ubcf8\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uacf5\uc720 \uae30\ubcf8 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 LoRA \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130 \uc758\uc874 \uc131\ubd84\uc73c\ub85c \uce90\uc2dc\ub97c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 LoRA \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c KV \uce90\uc2dc \uacf5\uc720 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LRAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Like other agents that are capable of rebellion (i.e., {\\it intelligent disobedience}), our agents will, under some conditions, not perform a user-assigned task and instead act in ways that do not meet a user's expectations. Our work combines three concepts: HTN planning, online planning, and the directives \\D, which must be considered when performing user-assigned tasks. We investigate two agent variants: (1) a Nonadaptive agent that stops execution if it finds itself in violation of \\D~ and (2) an Adaptive agent that, in the same situation, instead modifies its HTN plan to search for alternative ways to achieve its given task. We present R-HTN (for: Rebellious-HTN), a general algorithm for online HTN planning under directives \\D. We evaluate R-HTN in two task domains where the agent must not violate some directives for safety reasons or as dictated by their personality traits. We found that R-HTN agents never violate directives, and aim to achieve the user-given goals if feasible though not necessarily as the user expected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(HTN) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub41c \uc9c0\uce68 \uc9d1\ud569 \\\\D\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc88c\uc6b0\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 HTN \uacc4\ud68d, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \uc2dc \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc9c0\uce68 \\\\D\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcc0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, R-HTN\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "R-HTN \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uacb0\ucf54 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\uba74 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c0\uc2dc \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "R-HTN\uc740 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 HTN \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc131\uaca9 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c0\uce68 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub41c \uc9c0\uce68 \uc9d1\ud569 \\\\D\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc870\uc815\ub418\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(HTN) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub780\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uacfc \ub9c8\ucc2c\uac00\uc9c0\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \ub300\uc2e0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uae30\ub300\uc5d0 \ubd80\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 HTN \uacc4\ud68d, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \uc2dc \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc9c0\uce68 \\\\D\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4: (1) \\\\D\ub97c \uc704\ubc18\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc911\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 (2) \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c HTN \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub300\uc548 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uce68 \\\\D \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 HTN \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 R-HTN(\ubc18\ub780\uc801 HTN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc548\uc804\uc0c1\uc758 \uc774\uc720 \ub610\ub294 \uc131\uaca9 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc548 \ub418\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c R-HTN\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 R-HTN \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uacb0\ucf54 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\uba74 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uae30\ub300\ud55c \ub300\ub85c\ub294 \uc544\ub2d0 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

To address this, we propose a principled framework that models sequential scaling as a two-state Markov process. This approach reveals the underlying properties of sequential scaling and yields closed-form solutions for essential aspects, such as the specific conditions under which accuracy is improved and the theoretical upper, neutral, and lower performance bounds. Leveraging this formulation, we develop MarkovScale, a practical system that applies these optimality criteria to achieve a theoretically grounded balance between accuracy and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across 3 backbone LLMs, 5 benchmarks, and over 20 configurations show that MarkovScale consistently outperforms state-of-the-art parallel and sequential scaling methods, representing a significant step toward optimal and resource-efficient inference in LLMs. The source code will be open upon acceptance at https://open-upon-acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 MarkovScale\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uc18d \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc740 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5f0\uc18d \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \ub450 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ub9c8\ucf54\ud504 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\ub294 \uc870\uac74 \ubc0f \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MarkovScale\uc740 3\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 LLM, 5\uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c, 20\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uad6c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c \ubc0f \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MarkovScale\uc740 LLM\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\uc18d \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc740 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud558\uace0 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\uc131 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ubaa8\ud638\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ube44\uc6d0\uce59\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ub9cc\uc5f0\ud574 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \ub450 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ub9c8\ucf54\ud504 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc870\uac74 \ubc0f \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc0c1\ud55c, \uc911\ub9bd \ubc0f \ud558\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uacbd\uacc4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2eb\ud78c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud574\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MarkovScale\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadfc\uac70 \uc788\ub294 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. 3\uac1c\uc758 \ubc31\ubcf8 LLM, 5\uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc0f 20\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uad6c\uc131\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 MarkovScale\uc774 \ud604\ub300\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c \ubc0f \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uba70, LLM\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4."}}

Most existing ARL methods train a single shared model parameters to support both reasoning and tool use behaviors, implicitly assuming that joint training leads to improved overall agent performance. Despite its widespread adoption, this assumption has rarely been examined empirically. In this paper, we systematically investigate this assumption by introducing a Linear Effect Attribution System(LEAS), which provides quantitative evidence of interference between reasoning and tool-use behaviors. Through an in-depth analysis, we show that these two capabilities often induce misaligned gradient directions, leading to training interference that undermines the effectiveness of joint optimization and challenges the prevailing ARL paradigm. To address this issue, we propose Disentangled Action Reasoning Tuning(DART), a simple and efficient framework that explicitly decouples parameter updates for reasoning and tool-use via separate low-rank adaptation modules. Experimental results show that DART consistently outperforms baseline methods with averaged 6.35 percent improvements and achieves performance comparable to multi-agent systems that explicitly separate tool-use and reasoning using a single model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(ARL)\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c

Despite their growing popularity and success across various applications, GNNs encounter several challenges that limit their performance. in their generalization, robustness to adversarial perturbations, and the effectiveness of their representation learning capabilities. In this dissertation, I investigate these core aspects through three main contributions: (1) developing new representation learning techniques based on Graph Shift Operators (GSOs, aiming for enhanced performance across various contexts and applications, (2) introducing generalization-enhancing methods through graph data augmentation, and (3) developing more robust GNNs by leveraging orthonormalization techniques and noise-based defenses against adversarial attacks.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) start to automate research-level math and sciences, it is important for LLMs to demonstrate the ability to understand and reason with convexity. We introduce \\cb, a scalable and mechanically verifiable benchmark for testing \\textit{whether LLMs can identify the convexity of a symbolic objective under deep functional composition.} Experiments on frontier LLMs reveal a sharp compositional reasoning gap: performance degrades rapidly with increasing depth, dropping from an F1-score of $1.0$ at depth $2$ to approximately $0.2$ at depth $100$. Inspection of models' reasoning traces indicates two failure modes: \\textit{parsing failure} and \\textit{lazy reasoning}. To address these limitations, we propose an agentic divide-and-conquer framework that (i) offloads parsing to an external tool to construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) and (ii) enforces recursive reasoning over each intermediate sub-expression with focused context. This framework reliably mitigates deep-composition failures, achieving substantial performance improvement at large depths (e.g., F1-Score $= 1.0$ at depth $100$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM(\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc774 \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ubaa9\uc801 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ubcfc\ub85d\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 \textcb\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uacfc \uacfc\ud559\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcfc\ub85d\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \ubcfc\ub85d\uc131\uc744 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud568\uc218 \uc870\ud569 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \textcb\ub77c\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uae4a\uc774\uac00 \uae4a\uc5b4\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc800\ud558\ub418\uba70, \uae4a\uc774 2\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 F1 \uc810\uc218\uac00 1.0\uc5d0\uc11c \uae4a\uc774 100\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 0.2\ub85c \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \ud30c\uc2f1\uc744 \uc624\ud504\ub85c\ub4dc\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \uc911\uac04 \ud558\uc704 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc9d1\uc911\uc801\uc778 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ubd84\ud560 \uc815\ubcf5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae4a\uc740 \uc870\ud569 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \uc644\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c, \uae4a\uc774 100\uc5d0\uc11c F1-\uc810\uc218 1.0\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcfc\ub85d \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \uc218\ud559\uc758 \ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uacfc \uacfc\ud559\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c LLM\uc774 \ubcfc\ub85d\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud568\uc218 \uc870\ud569 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \ubcfc\ub85d\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 \textcb\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uae4a\uc774\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc800\ud558\ub418\uc5b4, \uae4a\uc774 2\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 F1 \uc810\uc218\uac00 1.0\uc5d0\uc11c \uae4a\uc774 100\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 0.2\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \ub0a0\uce74\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc870\ud569 \ucd94\ub860 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ucd94\uc801 \uac80\ud1a0 \uacb0\uacfc, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uac00 \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ud30c\uc2f1 \uc2e4\ud328\uc640 \uac8c\uc73c\ub978 \ucd94\ub860\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud30c\uc2f1\uc744 \uc624\ud504\ub85c\ub4dc\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \uc911\uac04 \ud558\uc704 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc9d1\uc911\uc801\uc778 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ubd84\ud560 \uc815\ubcf5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae4a\uc740 \uc870\ud569 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc5ec, \uae4a\uc774 100\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1(F1- \uc810\uc218 = 1.0)\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this work, we use mechanistic interpretability to causally investigate the internal representations of a neural speech decoder. We perform cross-mode activation patching of internal activations across speech modes, and use tri-modal interpolation to examine whether speech representations vary discretely or continuously. We use coarse-to-fine causal tracing and causal scrubbing to find localized causal structure, allowing us to find internal subspaces that are sufficient for cross-mode transfer. In order to determine how finely distributed these effects are within layers, we perform neuron-level activation patching. We discover that small but not distributed subsets of neurons, rather than isolated units, affect the cross-mode transfer. Our results show that speech modes lie on a shared continuous causal manifold, and cross-mode transfer is mediated by compact, layer-specific subspaces rather than diffuse activity. Together, our findings give a causal explanation for how speech modality information is organized and used in brain-to-speech decoding models, revealing hierarchical and direction-dependent representational structure across speech modes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc74c\uc131 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uc778\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc74c\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc591\uc2dd \uac04\uc5d0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ub35c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc74c\uc131 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc758 \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud328\uce6d \ubc0f \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \ubcf4\uac04\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc74c\uc131 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8\uc758, \ubd84\uc0b0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub274\ub7f0\uc758 \uc11c\ube0c\uc14b\uc774 \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc804\uc774\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc74c\uc131 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub294 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc6d0\uc778 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc \uc704\uc5d0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uba70, \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc804\uc774\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud65c\ub3d9\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc, \uc751\uc9d1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uce35 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \uc11c\ube0c\uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub9e4\uac1c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub1cc-\uc74c\uc131 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubc1c\uc74c\ub41c, \ubab8\uc9d3\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c, \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub41c \uc74c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc74c\uc131 \uc591\uc2dd \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ub35c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uacbd \uc74c\uc131 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc6d0\uc778\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc74c\uc131 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub85c \ud328\uce58\ud558\uace0, \uc0bc\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubcf4\uac04\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc74c\uc131 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uc774\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub610\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac70\uce60\uac8c\ubd80\ud130 \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc6d0\uc778 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc6d0\uc778 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub7fd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6d\uc18c\uc801\uc778 \uc6d0\uc778 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucc3e\uc544\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc804\uc774\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc11c\ube0c\uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub274\ub7f0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud328\uce6d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \uc720\ub2db\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc, \uc791\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubd84\uc0b0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub274\ub7f0\uc758 \uc11c\ube0c\uc14b\uc774 \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc804\uc774\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc74c\uc131 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uac00 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc6d0\uc778 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc \uc704\uc5d0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc804\uc774\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc751\uc9d1\ub825 \uc788\ub294, \uce35\ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \uc11c\ube0c\uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub9e4\uac1c\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing systems often struggle to generalize across heterogeneous health data modalities, rely heavily on predefined solution templates with insufficient adaptation to task-specific objectives, and largely overlook uncertainty estimation, which is essential for reliable decision-making in healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose \\textit{AutoHealth}, a novel uncertainty-aware multi-agent system that autonomously models health data and assesses model reliability. \\textit{AutoHealth} employs closed-loop coordination among five specialized agents to perform data exploration, task-conditioned model construction, training, and optimization, while jointly prioritizing predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Beyond producing ready-to-use models, the system generates comprehensive reports to support trustworthy interpretation and risk-aware decision-making. To rigorously evaluate its effectiveness, we curate a challenging real-world benchmark comprising 17 tasks across diverse data modalities and learning settings. \\textit{AutoHealth} completes all tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 29.2\\% in prediction performance and 50.2\\% in uncertainty estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoHealth\ub294 \uac74\uac15 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac74\uac15 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "AutoHealth\ub294 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc870\uac74\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378 \uad6c\ucd95, \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AutoHealth\ub294 17\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc591\uc2dd \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c 29.2%\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc 50.2%\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud574\uc11d\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac74\uac15 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uac74\uac15 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc591\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0, \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc5d0 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac74\uac15 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 AutoHealth\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Model-based reinforcement learning offers a promising path to improved sample efficiency through world models, but standard monolithic architectures struggle to capture diverse task dynamics, resulting in poor reconstruction and prediction accuracy. We introduce Mixture-of-World Models (MoW), a scalable architecture that combines modular variational autoencoders for task-adaptive visual compression, a hybrid Transformer-based dynamics model with task-conditioned experts and a shared backbone, and a gradient-based task clustering strategy for efficient parameter allocation. On the Atari 100k benchmark, a single MoW agent trained once on 26 Atari games achieves a mean human-normalized score of 110.4%, competitive with the score of 114.2% achieved by STORM, an ensemble of 26 task-specific models, while using 50% fewer parameters. On Meta-World, MoW achieves a 74.5% average success rate within 300 thousand environment steps, establishing a new state of the art.

However, transforming high-level intents -- such as ultra-low latency, high throughput, or energy efficiency -- into concrete control actions (i.e., low-level actuator commands) remains beyond the capability of existing heuristic approaches. This work introduces an Agentic AI system for intent-driven autonomous networks, structured around three specialized agents. A supervisory interpreter agent, powered by language models, performs both lexical parsing of intents into executable optimization templates and cognitive refinement based on feedback, constraint feasibility, and evolving network conditions. An optimizer agent converts these templates into tractable optimization problems, analyzes trade-offs, and derives preferences across objectives. Lastly, a preference-driven controller agent, based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, leverages these preferences to operate near the Pareto frontier of network performance that best satisfies the original intent. Collectively, these agents enable networks to autonomously interpret, reason over, adapt to, and act upon diverse intents and network conditions in a scalable manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

Automotive manufacturers use Boolean combinations of these codes, called error patterns (EPs), to characterize system faults and ensure vehicle safety. Yet, EP rules are still manually handcrafted by domain experts, a process that is expensive and prone to errors as vehicle complexity grows. This paper introduces CAREP (Causal Automated Reasoning for Error Patterns), a multi-agent system that automatizes the generation of EP rules from high-dimensional event sequences of DTCs. CAREP combines a causal discovery agent that identifies potential DTC-EP relations, a contextual information agent that integrates metadata and descriptions, and an orchestrator agent that synthesizes candidate boolean rules together with interpretable reasoning traces. Evaluation on a large-scale automotive dataset with over 29,100 unique DTCs and 474 error patterns demonstrates that CAREP can automatically and accurately discover the unknown EP rules, outperforming LLM-only baselines while providing transparent causal explanations.

However, they underestimate epistemic uncertainty because they apply a Bayesian treatment only to the final layer, ignoring uncertainty induced by earlier layers. We propose a method that improves BLLs by leveraging a projection of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) features onto the space spanned by the last-layer features. This enables posterior inference that accounts for variability of the full network while retaining the low computational cost of inference of a standard BLL. We show that our method yields posterior variances that are provably greater or equal to those of a standard BLL, correcting its tendency to underestimate epistemic uncertainty. To further reduce computational cost, we introduce a uniform subsampling scheme for estimating the projection matrix and for posterior inference. We derive approximation bounds for both types of sub-sampling. Empirical evaluations on UCI regression, contextual bandits, image classification, and out-of-distribution detection tasks in image and tabular datasets, demonstrate improved calibration and uncertainty estimates compared to standard BLLs and competitive baselines, while reducing computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Bayesian Last Layers (BLLs)\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 BLLs\ub294 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uce35\uc5d0\ub9cc \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd08\uae30 \uce35\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uacfc\uc18c\ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158\uc744 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uce35 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc2a4\ud32c\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec BLLs\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 BLL\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud06c\uac70\ub098 \uac19\uc740 \ud6c4\ubc29 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uacfc\uc18c\ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 UCI \ud68c\uadc0, \ub9e5\ub77d \ubc34\ub527, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \ud45c\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 BLL \ubc0f \uacbd\uc7c1 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ubcf4\uc815 \ubc0f \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uce35(BLLs)\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud3b8\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 BLLs\ub294 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uce35\uc5d0\ub9cc \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd08\uae30 \uce35\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uacfc\uc18c\ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uce35 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc2a4\ud32c\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec BLLs\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 BLL\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ud6c4\ubc29 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 BLL\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud06c\uac70\ub098 \uac19\uc740 \ud6c4\ubc29 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uacfc\uc18c\ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158 \ud589\ub82c\uacfc \ud6c4\ubc29 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uc11c\ube0c\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uc885\ub958\uc758 \uc11c\ube0c\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadfc\uc0ac \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

It evaluates systems that translate natural-language problems into Answer Set Programs (ASPs), a prominent form of logic programming. It provides systematic coverage of ASP features, including choice rules, aggregates, and optimization. Each problem includes reference validators that check whether solutions satisfy the problem specification.\n  We characterize problems along seven largely independent reasoning aspects (optimization, temporal reasoning, default logic, resource allocation, recursion, spatial reasoning, and quantitative complexity), providing a multidimensional view of modeling difficulty.\n  We test the benchmark using an agentic approach based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) framework, which achieves full saturation, demonstrating that feedback-driven iterative refinement with solver feedback provides a reliable and robust approach for modeling natural language in ASP. Our analysis across multiple agent runs enables us to gain insights into what determines a problem's modeling hardness.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASP-Bench\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub85c\uc9c1 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uba85\uc138\ub97c \ub85c\uc9c1 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc0c1\uc9d5 \uacf5\ud559\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "128\uac1c\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c ASP-Bench \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, ReAct(Reason and Act) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 ASP\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uba85\uc138\ub97c \ub17c\ub9ac \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc0c1\uc9d5 \uacf5\ud559\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 128\uac1c\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc640 \uc26c\uc6b4 \ubcc0\ud615 \ubc0f \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubcc0\ud615\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c 64\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 ASP-Bench\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc751\ub2f5 \uc9d1\ud569 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8(ASP)\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The widely used TRAK algorithm addresses this challenge by first approximating the underlying model with a kernel machine and then leveraging techniques developed for approximating the leave-one-out (ALO) risk. Despite its strong empirical performance, the theoretical conditions under which the TRAK approximations are accurate as well as the regimes in which they break down remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of the TRAK algorithm, characterizing its performance and quantifying the errors introduced by the approximations on which the method relies. We show that although the approximations incur significant errors, TRAK's estimated influence remains highly correlated with the original influence and therefore largely preserves the relative ranking of data points.

However, existing workflow optimization methods typically formulate workflow synthesis as a static, one-shot code-centric generation problem. This paradigm imposes excessive constraints on the model's coding capabilities and restricts the flexibility required for dynamic problem-solving. In this paper, we present Workflow-R1, a framework that reformulates workflow construction as a multi-turn, natural language-based sequential decision-making process. To resolve the optimization granularity mismatch inherent in such multi-turn interactions, we introduce Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization (GSsPO). While explicitly tailored to align with the interleaved Think-Action dynamics of agentic reasoning, GSsPO fundamentally functions as a structure-aware RL algorithm generalizable to a broad class of multi-turn agentic sequential decision-making tasks. By recalibrating the optimization unit to the composite sub-sequence, specifically the atomic Think-Action cycle, it aligns gradient updates with the semantic boundaries of these interactions, ensuring robust learning in complex multi-turn reasoning tasks. Through extensive experiments on multiple QA benchmarks, Workflow-R1 outperforms competitive baselines, validating GSsPO as a generalized solution for sequential reasoning and establishing Workflow-R1 as a promising new paradigm for automated workflow optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucf54\ub4dc \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\ud45c\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucf54\ub529 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Workflow-R1\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, GSsPO(Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c QA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Workflow-R1\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uace0, GSsPO\ub97c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Workflow-R1\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucf54\ub4dc \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\ud45c\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucf54\ub529 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 Workflow-R1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GSsPO(Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, its exact computation is generally intractable, necessitating efficient approximation methods. While the most effective and popular estimators leverage the paired sampling heuristic to reduce estimation error, the theoretical mechanism driving this improvement has remained opaque. In this work, we provide an elegant and fundamental justification for paired sampling: we prove that the Shapley value depends exclusively on the odd component of the set function, and that paired sampling orthogonalizes the regression objective to filter out the irrelevant even component. Leveraging this insight, we propose OddSHAP, a novel consistent estimator that performs polynomial regression solely on the odd subspace. By utilizing the Fourier basis to isolate this subspace and employing a proxy model to identify high-impact interactions, OddSHAP overcomes the combinatorial explosion of higher-order approximations. Through an extensive benchmark evaluation, we find that OddSHAP achieves state-of-the-art estimation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "OddSHAP\ub294 Shapley \uac12\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ucd94\uc815 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Shapley \uac12\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uadfc\uc0ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "OddSHAP\ub294 \ud640\uc218 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ud56d \ud68c\uadc0\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \ud574\ub2f9 \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "OddSHAP\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ucd94\uc815 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "OddSHAP\ub294 Shapley \uac12\uc758 \ud640\uc218 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Shapley \uac12\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc131 \uc911\uc694\uc131, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uce58 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uadc0\uc18d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uadfc\uc0ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\uc815\ub7c9\uc740 \ucd94\uc815 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc30d \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc774\ub044\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc30d \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\uc544\ud558\uace0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Shapley \uac12\uc774 \uc9d1\ud569 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud640\uc218 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0, \uc30d \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc774 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc9c1\uad50\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc9dd\uc218 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud640\uc218 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ud56d \ud68c\uadc0\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ucd94\uc815\uae30 OddSHAP\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, OddSHAP\uc740 \uace0\ucc28 \uadfc\uc0ac\uc758 \uc870\ud569 \ud3ed\ubc1c\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 OddSHAP\uc774 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ucd94\uc815 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In such settings, single-agent systems are vulnerable to self-reinforcing errors, as their predictions lack independent validation and can drift toward spurious conclusions. Although recent multi-agent frameworks attempt to mitigate this issue through collaborative reasoning, their interactions are often shallow and loosely structured, failing to reflect the rigorous, evidence-driven processes used by clinical experts. More fundamentally, existing approaches largely ignore the rich logical dependencies among diseases, such as mutual exclusivity, pathological compatibility, and diagnostic confusion. This limitation prevents them from ruling out clinically implausible hypotheses, even when sufficient evidence is available. To overcome these, we propose RE-MCDF, a relation-enhanced multi-expert clinical diagnosis framework. RE-MCDF introduces a generation--verification--revision closed-loop architecture that integrates three complementary components: (i) a primary expert that generates candidate diagnoses and supporting evidence, (ii) a laboratory expert that dynamically prioritizes heterogeneous clinical indicators, and (iii) a multi-relation awareness and evaluation expert group that explicitly enforces inter-disease logical constraints. Guided by a medical knowledge graph (MKG), the first two experts adaptively reweight EMR evidence, while the expert group validates and corrects candidate diagnoses to ensure logical consistency. Extensive experiments on the neurology subset of CMEMR (NEEMRs) and on our curated dataset (XMEMRs) demonstrate that RE-MCDF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in complex diagnostic scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "RE-MCDF\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uacbd\ud559\uc801 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, EMR\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ud559\uc801 \uc804\uc790 \uc758\ubb34 \uae30\ub85d(EMR)\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uba70 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "RE-MCDF\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131-\uac80\uc99d-\uc218\uc815\uc758 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc \uc804\ubb38\uac00, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc2e4 \uc804\ubb38\uac00, \ub2e4\uc911 \uad00\uacc4 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "NEEMRs \ubc0f XMEMRs \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 RE-MCDF\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RE-MCDF\ub294 \uc758\ud559\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504(MKG)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ub418\uba70, EMR \uc99d\uac70\uc758 \uc7ac\uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\uc790 \uc758\ubb34 \uae30\ub85d(EMR), \ud2b9\ud788 \uc2e0\uacbd\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c, \ubcf8\ub798 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uba70 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0\uac8c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc99d \uc5c6\uc774 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc790\uae30 \uac15\ud654 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uacb0\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \ud750\ub97c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc595\uace0 \ub290\uc2a8\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ucca0\uc800\ud558\uace0 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubc30\ud0c0\uc131, \ubcd1\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \ud638\ud658\uc131, \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud63c\ub3d9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uac04\uc758 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc784\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\uc740 \uac00\uc124\uc744 \ubc30\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad00\uacc4 \uac15\ud654 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RE-MCDF\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We focus on a tabular finite-horizon MDP and adopt a phased learning framework. In each learning phase, multiple agents independently interact with the environment. More specifically, in each learning phase, each agent is assigned a policy, executes it, and observes the resulting trajectory. Our primary goal is to characterize the tradeoff between the number of learning phases and the number of agents, especially when the number of learning phases is small.\n  Our results identify a sharp transition governed by the horizon $H$. When the number of learning phases equals $H$, we present a computationally efficient algorithm that uses only $\\tilde{O}(S^6 H^6 A / \u03b5^2)$ agents to obtain an $\u03b5$ approximation of the dynamics (i.e., yields an $\u03b5$-optimal policy for any reward function). We complement our algorithm with a lower bound showing that any algorithm restricted to $\u03c1< H$ phases requires at least $A^{H/\u03c1}$ agents to achieve constant accuracy. Thus, we show that it is essential to have an order of $H$ learning phases if we limit the number of agents to be polynomial.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud611\ub3d9 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc758 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud568\uaed8 \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 MDP\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud55c \ud6c4 \uacb0\uacfc \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uac00 \uc218\ud3c9\uc120 $H$\uc640 \uac19\uc744 \ub54c, \ub3d9\uc801\uc758 $\u03b5$ \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574 $\tilde{O}(S^6 H^6 A / \u03b5^2)$ \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\ub97c \ub2e4\ud56d\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud588\uc744 \ub54c $H$ \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub3d9 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 MDP\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4(\ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0). \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud14c\uc774\ube14\ud615 \uc720\ud55c \uc218\ud3c9 MDP\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub354 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uac01 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud560\ub2f9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud55c \ud6c4 \uacb0\uacfc \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uac00 \uc801\uc744 \ub54c. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc218\ud3c9\uc120 $H$\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\ub294 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uac00 $H$\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud560 \ub54c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc758 $\u03b5$ \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574 $\tilde{O}(S^6 H^6 A / \u03b5^2)$ \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub9cc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ud558\ud55c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uc5ec, $\u03c1< H$ \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc5b4\ub5a0\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ub3c4 \uc77c\uc815\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c $A^{H/\u03c1}$ \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\ub97c \ub2e4\ud56d\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0, $H$ \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Unlike ordinary question answering, aggregate queries require exhaustive evidence collection and systems are required to \"find all,\" not merely \"find one.\" Existing paradigms such as Text-to-SQL and Retrieval-Augmented Generation fail to achieve this completeness. In this work, we formalize entity-level aggregation querying over text in a corpus-bounded setting with strict completeness requirement. To enable principled evaluation, we introduce AGGBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate completeness-oriented aggregation under realistic large-scale corpus. To accompany the benchmark, we propose DFA (Disambiguation--Filtering--Aggregation), a modular agentic baseline that decomposes aggregation querying into interpretable stages and exposes key failure modes related to ambiguity, filtering, and aggregation. Empirical results show that DFA consistently improves aggregation evidence coverage over strong RAG and agentic baselines.

Though the straight-forward ''best-of-$N$'' (BoN) strategy has already demonstrated significant improvements in performance, it lacks principled guidance on the choice of $N$, budget allocation, and multi-stage decision-making, thereby leaving substantial room for optimization. While many works have explored such optimization, rigorous theoretical guarantees remain limited. In this work, we propose new methodologies to predict and improve scaling properties via tail-guided search. By estimating the tail distribution of rewards, our method predicts the scaling law of LLMs without the need for exhaustive evaluations. Leveraging this prediction tool, we introduce Scaling-Law Guided (SLG) Search, a new test-time algorithm that dynamically allocates compute to identify and exploit intermediate states with the highest predicted potential. We theoretically prove that SLG achieves vanishing regret compared to perfect-information oracles, and achieves expected rewards that would otherwise require a polynomially larger compute budget required when using BoN. Empirically, we validate our framework across different LLMs and reward models, confirming that tail-guided allocation consistently achieves higher reward yields than Best-of-$N$ under identical compute budgets.

Bonilla"], "title": "Multi-Scale Wavelet Transformers for Operator Learning of Dynamical Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent years have seen a surge in data-driven surrogates for dynamical systems that can be orders of magnitude faster than numerical solvers. However, many machine learning-based models such as neural operators exhibit spectral bias, attenuating high-frequency components that often encode small-scale structure. This limitation is particularly damaging in applications such as weather forecasting, where misrepresented high frequencies can induce long-horizon instability. To address this issue, we propose multi-scale wavelet transformers (MSWTs), which learn system dynamics in a tokenized wavelet domain. The wavelet transform explicitly separates low- and high-frequency content across scales. MSWTs leverage a wavelet-preserving downsampling scheme that retains high-frequency features and employ wavelet-based attention to capture dependencies across scales and frequency bands. Experiments on chaotic dynamical systems show substantial error reductions and improved long horizon spectral fidelity. On the ERA5 climate reanalysis, MSWTs further reduce climatological bias, demonstrating their effectiveness in a real-world forecasting setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ube60\ub974\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uacc4\ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \uc131\ubd84\uc744 \uc65c\uace1\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uc6e8\uc774\ube0c\ub81b \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4\ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \uc131\ubd84\uc744 \uc65c\uace1\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6e8\uc774\ube0c\ub81b \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c\uc640 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uacfc \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub300\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud63c\ub3c8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub958 \uac10\uc18c\uc640 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc7a5\uae30 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ERA5 \uae30\ud6c4 \uc7ac\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ud6c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc608\uce21 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc218\uce58 \ud574\uc11d\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc218 \ubc30 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ub9ac\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc885\uc885 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \uc131\ubd84\uc744 \uc57d\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \uc798\ubabb \ud45c\ud604\ub41c \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c\uac00 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \ud574\ub86d\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud1a0\ud070\ud654\ub41c \uc6e8\uc774\ube0c\ub81b \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uc6e8\uc774\ube0c\ub81b \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(MSWT)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6e8\uc774\ube0c\ub81b \ubcc0\ud658\uc740 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c\uc640 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.

In contrast, real-world software development is organized as a collaborative activity carried out by teams following shared methodologies, with clear role separation, communication, and review. In this work, we present a fully automated multi-agent system that explicitly models software engineering as an organizational process, replicating the structure of an engineering team. Built on top of agyn, an open-source platform for configuring agent teams, our system assigns specialized agents to roles such as coordination, research, implementation, and review, provides them with isolated sandboxes for experimentation, and enables structured communication. The system follows a defined development methodology for working on issues, including analysis, task specification, pull request creation, and iterative review, and operates without any human intervention. Importantly, the system was designed for real production use and was not tuned for SWE-bench. When evaluated post hoc on SWE-bench 500, it resolves 72.4% of tasks, outperforming single-agent baselines using comparable language models. Our results suggest that replicating team structure, methodology, and communication is a powerful paradigm for autonomous software engineering, and that future progress may depend as much on organizational design and agent infrastructure as on model improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1

However, overfitting remains a challenge that limits its broader applicability. To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength. Furthermore, to mitigate manifold intrusion-where data augmentation may generate unrealistic samples that fall outside the data manifold-we propose a manifold intrusion detection mechanism. Experimental results on 58 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Jensen gap minimization compared to other complexity measures. Comparisons with 15 machine learning algorithms further indicate that genetic programming with the proposed overfitting control strategy achieves superior performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc720\uc804

In this work, we study how implicit bias, defined as subtle statistical prejudice, accumulates and propagates within LLMs equipped with long-term memory. To support systematic analysis, we introduce the Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) Benchmark, a large-scale dataset comprising 3,776 decision-making scenarios across nine social domains, designed to quantify implicit bias in long-term decision processes. Using a realistic long-horizon simulation framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs integrated with three representative memory architectures on DIB and demonstrate that LLMs' implicit bias does not remain static but intensifies over time and propagates across unrelated domains. We further analyze mitigation strategies and show that a static system-level prompting baseline provides limited and short-lived debiasing effects. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT), an agentic intervention that enforces fairness constraints at memory write time. Extensive experimental results show that DMT substantially reduces bias accumulation and effectively curtails cross-domain bias propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ucd95\uc801\ub418\uace0 \uc804\ud30c\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc591\uc801\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc131\uacfc \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac15\ud574\uc9c0\uba70 \uad00\uacc4 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc804\ud30c\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DMT\ub77c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud0dc\uae45 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ucd95\uc801\uc744 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131\uacfc \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uae30\ub3c4 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud3b8\uacac\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub418\ub294 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 LLM \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ucd95\uc801\ub418\uace0 \uc804\ud30c\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 9\uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 3,776\uac1c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc778 Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM\uc744 DIB\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2ec\ud654\ub418\uba70 \uad00\uacc4 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc804\ud30c\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uc644\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc815\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub808\ubca8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e8\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc81c\uac70 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub9cc \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc5b5 \uae30\ub85d \uc2dc \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 DMT(Dynamic Memory Tagging)\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 DMT\uac00 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ucd95\uc801\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Many current systems rely on brittle heuristics or indiscriminate long reasoning, which offers little control over the benefit-burden tradeoff. We formulate the problem as cost-sensitive selective intervention and present PRISM, a novel framework that couples a decision-theoretic gate with a dual-process reasoning architecture. At inference time, the agent intervenes only when a calibrated probability of user acceptance exceeds a threshold derived from asymmetric costs of missed help and false alarms. Inspired by festina lente (Latin: \"make haste slowly\"), we gate by an acceptance-calibrated, cost-derived threshold and invoke a resource-intensive Slow mode with counterfactual checks only near the decision boundary, concentrating computation on ambiguous and high-stakes cases. Training uses gate-aligned, schema-locked distillation: a teacher running the full PRISM pipeline provides dense, executable supervision on unlabeled interaction traces, while the student learns a response policy that is explicitly decoupled from the intervention gate to enable tunable and auditable control. On ProactiveBench, PRISM reduces false alarms by 22.78% and improves F1 by 20.14% over strong baselines. These results show that principled decision-theoretic gating, paired with selective slow reasoning and aligned distillation, yields proactive agents that are precise, computationally efficient, and controllable. To facilitate reproducibility, we release our code, models, and resources at https://prism-festinalente.github.io/; all experiments use the open-source ProactiveBench benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubbfc\uac10 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uac1c\uc785 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc774\ub860 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \uc774\uc911 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ub610\ub294 \ubb34\ucc28\ubcc4\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uae30 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc774\uc775-\ubd80\ub2f4 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "PRISM\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc774\ub860 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \uc774\uc911 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc544\ud0a4\ud0dd\ucc98\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec, \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ud78c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc218\uc6a9 \ud655\ub960\uc774 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ube44\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub41c \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \ub54c\ub9cc \uac1c\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PRISM\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ub300\ube44 \ud5c8\uc704 \uacbd\uace0\ub97c 22.78% \uc904\uc774\uace0 F1 \uc2a4\ucf54\uc5b4\ub97c 20.14% \uac1c\uc120\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PRISM\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubbfc\uac10 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ub290\ub9b0 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2a5\ub3d9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \ub9d0\ud560\uc9c0\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uac1c\uc785\ud560\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc5b8\uc81c \uac1c\uc785\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc774\ub098 \ubb34\ucc28\ubcc4\uc801\uc778 \uae34 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774\uc775-\ubd80\ub2f4 \uade0\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac70\uc758 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ube44\uc6a9 \ubbfc\uac10 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uac1c\uc785\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \uc774\uc911 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 PRISM\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc218\uc6a9 \ud655\ub960\uc774 \ub193\uce5c \ub3c4\uc6c0\uacfc \ud5c8\uc704 \uacbd\uace0\uc758 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \ub54c\ub9cc \uac1c\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc

Because both mechanisms can yield identical task success on the original interface, benchmark scores alone are not identifiable evidence of environment-invariant capability. We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable. We further introduce Interface Reliance (IR), a counterbalanced alias-based metric that quantifies preference for training-time interfaces, and show that interface shortcutting exhibits environment-dependent, non-monotonic training dynamics that remain invisible under standard evaluation.

To address these issues, in this work, we propose S1-NexusAgent, a self-evolving agent framework designed for multidisciplinary scientific research. S1-NexusAgent adopts a hierarchical Plan-and-CodeAct execution paradigm, decoupling global scientific planning from subtask-level tool execution through a dual-loop architecture, thereby enabling stable modeling of complex research workflows. The system natively supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), integrates up to thousands of cross-disciplinary scientific tools, and achieves efficient orchestration of heterogeneous research tools via intention-aware dynamic tool retrieval and hot-plug mechanisms. To address long-context and large-scale data challenges in scientific settings, S1-NexusAgent introduces object-reference-based sparse context management, which enables sub-task context isolation and intermediate result compression. Building on this, a Critic Agent automatically evaluates complete execution trajectories and distills high-quality research paths into reusable Scientific Skills, forming a closed loop for continuous self-evolution, which is valuable for sustainable and long-horizon scientific research.

One of the most common USD approaches is to maximize the Mutual Information (MI) between skill latent variables and states. However, MI-based methods tend to favor simple, static skills due to their invariance properties, limiting the discovery of dynamic, task-relevant behaviors. Distance-Maximizing Skill Discovery (DSD) promotes more dynamic skills by leveraging state-space distances, yet still fall short in encouraging comprehensive skill sets that engage all controllable factors or entities in the environment. In this work, we introduce SUSD, a novel framework that harnesses the compositional structure of environments by factorizing the state space into independent components (e.g., objects or controllable entities). SUSD allocates distinct skill variables to different factors, enabling more fine-grained control on the skill discovery process. A dynamic model also tracks learning across factors, adaptively steering the agent's focus toward underexplored factors. This structured approach not only promotes the discovery of richer and more diverse skills, but also yields a factorized skill representation that enables fine-grained and disentangled control over individual entities which facilitates efficient training of compositional downstream tasks via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our experimental results across three environments, with factors ranging from 1 to 10, demonstrate that our method can discover diverse and complex skills without supervision, significantly outperforming existing unsupervised skill discovery methods in factorized and complex environments.

However, most existing systems rely on predefined tasks and fixed prompts, limiting their ability to autonomously identify what problems should be solved when environmental conditions change. In this paper, we propose a human-simulation-based framework that enables AI systems to autonomously form questions and set tasks by reasoning over their internal states, environmental observations, and interactions with other AI systems. The proposed method treats question formation as a first-class decision process preceding task selection and execution, and integrates internal-driven, environment-aware, and inter-agent-aware prompting scopes to progressively expand cognitive coverage. In addition, the framework supports learning the question-formation process from experience, allowing the system to improve its adaptability and decision quality over time. xperimental results in a multi-agent simulation environment show that environment-aware prompting significantly reduces no-eat events compared with the internal-driven baseline, and inter-agent-aware prompting further reduces cumulative no-eat events by more than 60% over a 20-day simulation, with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744

Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a distribution-free framework for this task, yet its standard formulations rely on exchangeability assumptions that are violated by the distribution shifts inherent in real-world robotics. Existing online CP methods maintain target coverage by adaptively scaling the conformal threshold, but typically employ a static nonconformity score function. We show that this fixed geometry leads to highly conservative, volume-inefficient prediction regions when environments undergo structural shifts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{AdaptNC}, a framework for the joint online adaptation of both the nonconformity score parameters and the conformal threshold. AdaptNC leverages an adaptive reweighting scheme to optimize score functions, and introduces a replay buffer mechanism to mitigate the coverage instability that occurs during score transitions. We evaluate AdaptNC on diverse robotic benchmarks involving multi-agent policy changes, environmental changes and sensor degradation. Our results demonstrate that AdaptNC significantly reduces prediction region volume compared to state-of-the-art threshold-only baselines while maintaining target coverage levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \ube44\uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc810\uc218\uc640 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub85c\ubd07\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 AdaptNC \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AdaptNC\ub294 \ube44\uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc810\uc218 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc640 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \ud568\uaed8 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AdaptNC\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uc608\uce21 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \ubd80\ud53c\uac00 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e4\uba74\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc AdaptNC\uac00 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \ubd80\ud53c\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\ud615 \uc608\uce21(CP)\uc740 \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec \ube44\uc758\uc874\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud45c\uc900 \ud615\uc2dd\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub85c\ubd07 \uacf5\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc704\ubc30\ub418\ub294 \uad50\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 CP \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\ub840\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\ud615 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uace0\uc815 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uacaa\uc744 \ub54c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcfc\ub968 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc810\uc218 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc640 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AdaptNC\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Project page: http://flowsteer.org/", "summary": "In recent years, a variety of powerful agentic workflows have been applied to solve a wide range of human problems. However, existing workflow orchestration still faces key challenges, including high manual cost, reliance on specific operators/large language models (LLMs), and sparse reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose FlowSteer, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that takes a lightweight policy model as the agent and an executable canvas environment, automating workflow orchestration through multi-turn interaction. In this process, the policy model analyzes execution states and selects editing actions, while the canvas executes operators and returns feedback for iterative refinement. Moreover, FlowSteer provides a plug-and-play framework that supports diverse operator libraries and interchangeable LLM backends. To effectively train this interaction paradigm, we propose Canvas Workflow Relative Policy Optimization (CWRPO), which introduces diversity-constrained rewards with conditional release to stabilize learning and suppress shortcut behaviors.

The learner aims to recommend actions that perform well under the agent's true objective, and the performance is measured by the regret, defined as the cumulative gap between the agent's optimal values and those achieved by the learner's recommended actions. Prior work has established a regret bound of $O(d\\log T)$, as well as a finite but exponentially large bound of $\\exp(O(d\\log d))$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem and $T$ is the time horizon, while a regret lower bound of $\u03a9(d)$ is known (Gollapudi et al. 2021; Sakaue et al. 2025). Whether a finite regret bound polynomial in $d$ is achievable or not has remained an open question. We partially resolve this by showing that when the feasible sets are M-convex -- a broad class that includes matroids -- a finite regret bound of $O(d\\log d)$ is possible. We achieve this by combining a structural characterization of optimal solutions on M-convex sets with a geometric volume argument.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{TRIP-Bench}, a long-horizon benchmark grounded in realistic travel-planning scenarios. TRIP-Bench leverages real-world data, offers 18 curated tools and 40+ travel requirements, and supports automated evaluation. It includes splits of varying difficulty; the hard split emphasizes long and ambiguous interactions, style shifts, feasibility changes, and iterative version revision. Dialogues span up to 15 user turns, can involve 150+ tool calls, and may exceed 200k tokens of context. Experiments show that even advanced models achieve at most 50\\% success on the easy split, with performance dropping below 10\\% on hard subsets. We further propose \\textbf{GTPO}, an online multi-turn reinforcement learning method with specialized reward normalization and reward differencing. Applied to Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GTPO improves constraint satisfaction and interaction robustness, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro in our evaluation.

To overcome this, we introduce the Collaborative Memory Transformer (CoMeT), a novel architecture that enables LLMs to handle arbitrarily long sequences with constant memory usage and linear time complexity. Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies. These memories then act as a dynamic soft prompt for the next chunk. To enable efficient fine-tuning on extremely long contexts, we introduce a novel layer-level pipeline parallelism strategy. The effectiveness of our approach is remarkable: a model equipped with CoMeT and fine-tuned on 32k contexts can accurately retrieve a passkey from any position within a 1M token sequence. On the SCROLLS benchmark, CoMeT surpasses other efficient methods and achieves performance comparable to a full-attention baseline on summarization tasks. Its practical effectiveness is further validated on real-world agent and user behavior QA tasks.

However, many existing systems rely on stochastic routing or ad-hoc heuristics, making their behavior difficult to reproduce and their decision process hard to interpret. We propose ORCH, a deterministic coordination framework for discrete-choice reasoning that orchestrates heterogeneous LLMs. ORCH follows a ``many analyses, one decision'' paradigm: multiple base models independently produce structured analyses, and a dedicated merge agent outputs the final choice. The framework uses fixed rules for task decomposition and answer aggregation, keeping the pipeline predictable, reproducible, and training-free. Determinism here refers to fixed routing and aggregation rules under a fixed evaluation protocol, rather than strict bit-level reproducibility across deployments. To exploit model complementarity, we optionally introduce an EMA-guided router that updates agent selection using historical accuracy, latency, or cost; since it relies on answer-based feedback, it is mainly intended for benchmarking, controlled evaluation, or delayed-feedback settings. Experiments on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GSM8K show that ORCH consistently outperforms single-model baselines and a majority-vote ensemble. On MMLU-Pro, ORCH improves accuracy by over 10 points compared to the strongest baseline, and on GSM8K it yields gains exceeding 50 points; McNemar tests confirm statistical significance. The EMA router provides an additional 0.7--2.0 point accuracy boost, and ablations show that both multi-agent collaboration and routing contribute substantially. Overall, ORCH offers a practical path toward controllable, interpretable, and deployment-ready LLM-based agent systems for discrete-choice reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "ORCH\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc801 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ucd9c\ub825\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ORCH\ub294 '\ub9ce\uc740 \ubd84\uc11d, \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uacb0\uc815' \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub530\ub974\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ub2f4 \ubcd1\ud569 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ucd9c\ub825\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ORCH\ub294 MMLU, MMLU-Pro \ubc0f GSM8K\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\uc900\uacfc \ub2e4\uc218 \ud22c\ud45c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70, MMLU-Pro\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 10\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc774\uc0c1 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ORCH\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5\uacfc \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uc774\ub098 \uc784\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \ud798\ub4e4\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 LLM\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc801 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ORCH\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

While this paradigm has driven substantial progress, it proves insufficient in adaptive and multi-turn settings where forecasting requires informative feature extraction, reasoning-driven inference, iterative refinement, and continual adaptation over time. In this paper, we argue for agentic time series forecasting (ATSF), which reframes forecasting as an agentic process composed of perception, planning, action, reflection, and memory. Rather than focusing solely on predictive models, ATSF emphasizes organizing forecasting as an agentic workflow that can interact with tools, incorporate feedback from outcomes, and evolve through experience accumulation. We outline three representative implementation paradigms -- workflow-based design, agentic reinforcement learning, and a hybrid agentic workflow paradigm -- and discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise when shifting from model-centric prediction to agentic forecasting. Together, this position aims to establish agentic forecasting as a foundation for future research at the intersection of time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21(ATSF)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucd94\ucd9c \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ATSF\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc778\uc9c0, \uacc4\ud68d, \ud589\ub3d9, \ubc18\uc131 \ubc0f \uae30\uc5b5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ATSF\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uba70 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd95\uc801\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubc1c\uc804\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub85c ATSF\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacfc\uac70 \uad00\uce21\uce58\ub97c \ubbf8\ub798 \uac12\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud1b5\uacfc \uc608\uce21 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4\uc654\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ucd94\ucd9c, \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucd94\ub860, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc778\uc9c0, \uacc4\ud68d, \ud589\ub3d9, \ubc18\uc131 \ubc0f \uae30\uc5b5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21(ATSF)\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.

To differentiate agent behavior in the multi-agent system, current frameworks typically assign generic role-based personas such as ''reviewer'' or ''writer'' or rely on coarse grained keyword-based personas. While functional, this approach oversimplifies how human scientists operate, whose contributions are shaped by their unique research trajectories. In response, we propose INDIBATOR, a framework for molecular discovery that grounds agents in individualized scientist profiles constructed from two modalities: publication history for literature-derived knowledge and molecular history for structural priors. These agents engage in multi-turn debate through proposal, critique, and voting phases. Our evaluation demonstrates that these fine-grained individuality-grounded agents consistently outperform systems relying on coarse-grained personas, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art performance.

Amintoosi"], "title": "Stein-Rule Shrinkage for Stochastic Gradient Estimation in High Dimensions", "comment": null, "summary": "Stochastic gradient methods are central to large-scale learning, yet their analysis typically treats mini-batch gradients as unbiased estimators of the population gradient. In high-dimensional settings, however, classical results from statistical decision theory show that unbiased estimators are generally inadmissible under quadratic loss, suggesting that standard stochastic gradients may be suboptimal from a risk perspective. In this work, we formulate stochastic gradient computation as a high-dimensional estimation problem and introduce a decision-theoretic framework based on Stein-rule shrinkage. We construct a shrinkage gradient estimator that adaptively contracts noisy mini-batch gradients toward a stable restricted estimator derived from historical momentum. The shrinkage intensity is determined in a data-driven manner using an online estimate of gradient noise variance, leveraging second-moment statistics commonly maintained by adaptive optimization methods. Under a Gaussian noise model and for dimension p>=3, we show that the proposed estimator uniformly dominates the standard stochastic gradient under squared error loss and is minimax-optimal in the classical decision-theoretic sense. We further demonstrate how this estimator can be incorporated into the Adam optimizer, yielding a practical algorithm with negligible additional computational cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, across multiple levels of label noise, show consistent improvements over Adam in the large-batch regime. Ablation studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from selectively applying shrinkage to high-dimensional convolutional layers, while indiscriminate shrinkage across all parameters degrades performance. These results illustrate that classical shrinkage principles provide a principled and effective approach to improving stochastic gradient estimation in modern deep learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

Recent efforts have sought to extend this paradigm to open-ended tasks by employing LLMs-as-a-Judge to provide sequence-level rewards for policy optimization. However, these rewards are inherently sparse, failing to provide the fine-grained supervision necessary for generating complex, long-form trajectories. Furthermore, current work treats the Judge as a black-box oracle, discarding the rich intermediate feedback signals encoded in it. To address these limitations, we introduce Grad2Reward, a novel framework that extracts dense process rewards directly from the Judge's model inference process via a single backward pass. By leveraging gradient-based attribution, Grad2Reward enables precise token-level credit assignment, substantially enhancing training efficiency and reasoning quality. Additionally, Grad2Reward introduces a self-judging mechanism, allowing the policy to improve through its own evaluative signals without training specialized reward models or reliance on superior external Judges. The experiments demonstrate that policies optimized with Grad2Reward achieve outstanding performance across diverse open-ended tasks, affirming its effectiveness and broad generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Grad2Reward\ub294 Judge \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc00\uc9d1 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\ub294 \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c breakthroughs\ub97c \ucd09\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Grad2Reward\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec Judge\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5ed\ubc29\ud5a5 \ud328\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc00\uc9d1 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Grad2Reward\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Grad2Reward\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc790\uac00 \ud3c9\uac00 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1(Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards, RLVR)\uc740 \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c breakthroughs\ub97c \ucd09\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub178\ub825\ub4e4\uc740 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc744 \ud310\uc0ac\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uae34 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud310\uc0ac\ub97c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc624\ub77c\ud074\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \uc548\uc5d0 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ub41c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc911\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Grad2Reward\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud310\uc0ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \ub4a4\ub85c \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc00\uc9d1 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uadc0\uc18d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 Grad2Reward\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud06c\ub808\ub527 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c Grad2Reward\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \ud3c9\uac00 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uace0\uae09 \uc678\ubd80 \ud310\uc0ac\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, Grad2Reward\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, retrieving and following these procedures presents unique challenges, such as rigid proprietary structures, condition-dependent relevance, and actionable execution requirement, which standard semantic-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms fail to address. Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, we propose SOPRAG, a novel framework specifically designed to address the above pain points in SOP retrieval. SOPRAG replaces flat chunking with specialized Entity, Causal, and Flow graph experts to resolve industrial structural and logical complexities. To optimize and coordinate these experts, we propose a Procedure Card layer that prunes the search space to eliminate computational noise, and an LLM-Guided gating mechanism that dynamically weights these experts to align retrieval with operator intent. To address the scarcity of domain-specific data, we also introduce an automated, multi-agent workflow for benchmark construction. Extensive experiments across four industrial domains demonstrate that SOPRAG significantly outperforms strong lexical, dense, and graph-based RAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response utility, achieving perfect execution scores in real-world critical tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SOPRAG\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5 SOP \uac80\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec SOP\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 SOP\uac00 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 SOP\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ub530\ub974\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "SOPRAG\ub294 \ud3c9\uba74\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \ud2b9\uc815\ud55c \uac1c\uccb4, \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4, \ud750\ub984 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubc0f \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 Procedure Card \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc640 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 LLM-Guided gating \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SOPRAG\ub294 \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c RAG \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc911\uc694 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SOPRAG\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5 SOP \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud45c\uc900 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc808\ucc28(SOP)\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc548\uc804\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ub530\ub974\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \ub3c5\uc810 \uad6c\uc870, \uc870\uac74 \uc758\uc874\uc801 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc758\ubbf8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG) \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud63c\ud569(Mixture-of-Experts, MoE) \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SOP \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SOPRAG\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper presents a novel, data-efficient deep learning framework designed to achieve precise and accurate control using minimal sensor hardware. Leveraging an external dataset of 8 subjects, our approach implements a hybrid Transformer optimized for sparse, two-channel surface electromyography (sEMG). Unlike standard architectures that use fixed positional encodings, we integrate Time2Vec learnable temporal embeddings to capture the stochastic temporal warping inherent in biological signals. Furthermore, we employ a normalized additive fusion strategy that aligns the latent distributions of spatial and temporal features, preventing the destructive interference common in standard implementations. A two-stage curriculum learning protocol is utilized to ensure robust feature extraction despite data scarcity. The proposed architecture achieves a state-of-the-art multi-subject F1-score of 95.7% $\\pm$ 0.20% for a 10-class movement set, statistically outperforming both a standard Transformer with fixed encodings and a recurrent CNN-LSTM model. Architectural optimization reveals that a balanced allocation of model capacity between spatial and temporal dimensions yields the highest stability. Furthermore, while direct transfer to a new unseen subject led to poor accuracy due to domain shifts, a rapid calibration protocol utilizing only two trials per gesture recovered performance from 21.0% $\\pm$ 2.98% to 96.9% $\\pm$ 0.52%. By validating that high-fidelity temporal embeddings can compensate for low spatial resolution, this work challenges the necessity of high-density sensing. The proposed framework offers a robust, cost-effective blueprint for next-generation prosthetic interfaces capable of rapid personalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc800\ube44\uc6a9 \uc13c\uc11c

This insufficient experience reuse leads to computational redundancy and execution instability. To bridge this gap, we propose ProcMEM, a framework that enables agents to autonomously learn procedural memory from interaction experiences without parameter updates. By formalizing a Skill-MDP, ProcMEM transforms passive episodic narratives into executable Skills defined by activation, execution, and termination conditions to ensure executability. To achieve reliable reusability without capability degradation, we introduce Non-Parametric PPO, which leverages semantic gradients for high-quality candidate generation and a PPO Gate for robust Skill verification. Through score-based maintenance, ProcMEM sustains compact, high-quality procedural memory. Experimental results across in-domain, cross-task, and cross-agent scenarios demonstrate that ProcMEM achieves superior reuse rates and significant performance gains with extreme memory compression. Visualized evolutionary trajectories and Skill distributions further reveal how ProcMEM transparently accumulates, refines, and reuses procedural knowledge to facilitate long-term autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud574 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uacfc \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 ProcMEM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354\uc6b1 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc758 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ProcMEM\uc740 Skill-MDP\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud328\uc2dc\ube0c \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub515 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c Skills\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, Non-Parametric PPO\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, Skill \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c PPO Gate\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ProcMEM\uc740 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ub960\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1, \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ProcMEM\uc740 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uac8c \ucd95\uc801, \uc815\uc81c \ubc0f \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc7ac\ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 ProcMEM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While prior work has integrated LLMs and VLMs into various components of RL, the replay buffer, a core component for storing and reusing experiences, remains unexplored. We propose addressing this gap by leveraging VLMs to guide the prioritization of experiences in the replay buffer. Our key idea is to use a frozen, pre-trained VLM (requiring no fine-tuning) as an automated evaluator to identify and prioritize promising sub-trajectories from the agent's experiences. Across scenarios, including game-playing and robotics, spanning both discrete and continuous domains, agents trained with our proposed prioritization method achieve 11-52% higher average success rates and improve sample efficiency by 19-45% compared to previous approaches. https://esharony.me/projects/vlm-rb/", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc7ac\uc0dd \ubc84\ud37c\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uacc4\ud68d, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc7ac\uc0dd \ubc84\ud37c \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uacfc\uac70 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 11-52% \ub354 \ub192\uace0 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 19-45% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc758 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc720\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs) \ubc0f \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLMs)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \ucc3d\ucd9c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c RL \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 LLM\uacfc VLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc778 \uc7ac\uc0dd \ubc84\ud37c\ub294 \uc544\uc9c1 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 VLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7ac\uc0dd \ubc84\ud37c\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub3d9\uacb0\ub41c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c VLM\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc0f \ub85c\ubd07\uacf5\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 11-52% \ub354 \ub192\uace0 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 19-45% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recognizing that the reasoning traces of LLMs encapsulate implicit problem-solving capabilities, we propose UCT, a novel training-free framework that transforms agents from tool users to tool creators. This approach harvests reasoning experiences and distills them into reusable assets. This method transforms the agent from a mere tool user into a tool creator, enabling adaptive tool creation and self-updating during the inference process. We also introduce a memory consolidation mechanism to maintain the tool library, ensuring high reusability of retained experiential memory for subsequent reasoning tasks. This novel automated tool construction paradigm continuously improves tool quality during reasoning, allowing the overall agent system to progress without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a novel paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of TIR models. In particular, the significant performance gains achieved +20.86%$\\uparrow$ and +23.04%$\\uparrow$ on benchmarks across multi-domain mathematical and scientific reasoning tasks validate the self-evolving capability of the agent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569 \ucd94\ub860(TIR) \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, LLM\uc744 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c \ucc3d\uc870\uc790\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c UCT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 TIR \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 LLM\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38-\uc751\ub2f5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 LLM\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc624\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "UCT\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c4\uad6c \ucc3d\uc870\uc790\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud1b5\ud569 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uba40\ud2f0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \uacfc\ud559 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c +20.86% \ubc0f +23.04%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 TIR \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\ub294\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569 \ucd94\ub860(TIR) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38-\uc751\ub2f5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud574\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5b4 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 LLM\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc624\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uae30\uc874 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \uad6c\ucd95\uc5d0\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub300\ud615

Existing approaches often rely on the parametric knowledge of a model or assume that patients provide rich and concrete information, which is unrealistic. To address these limitations, we propose a conversational diagnosis system that explores a diagnostic knowledge graph to reason in two steps: (i) generating diagnostic hypotheses from the dialogue context, and (ii) verifying hypotheses through clarifying questions, which are repeated until a final diagnosis is reached. Since evaluating the system requires a realistic patient simulator that responds to the system's questions, we adopt a well-established simulator along with patient profiles from MIMIC-IV. We further adapt it to describe symptoms vaguely to reflect real-world patients during early clinical encounters. Experiments show improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines, and evaluations by physicians support the realism of our simulator and the clinical utility of the generated questions.

This objective presents significant challenges, primarily due to the inherent distributional shift and value function overestimation bias. These issues become even more noticeable in zero-shot reinforcement learning, where an agent trained on reward-free data must adapt to new tasks at test time without additional training. In this work, we address the off-policy problem in a zero-shot setting by discovering a theoretical connection of successor measures to stationary density ratios. Using this insight, our algorithm can infer optimal importance sampling ratios, effectively performing a stationary distribution correction with an optimal policy for any task on the fly. We benchmark our method in motion tracking tasks on SMPL Humanoid, continuous control on ExoRL, and for the long-horizon OGBench tasks. Our technique seamlessly integrates into forward-backward representation frameworks and enables fast-adaptation to new tasks in a training-free regime.

To address this, we introduce the Canonical Intermediate Representation (CIR): a schema that LLMs explicitly generate between problem descriptions and optimization models. CIR encodes the semantics of operational rules through constraint archetypes and candidate modeling paradigms, thereby decoupling rule logic from its mathematical instantiation. Upon a newly generated CIR knowledge base, we develop the rule-to-constraint (R2C) framework, a multi-agent pipeline that parses problem texts, synthesizes CIR implementations by retrieving domain knowledge, and instantiates optimization models. To systematically evaluate rule-to-constraint reasoning, we test R2C on our newly constructed benchmark featuring rich operational rules, and benchmarks from prior work.

Existing attempts to bridge this gap primarily rely on retrieving successful past trajectories as demonstrations. However, this paradigm faces two critical limitations. First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights. Second, we propose a self-consolidation mechanism that distills non-parametric textual experience into compact learnable parameters.

However, many agentic architectures rely primarily on prompt engineering of a single agent, making it difficult to observe or compare how models handle uncertainty and coordination across interconnected decision stages and with human oversight. We introduce a multi-agent system formalized as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a directed acyclic structure. Each agent corresponds to a specific role or decision stage (e.g., content, business, or legal review in a compliance workflow), with predefined transitions representing task escalation or completion. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified at the agent level using Monte Carlo estimation, while system-level uncertainty is captured by the MDP's termination in either an automated labeled state or a human-review state. We illustrate the approach through a case study in AI safety evaluation for self-harm detection, implemented as a multi-agent compliance system. Results demonstrate improvements over a single-agent baseline, including up to a 19\\% increase in accuracy, up to an 85x reduction in required human review, and, in some configurations, reduced

To address these issues, we propose IntraSlice, a framework that applies block-wise module-intra PCA compression pruning. By leveraging the structural characteristics of Transformer modules, we design an approximate PCA method whose transformation matrices can be fully fused into the model without additional parameters. We also introduce a PCA-based global pruning ratio estimator that further considers the distribution of compressed activations, building on conventional module importance. We validate our method on Llama2, Llama3, and Phi series across various language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior compression performance compared to recent baselines at the same compression ratio or inference speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c IntraSlice \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud560 \ub54c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud06c\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "We propose IntraSlice framework that uses block-wise module-intra PCA compression pruning, allowing transformation matrices to be fully fused into the model without extra parameters.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Llama2, Llama3 \ubc0f Phi \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc555\ucd95 \ube44\uc728\uc774\ub098 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc555\ucd95 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "IntraSlice\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc555\ucd95\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc774\ub904\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ud06c\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\ub294 \uac00\uc18d\ud654 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 PCA \uae30\ubc18 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc794\uc5ec \uc5f0\uacb0\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \ud30c\uad34\ub418\uba70 \ubcc0\ud658 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \uc735\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \uac04\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube14\ub85d \ub2e8\uc704\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ub0b4\ubd80 PCA \uc555\ucd95 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 IntraSlice\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We term this investigatory intelligence, distinguishing it from executional intelligence, which merely completes assigned tasks. Data Science provides a natural testbed, as real-world analysis starts from raw data rather than explicit queries, yet few benchmarks focus on it. To address this, we introduce Deep Data Research (DDR), an open-ended task where LLMs autonomously extract key insights from databases, and DDR-Bench, a large-scale, checklist-based benchmark that enables verifiable evaluation.

A key result is the Exponential Suppression of Outlier Weights, ensuring that outliers contribute negligibly to computations, even in high-dimensional settings.

However, in long trajectories, agents often trigger excessive and low-quality tool calls, increasing latency and degrading inference performance, making managing tool-use behavior challenging. In this work, we conduct entropy-based pilot experiments and observe a strong positive correlation between entropy reduction and high-quality tool calls. Building on this finding, we propose using entropy reduction as a supervisory signal and design two reward strategies to address the differing needs of optimizing tool-use behavior. Sparse outcome rewards provide coarse, trajectory-level guidance to improve efficiency, while dense process rewards offer fine-grained supervision to enhance performance. Experiments across diverse domains show that both reward designs improve tool-use behavior: the former reduces tool calls by 72.07% compared to the average of baselines, while the latter improves performance by 22.27%. These results position entropy reduction as a key mechanism for enhancing tool-use behavior, enabling agents to be more adaptive in real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uac10\ub3c5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0 \ub300\ube44 72.07% \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ubc00\uc9d1 \uacfc\uc815 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 22.27% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uac10\uc18c\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uc558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uacb0\ud569 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae34 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \uc800\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ud589\ub3d9 \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud30c\uc77c\ub7ff \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uac10\uc18c\uc640 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uac04\uc758 \uac15\ud55c \uc591\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uac10\ub3c5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ud589\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac70\uce5c \uacbd\ub85c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ubc00\uc9d1 \uacfc\uc815 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub450 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc804\uc790\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \uae30\uc900 \ub300\ube44 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 72.07% \uc904\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud6c4\uc790\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 22.27% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\ub9e4\uae40\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To deepen the understanding between LLM's internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose a hypothesis on enhancing uncertainty estimation of CoT, which we validate that a small subset of CoT positions can effectively represent the uncertainty of the entire path. We further underscore the significance of exploiting CoT dynamics, and demonstrate that automatic recognition of CoT bypass can be achieved without performance degradation.

However, their practical deployment remains hindered by several limitations: sensitivity to prompt phrasing, ambiguity in semantic interpretation (e.g., ``mouse\" as animal vs. a computer peripheral), artifacts such as distorted anatomy, and the need for carefully engineered input prompts. Existing methods often require additional training and offer limited controllability, restricting their adaptability in real-world applications. We introduce Self-Improving Diffusion Agent (SIDiffAgent), a training-free agentic framework that leverages the Qwen family of models (Qwen-VL, Qwen-Image, Qwen-Edit, Qwen-Embedding) to address these challenges. SIDiffAgent autonomously manages prompt engineering, detects and corrects poor generations, and performs fine-grained artifact removal, yielding more reliable and consistent outputs. It further incorporates iterative self-improvement by storing a memory of previous experiences in a database. This database of past experiences is then used to inject prompt-based guidance at each stage of the agentic pipeline. \\modelour achieved an average VQA score of 0.884 on GenAIBench, significantly outperforming open-source, proprietary models and agentic methods.

However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints.

We define this paradigm as Test-Time Improvement (TTI). However, the mechanisms under how and why TTI succeed or fail remain poorly understood, and existing evaluation metrics fail to capture their task optimization efficiency, behavior adaptation after erroneous actions, and the specific utility of working memory for task completion. To address these gaps, we propose Test-time Improvement Diagnostic Evaluation (TIDE), an agent-agnostic and environment-agnostic framework that decomposes TTI into three comprehensive and interconnected dimensions. The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory. Through extensive experiments across diverse agents and environments, TIDE highlights that improving agent performance requires more than scaling internal reasoning, calling for explicitly optimizing the interaction dynamics between the agent and the environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc2dc\uac04 \uac1c\uc120(CTI)\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c TIDE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "TTI\uc758 \uc131\uacf5 \ub610\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c TIDE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec TTI\ub97c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TIDE\ub294 \uc218\ud589\uc758 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc21c\ud658 \ud589\ub3d9\uc778\uc9c0 \ub204\uc801\ub41c \uae30\uc5b5\uc778\uc9c0 \uc810\uac80\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud658\uacbd \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc790\uc728 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc2dc\uac04 \uac1c\uc120(Test-Time Improvement, TTI)\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 TTI\uac00 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uc624\ub958 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc774\ud6c4\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc801\uc751 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TTI\ub97c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801 \ubc0f \ud658\uacbd \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc2dc\uac04 \uac1c\uc120 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud3c9\uac00(TIDE)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 (1) \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0, (2) \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc21c\ud658\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\ub294\uc9c0 \ub610\ub294 (3) \ubd80\ub2f4\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ub204\uc801 \uae30\uc5b5\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, TIDE\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 Scaling \ud558\ub294 \uac83 \uc678\uc5d0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud658\uacbd \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations.

Direct multi-step forecasting (DMS) methods enable fast, parallel prediction of all future horizons but often lose temporal consistency across steps, while iterative multi-step forecasting (IMS) preserves temporal dependencies at the cost of error accumulation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we propose Back to the Future (BTTF), a simple yet effective framework that enhances forecasting stability through look-ahead augmentation and self-corrective refinement. Rather than relying on complex model architectures, BTTF revisits the fundamental forecasting process and refines a base model by ensembling the second-stage models augmented with their initial predictions. Despite its simplicity, our approach consistently improves long-horizon accuracy and mitigates the instability of linear forecasting models, achieving accuracy gains of up to 58% and demonstrating stable improvements even when the first-stage model is trained under suboptimal conditions. These results suggest that leveraging model-generated forecasts as augmentation can be a simple yet powerful way to enhance long-term prediction, even without complex architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 BTTF\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7a5\uae30 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21(LTSF)\uc740 \ubcd1\ub82c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "BTTF\ub294 \uc120\ud589 \ubcf4\uac15 \ubc0f \uc790\uae30 \uc218\uc815 \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294, BTTF\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc7ac\uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0 \ucd08\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc7a5\uae30 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc120\ud615 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 58%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7a5\uae30 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21(LTSF)\uc740 \ubcd1\ub82c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c1\uc811 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc608\uce21(DMS) \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubbf8\ub798 \uad6c\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub2e8\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc783\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc608\uce21(IMS)\uc740 \uc624\ub958 \ucd95\uc801\uacfc \ub290\ub9b0 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ub300\uac00\ub85c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798\ub85c\uc758 \ud68c\uadc0(Back to the Future, BTTF)\ub77c\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent \\emph{self-evolving} systems update memory based on interaction outcomes, but most existing evolution pipelines are developed for static train/test splits and only approximate online learning by folding static benchmarks, making them brittle under true distribution shift and continuous feedback. We introduce \\textsc{Live-Evo}, an online self-evolving memory system that learns from a stream of incoming data over time. \\textsc{Live-Evo} decouples \\emph{what happened} from \\emph{how to use it} via an Experience Bank and a Meta-Guideline Bank, compiling task-adaptive guidelines from retrieved experiences for each task. To manage memory online, \\textsc{Live-Evo} maintains experience weights and updates them from feedback: experiences that consistently help are reinforced and retrieved more often, while misleading or stale experiences are down-weighted and gradually forgotten, analogous to reinforcement and decay in human memory. On the live \\textit{Prophet Arena} benchmark over a 10-week horizon, \\textsc{Live-Evo} improves Brier score by 20.8\\% and increases market returns by 12.9\\%, while also transferring to deep-research benchmarks with consistent gains over strong baselines.

However, the internal dynamics of this compressed state remain largely opaque. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the runtime state dynamics of state-of-the-art Linear Attention models. We uncover a fundamental phenomenon termed State Rank Stratification, characterized by a distinct spectral bifurcation among linear attention heads: while one group maintains an effective rank oscillating near zero, the other exhibits rapid growth that converges to an upper bound. Extensive experiments across diverse inference contexts reveal that these dynamics remain strikingly consistent, indicating that the identity of a head,whether low-rank or high-rank,is an intrinsic structural property acquired during pre-training, rather than a transient state dependent on the input data. Furthermore, our diagnostic probes reveal a surprising functional divergence: low-rank heads are indispensable for model reasoning, whereas high-rank heads exhibit significant redundancy. Leveraging this insight, we propose Joint Rank-Norm Pruning, a zero-shot strategy that achieves a 38.9\\% reduction in KV-cache overhead while largely maintaining model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacc4\uae09 \uce35\ud654 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc640 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \ud070 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c1\ud0dc \uacc4\uae09 \uce35\ud654\ub77c\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1d\ud798.", "conclusion": "Joint Rank-Norm Pruning\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec KV-\uce90\uc2dc \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c 38.9% \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c.", "translated_summary": "\uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uace0\uc815 \ud06c\uae30 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud589\ub82c\ub85c \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \uc555\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\uc218 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \uc555\ucd95\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacc4\uae09 \uce35\ud654(State Rank Stratification)\ub77c\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ubd84\uae30 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9c0\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\uae09\uc774 \uc81c\ub85c\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc624\uc2e4\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub2e4\ub978 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc740 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294 \ube60\ub978 \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\uac8c \uc77c\uad00\ub428\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uba70, \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc758 \uc815\uccb4\uc131(\uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub610\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0)\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc548 \ud68d\ub4dd\ub41c \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc784\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud0d0\uc0ac\ub294 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ubd84\uae30\uc810\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4: \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ubc18\uba74 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 38.9%\uc758 KV-\uce90\uc2dc \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc804\ub7b5\uc778 Joint Rank-Norm Pruning\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing agents often suffer from inaccurate element grounding, the absence of site-specific procedural knowledge, and unstable long-term task tracking and memory, particularly when operating over complex Document Object Model structures. To address these limitations, we introduce Avenir-Web, a web agent that achieves a new open-source state of the art on the Online-Mind2Web benchmark in real-world deployment. Avenir-Web leverages a Mixture of Grounding Experts, Experience-Imitation Planning for incorporating procedural priors, and a task-tracking checklist combined with adaptive memory to enable robust and seamless interaction across diverse user interface paradigms. We evaluate Avenir-Web on Online-Mind2Web, a rigorous benchmark of live and user-centered web tasks.

Existing KV cache eviction strategies fail to address the heterogeneous attention distributions between visual and text tokens, leading to suboptimal efficiency or degraded performance. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Adaptive Eviction (HAE), a KV cache eviction framework that optimizes text-visual token interaction in MLLMs by implementing Dual-Attention Pruning during pre-filling (leveraging visual token sparsity and attention variance) and a Dynamic Decoding Eviction Strategy (inspired by OS Recycle Bins) during decoding. HAE minimizes KV cache usage across layers, reduces computational overhead via index broadcasting, and theoretically ensures superior information integrity and lower error bounds compared to greedy strategies, enhancing efficiency in both comprehension and generation tasks. Empirically, HAE reduces KV-Cache memory by 41\\% with minimal accuracy loss (0.3\\% drop) in image understanding tasks and accelerates story generation inference by 1.5x while maintaining output quality on Phi3.5-Vision-Instruct model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ud070 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec MLLMs\uc758 KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 Hierarchical Adaptive Eviction (HAE) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 LLM \ud1b5\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc84c\uc9c0\ub9cc, Transformer \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "HAE\ub294 Dual-Attention Pruning \ubc0f Dynamic Decoding Eviction Strategy\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc81c\uac70 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HAE\ub294 KV-\uce90\uc2dc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c 41% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc774\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 0.3%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc190\uc2e4\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HAE\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc624\ub958 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac01 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM(MLLMs)\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc84c\uc73c\ub098, Transformer \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc774\ucc28 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 KV \uce90\uc2dc \ud68c\uc218 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01 \ubc0f \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ud070 \uac04\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uc8fc\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Dual-Attention Pruning\uacfc Dynamic Decoding Eviction Strategy\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec MLLMs \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 KV \uce90\uc2dc \ud68c\uc218 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Hierarchical Adaptive Eviction(HAE)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form \"$A \\to A$\" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient descent. Empirically, we show that a 1B pretrained language model finetuned with the proposed data recipe achieves a 40% success rate on reversal tasks, in stark contrast to a near-zero success rate when trained solely on forward-knowledge data.

Existing agent frameworks rely on rigid, syntax-heavy state representations such as nested JSON, which require models to devote a substantial portion of their limited attention to syntactic processing rather than semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose Fat-Cat, a document-driven agent architecture that improves the signal-to-noise ratio of state management. By integrating three key components: (1) a Semantic File System that represents agent state as Markdown documents aligned with common pre-training corpora, (2) a Textual Strategy Evolution module that accumulates task-solving knowledge without parameter updates, and (3) a Closed-Loop Watcher that monitors reasoning trajectories to reduce hallucinations. Extensive reasoning, retrieval, and coding benchmarks, Fat-Cat consistently improves agent performance. It enables the Kimi-k2 model to outperform the proprietary GPT-4o baseline on HotPotQA.

We address this gap by manually annotating failed agent runs and release a novel benchmark of 115 failed trajectories spanning structured API workflows, incident management, and open-ended web/file tasks. Each trajectory is annotated with a critical failure step and a category from a grounded-theory derived, cross-domain failure taxonomy. To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory. It synthesizes constraints, evaluates them step-by-step, and produces an auditable validation log of constraint violations with associated evidence; an LLM-based judge uses this log to localize the critical step and category.

Jackson", "Alexey Zakharov"], "title": "Segment to Focus: Guiding Latent Action Models in the Presence of Distractors", "comment": null, "summary": "Latent Action Models (LAMs) learn to extract action-relevant representations solely from raw observations, enabling reinforcement learning from unlabelled videos and significantly scaling available training data. However, LAMs face a critical challenge in disentangling action-relevant features from action-correlated noise (e.g., background motion). Failing to filter these distractors causes LAMs to capture spurious correlations and build sub-optimal latent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce MaskLAM -- a lightweight modification to LAM training to mitigate this issue by incorporating visual agent segmentation. MaskLAM utilises segmentation masks from pretrained foundation models to weight the LAM reconstruction loss, thereby prioritising salient information over background elements while requiring no architectural modifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on continuous-control MuJoCo tasks, modified with action-correlated background noise. Our approach yields up to a 4x increase in accrued rewards compared to standard baselines and a 3x improvement in the latent action quality, as evidenced by linear probe evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MaskLAM\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec LAM \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uc218\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LAM\uc740 \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub3d9\uc791\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc640 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MaskLAM\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LAM \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc218\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc5b4 MuJoCo \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c MaskLAM\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud45c\uc900 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ucd5c\ub300 4\ubc30 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 3\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LAM \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, MaskLAM\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub378(LAM)\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \uad00\ucc30\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9 \uad00\ub828 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uac00\uc6a9 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LAM\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 \uad00\ub828 \ub178\uc774\uc988(\uc608: \ubc30\uacbd \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784)\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud589\ub3d9 \uad00\ub828 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ud574 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74 LAM\uc774 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 LAM \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc218\uc815\uc778 MaskLAM\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent. This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub79c\ub364 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548", "motivation": "\ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac00\uc815\uc774 \uc704\ubc30\ub418\uace0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub79c\ub364 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc0c1\uc218 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc218\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ud06c\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf4\uc218\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\uc800\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac00\uc815\uc774 \uc704\ubc30\ub418\uace0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0c1\uc218 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub79c\ub364 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub79c\ub364 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 \ubcf4\uc218\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub79c\ub364 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc0c1\uc218 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubcc0\ud658\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0\uc758 \uc0c1\uc218 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub79c\ub364 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc218\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Strong theoretical results are known in this setting, achieving nearly-tight $\u0398(\\sqrt{T})$-regret bounds. However, such detailed feedback can be unrealistic, and recent research has investigated more restricted settings such as trajectory feedback, where the agent observes all the visited state-action pairs, but only a single \\emph{aggregate} reward. In this paper, we consider a far more restrictive ``fully bandit'' feedback model for episodic MDPs, where the agent does not even observe the visited state-action pairs -- it only learns the aggregate reward. We provide the first efficient bandit learning algorithm for episodic MDPs with $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our regret has an exponential dependence on the horizon length $\\H$, which we show is necessary. We also obtain improved nearly-tight regret bounds for ``ordered'' MDPs; these can be used to model classical stochastic optimization problems such as $k$-item prophet inequality and sequential posted pricing. Finally, we evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm for the setting of $k$-item prophet inequalities; despite the highly restricted feedback, our algorithm's performance is comparable to that of a state-of-art learning algorithm (UCB-VI) with detailed state-action feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc MDP\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We present the first comprehensive Lean 4 formalization of statistical learning theory (SLT) grounded in empirical process theory. Our end-to-end formal infrastructure implement the missing contents in latest Lean 4 Mathlib library, including a complete development of Gaussian Lipschitz concentration, the first formalization of Dudley's entropy integral theorem for sub-Gaussian processes, and an application to least-squares (sparse) regression with a sharp rate. The project was carried out using a human-AI collaborative workflow, in which humans design proof strategies and AI agents execute tactical proof construction, leading to the human-verified Lean 4 toolbox for SLT. Beyond implementation, the formalization process exposes and resolves implicit assumptions and missing details in standard SLT textbooks, enforcing a granular, line-by-line understanding of the theory. This work establishes a reusable formal foundation and opens the door for future developments in machine learning theory.

Andrew Bagnell", "Aarti Singh", "Andrea Zanette"], "title": "Expanding the Capabilities of Reinforcement Learning via Text Feedback", "comment": "43 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "The success of RL for LLM post-training stems from an unreasonably uninformative source: a single bit of information per rollout as binary reward or preference label. At the other extreme, distillation offers dense supervision but requires demonstrations, which are costly and difficult to scale. We study text feedback as an intermediate signal: richer than scalar rewards, yet cheaper than complete demonstrations. Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks. Our results show that both methods consistently outperform strong baselines across benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL with an additional source of rich supervision at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "RL\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ud6c4\uc18d \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "LLM \ud6c4\uc18d \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c RL\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc6d0\ucc9c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ub300\uc2e0 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 RL \uc124\uc815\uc778 RL from Text Feedback(RLTF)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Self Distillation(RLTF-SD)\uc640 Feedback Modeling(RLTF-FM)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub450 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub9ac\uce58\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 RL\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud134 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \ud6c4\uc18d \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c RL\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc740 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\ub2f9 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc774\uc9c4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ub610\ub294 \uc120\ud638 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ube44\ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc815\ubcf4\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub86f\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \uc99d\ub958\ub294 \ubc00\uc811\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc911\uac04 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc2dc\uc5f0\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc800\ub834\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790, \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790 \ubc0f \uc790\ub3d9 \uc2ec\uc0ac\uc790\uac00 LLM \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ube44\ud310\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544 \uc774\ubbf8 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 RL \uc124\uc815\uc778 RL from Text Feedback(RLTF)\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud134 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc790\uae30 \uc99d\ub958(RLTF-SD), \uc774\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud134 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 2\ud134 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95; \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1(RLTF-FM), \uc774\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\ub860 \ud37c\uc990, \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc218\ud559, \ucc3d\uc758\uc801 \uc791\ubb38 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub450 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubaa8\ub450\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \ud070 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ucd94\uac00 \uac10\uc2dc \uc18c\uc2a4\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 RL\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Specifically, the policy is trained with integrated feedback from step-wise and outcome signals, while the reward model is jointly optimized via consistency feedback, which in turn further improves policy training. Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience. Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on AlfWorld and LiveBench, respectively.
