To mitigate the tension between goal stability and reactive correctness, we introduce (i) a hierarchical branch-thinking planner that decomposes life goals into parallel objective branches and uses simulation-guided validation plus tiered re-planning to ensure feasibility; (ii) an adaptive agent profile with dual-process memory that separates short-term execution traces from long-term semantic consolidation, enabling persistent yet evolving identity; and (iii) a human-in-the-loop steering interface that injects long-horizon objectives and short commands at appropriate abstraction levels, with effects propagated through memory rather than brittle prompt overrides. The environment integrates physiological survival costs, non-substitutable multi-tier production, an AMM-based price mechanism, and a gated education-occupation system. Using high-frequency transactions from the platforms mature phase, we find stable markets that reproduce key stylized facts (heavy-tailed returns and volatility clustering) and produce structured wealth stratification driven by education and access constraints. Ablations show simplified planners can match performance on narrow tasks, while the full architecture is more robust under multi-objective, long-horizon settings, supporting delayed investment and sustained exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIvilization v0\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \uacbd\uc81c\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc778\uacf5 \uc0ac\ud68c\ub85c, \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7a5\uae30 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ubc18\uc751\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uae34\uc7a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubd84\uae30 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud544, \uc778\uac04-\ub8e8\ud504 \uc870\ud0c0 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc774\ub4e0 \uc0ac\uc2e4\ub4e4\uc744 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, \uad50\uc721 \ubc0f \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc778 \ubd80\uc720\uce35 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac04\uc18c\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc881\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\uccb4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801, \uc7a5\uae30 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AIvilization v0\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \uacbd\uc81c\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c LLM-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uacf5\uac1c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc778\uacf5 \uc0ac\ud68c\ub85c, \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589\ub418\uba74\uc11c \uc7a5\uae30 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ubc18\uc751\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uae34\uc7a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 (i) \uc0dd\uc560 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1d\uad00\uc801 \ubd84\uae30\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc720\ub3c4 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc7ac\uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubd84\uae30 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4;

Unlike most previous studies, which focus primarily on algorithmic performance with respect to task completion, this article proposes a systematic set of general-purpose cooperation metrics aimed at characterizing not only efficiency, but also coordination and dependency between teams and agents, fairness, and sensitivity. These metrics are designed to be transferable to different multi-agent sequential domains similar to foraging. The proposed suite of metrics is structured into three main categories that jointly provide a multilevel characterization of cooperation: primary metrics, inter-team metrics, and intra-team metrics. They have been validated in a realistic destructive foraging scenario inspired by dynamic aquatic surface cleaning using heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. It involves two specialized teams with sequential dependencies: one focused on the search of resources, and another on their destruction.

We study two neural network-based agents that must communicate numerosities in a referential game using either discrete tokens or continuous sketches, thus exploring both symbolic and iconic representations. Without any pre-defined numeric concepts, the agents achieve high in-distribution communication accuracy in both communication channels and converge on high-precision symbol-meaning mappings. However, the emergent code is non-compositional: the agents fail to derive systematic messages for unseen numerosities, typically reusing the symbol of the highest trained numerosity (discrete), or collapsing extrapolated values onto a single sketch (continuous). We conclude that the communication pressure alone suffices for precise transmission of learned numerosities, but additional pressures are needed to yield compositional codes and generalisation abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uacf5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uc555\ub825\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c\uc9c0\uc640 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc\uac00 \uc778\uac04 \uc22b\uc790\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uac00 \uc218\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc778\uacf5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\ubb38.", "method": "\ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0b0 \ud1a0\ud070 \ub610\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2a4\ucf00\uce58\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ucc38\uc870 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ub7c9\uc744 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud568.", "result": "\uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc218\uc801 \uac1c\ub150 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub450 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ucc44\ub110 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc758 \uae30\ud638-\uc758\ubbf8 \ub9e4\ud551\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uc555\ub825\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc218\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc804\uc1a1\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc870\ud569 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc555\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub294 \uc218\ub7c9\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc758 \uc555\ub825\uc774 \uc778\uacf5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uac8c \ud558\uae30\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucd9c\ud604 \ucf54\ub4dc\uac00 \uc778\uac04 \uc22b\uc790\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud1a0\ud070 \ub610\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2a4\ucf00\uce58\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ub7c9\uc744 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ubc0f \uc544\uc774\ucf54\ub2c9 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc218\uc801 \uac1c\ub150 \uc5c6\uc774, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub450 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ucc44\ub110 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ubd84\ud3ec \ub0b4 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc758 \uae30\ud638-\uc758\ubbf8 \ub9e4\ud551\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd9c\ud604 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub294 \ube44\uc870\ud569\uc801\uc774\ub2e4: \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc218\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc218\ub7c9 \uc911 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uae30\ud638\ub97c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uac70\ub098(\uc774\uc0b0), \ub610\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2a4\ucf00\uce58\ub85c \uc678\uc0bd\ub41c \uac12\uc744 \ucd95\uc18c\ud55c\ub2e4(\uc5f0\uc18d). \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uc555\ub825\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc218\ub7c9\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc804\uc1a1\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc870\ud569 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc555\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uacb0\ub860\uc9d3\ub294\ub2e4."}}

Yet what constitutes a good workflow depends heavily on the task distribution and the available operators. Under domain shift, current systems typically rely on iterative workflow refinement to discover a feasible workflow from a large workflow space, incurring high iteration costs and yielding unstable, domain-specific behavior. In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass. To decide, we attribute the success or failure of workflow generation to counterfactual contributions from learned capabilities, thereby capturing which capabilities actually drive success by their marginal effects.

Because human oversight is expensive, one approach is trusted monitoring, where weaker, trusted models oversee stronger, untrusted models$\\unicode{x2013}$but this often fails when the untrusted model's actions exceed the monitor's comprehension. We introduce legibility protocols, which encourage the untrusted model to take actions that are easier for a monitor to evaluate.\n  We perform control evaluations in the APPS coding setting, where an adversarial agent attempts to write backdoored code without detection. We study legibility protocols that allow the untrusted model to thoroughly document its code with comments$\\unicode{x2013}$in contrast to prior work, which removed comments to prevent deceptive ones. We find that: (i) commenting protocols improve safety without sacrificing task performance relative to comment-removal baselines; (ii) commenting disproportionately benefits honest code, which typically has a natural explanation that resolves monitor suspicion, whereas backdoored code frequently lacks an easy justification; (iii) gains from commenting increase with monitor strength, as stronger monitors better distinguish genuine justifications from only superficially plausible ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uae30\uc220\uc778 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 AI \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc758\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uba85\ud655\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac10\uc2dc\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uae30\uc220 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ucca0\uc800\ud788 \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uba85\ud655\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, APPS \ucf54\ub529 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc8fc\uc11d \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc5c5\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \uc815\uc9c1\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \ucf54\ub4dc\uac00 \uc790\uc8fc \uc27d\uac8c \uc124\uba85\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\uc758 \uac15\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc544\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d \uc8fc\uc11d\uc758 \uc774\uc775\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\uc640 \ubd88\uacfc\ud558\uac8c \uadf8\ub7f4\ub4ef\ud55c \uac83\ub4e4\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub2a5\uc219\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc758\uc81c\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc911 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucde8\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uae30\uc220\uc778 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04 \uac10\ub3c5\uc774 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac10\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\uc758 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \ub54c \uc885\uc885 \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\uac00 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uba85\ud655\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 APPS \ucf54\ub529 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec, \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc791\uc131\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ucca0\uc800\ud788 \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uba85\ud655\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ub300\uc870\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (i) \uc8fc\uc11d \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc81c\uac70 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4;

However, current evaluation frameworks lack a consensus metric and suffer from two critical flaws: they often assume independence across time steps or variables, and they demonstrably lack sensitivity to tail events, the very occurrences that are most pivotal in real-world decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule. These metrics enable a more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting, facilitating the development of more robust probabilistic algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucee4\ub110 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uae08\uc735, \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \uc5f0\uad6c, \uae30\ud6c4 \uacfc\ud559 \ub4f1 \ub192\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc218\ubc18\ub418\ub294 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud569\uc758\ub41c \uc9c0\ud45c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacb0\ud568\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uadf8\ub2c8\ucc98 \ucd5c\ub300 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58(Sig-MMD)\uc640 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac80\uc5f4\ub41c Sig-MMD(CSig-MMD)\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucee4\ub110 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2dc\uadf8\ub2c8\ucc98 \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac15\uac74\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CSig-MMD\ub294 \uaf2c\ub9ac \uc0ac\uac74 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac80\uc5f4 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc88b\uc740 \uc810\uc218 \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc808\uc131\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc9c1\uc811 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uae08\uc735\uacfc \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1\ud559, \uae30\ud6c4 \uacfc\ud559 \ub4f1 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud569\uc758\ub41c \uc9c0\ud45c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ub610\ub294 \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uace0, \ub458\uc9f8, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc778 \uaf2c\ub9ac \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uadf8\ub2c8\ucc98 \ucd5c\ub300 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58(Sig-MMD)\uc640 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac80\uc5f4\ub41c Sig-MMD(CSig-MMD)\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucee4\ub110 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2dc\uadf8\ub2c8\ucc98 \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uac15\uac74\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c CSig-MMD\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc790\uac00 \uaf2c\ub9ac \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac80\uc5f4 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc808\uc131\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec, \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Graph-based methods are emerging as promising solutions by leveraging multi-host interactions to promote detection accuracy. But most of them face a critical problem: Graph Drift, where the flow statistics or topological information of a graph change over time. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a graph-assisted encrypted traffic detection system, MalMoE, which applies Mixture of Experts (MoE) to select the best expert model for drift-aware classification. Particularly, we design 1-hop-GNN-like expert models that handle different graph drifts by analyzing graphs with different features.

For a single attention head, shared random softmax weights couple different width coordinates and induce non-Gaussian field statistics that persist in the infinite-width limit $d_k\\to\\infty$. We compute the two-point function in an attention-weight representation and show how Euclidean-invariant kernels can be engineered via random-feature token embeddings. We then analyze the connected four-point function and identify an \"independence-breaking\" contribution, expressible as a covariance over query-key weights, which remains finite at infinite width. Finally, we show that summing many independent heads with standard $1/N_h$ normalization suppresses connected non-Gaussian correlators as $1/N_h$, yielding a Gaussian NN-QFT in the large-head limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \uc591\uc790\uc7a5 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 $n$-\uc810 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \uc591\uc790\uc7a5 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec, \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\uc624\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc591\uc790\uc7a5 \uc774\ub860(NN-QFT) \ud2c0 \uc548\uc5d0\uc11c, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc8fc\uc758 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc640 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \ubb34\uc791\uc704 softmax \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub108\ube44 \uc88c\ud45c\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub450 \uc810 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ub124 \uc810 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uba70, \ubb34\ud55c \ub108\ube44\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ube44\uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud45c\uc900 $1/N_h$ \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\uc0b0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ube44\uc815\uaddc \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 NN-QFT\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \uc591\uc790\uc7a5 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc591\uc790\uc7a5 \uc774\ub860(NN-QFT) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \ub0b4\uc5b4 $n$-\uc810 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c \uc8fc\uc758 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \ubb34\uc791\uc704 softmax \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub108\ube44 \uc88c\ud45c\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ubb34\ud55c \ub108\ube44 \ud55c\uacc4 $d_k\to\text{\ubb34\ud55c\ub300}$\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\ub294 \ube44\uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud544\ub4dc \ud1b5\uacc4\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc8fc\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uc810 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ud2b9\uc131 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubd88\ubcc0 \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ub124 \uc810 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ubb34\ud55c \ub108\ube44\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ud55c\ud558\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac-\ud0a4 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 '\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131 \ud30c\uad34' \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \ud45c\uc900 $1/N_h$ \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud569\uc0b0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ube44\uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c $1/N_h$\ub85c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uace0, \ud070 \ud5e4\ub4dc \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 NN-QFT\ub97c \uc5bb\uac8c \ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Current benchmarks rarely capture this limitation. To bridge this gap, we present an utility feedback centric framework. Our contributions are: (i) AgoraBench, a new benchmark spanning nine challenging settings (e.g., deception, monopoly) that supports diverse strategy modeling; (ii) human-aligned, economically grounded metrics derived from utility theory. This is operationalized via agent utility, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio that implicitly measure how well the negotiation aligns with human preference and (iii) a human preference grounded dataset with learning pipeline that strengthens LLMs' bargaining ability through both prompting and finetuning. Empirical results indicate that baseline LLM strategies often diverge from human preferences, while our mechanism substantially improves negotiation performance, yielding deeper strategic behavior and stronger opponent awareness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uae4a\uc774\uc640 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud611\uc0c1\uc774 \uc608\uc220\uc774\ub098 \uc9c1\uad00\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 LLM\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AgoraBench\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\uc758 \uce21\uc815 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, LLM\uc758 \ud611\uc0c1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\ucd08 LLM \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ud611\uc0c1 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0c1\ub300 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud611\uc0c1\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc608\uc220\uc774\ub098 \uc9c1\uad00\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uae4a\uc774\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc798 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc544\uace0\ub77c\ubca4\uce58(AgoBench)\ub77c\ub294 \uc544\ud649 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815(\uc608: \uc18d\uc784\uc218, \ub3c5\uc810)\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c; (ii) \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc778\uac04 \ub9de\ucda4 \uacbd\uc81c \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ud45c. \uc774\ub294 \ud611\uc0c1\ub825\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\uc5d0 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc798 \ub9de\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0, \ud611\uc0c1\ub825 \ubc0f \uc778\uc218 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b4\uc601\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4; (iii) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \ud611\uc0c1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b. \uc2e4\uc99d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uae30\ucd08 LLM \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud611\uc0c1 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uac15\ud55c \uc0c1\ub300 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We introduce two novel primitives--authenticated prompts and authenticated context--that provide cryptographically verifiable provenance across LLM workflows. Authenticated prompts enable self-contained lineage verification, while authenticated context uses tamper-evident hash chains to ensure integrity of dynamic inputs. Building on these primitives, we formalize a policy algebra with four proven theorems providing protocol-level Byzantine resistance--even adversarial agents cannot violate organizational policies. Five complementary defenses--from lightweight resource controls to LLM-based semantic validation--deliver layered, preventative security with formal guarantees. Evaluation against representative attacks spanning 6 exhaustive categories achieves 100% detection with zero false positives and nominal overhead.

However, these attacks rely on complex optimizations that have large computational overheads, making them impractical in many real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight adversarial agent that implements strategies (policies) trained via reinforcement learning (RL) that learn to evade ML-based NIDS without requiring online optimization. This attack proceeds by (1) offline training, where the agent learns to evade a surrogate ML model by perturbing malicious flows using network traffic data assumed to be collected via reconnaissance, then (2) deployment, where the trained agent is used in a compromised device controlled by an attacker to evade ML-based NIDS using learned attack strategies. We evaluate our approach across diverse NIDS and several white-, gray-, and black-box threat models. We demonstrate that attacks using these lightweight agents can be highly effective (reaching up to 48.9% attack success rate), extremely fast (requiring as little as 5.72ms to craft an attack), and require negligible resources (e.g., 0.52MB of memory). Through this work, we demonstrate that future botnets driven by lightweight learning-based agents can be highly effective and widely deployable in diverse environments of compromised devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacbd\ub7c9 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 ML \uae30\ubc18 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(NIDS)\uc744 \ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ML \uae30\ubc18 NIDS\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c NIDS\ub97c \ud68c\ud53c\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacf5\uaca9 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ubc30\uce58 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub098\ub25c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacbd\ub7c9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 48.9%\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uaca9 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 5.72ms\ub85c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uadf9\ud788 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacbd\ub7c9 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd07\ub137\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 ML \uae30\ubc18 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(NIDS)\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubcc0\uacbd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud68c\ud53c\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc5c6\uc774 ML \uae30\ubc18 NIDS\ub97c \ud68c\ud53c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5(\uc815\ucc45)\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 (1) \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc815\ucc30\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc131 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcc0\uacbd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\uccb4 ML \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud68c\ud53c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, (2) \ubc30\ud3ec \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \uc190\uc0c1\ub41c \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec ML \uae30\ubc18 NIDS\ub97c \ud68c\ud53c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c NIDS\uc640 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud654\uc774\ud2b8-, \uadf8\ub808\uc774-, \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801(\ucd5c\ub300 48.9% \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec)\uc774\uba70, \uadf9\ud788 \ube60\ub974\uace0(\uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 5.72ms \uc18c\uc694) \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc801\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ubd07\ub137\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc190\uc0c1\ub41c \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Achieving substantial improvements in these areas is a non-trivial task, traditionally relying on extensive manual iterations to test new hypotheses. We propose a self-evolving system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically those from Google's Gemini family, to autonomously generate, train, and deploy high-performing, complex model changes within an end-to-end automated workflow. The self-evolving system is comprised of an Offline Agent (Inner Loop) that performs high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and an Online Agent (Outer Loop) that validates candidates against delayed north star business metrics in live production. Our agents act as specialized Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs): they exhibit deep reasoning capabilities, discovering novel improvements in optimization algorithms and model architecture, and formulating innovative reward functions that target long-term user engagement. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through several successful production launches at YouTube, confirming that autonomous, LLM-driven evolution can surpass traditional engineering workflows in both development velocity and model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744

Existing approaches assume a symbol grounding function that maps high-dimensional states to consistent symbolic representations and a manually specified action masking techniques to constrain actions. In this paper, we propose Neuro-symbolic Action Masking (NSAM), a novel framework that automatically learn symbolic models, which are consistent with given domain constraints of high-dimensional states, in a minimally supervised manner during the DRL process. Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions. NSAM enables end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning and deep policy optimization, where improvements in symbolic grounding and policy learning mutually reinforce each other. We evaluate NSAM on multiple domains with constraints, and experimental results demonstrate that NSAM significantly improves sample efficiency of DRL agent while substantially reducing constraint violations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Neuro-symbolic Action Masking (NSAM)\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc30\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL)\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uc911\uc5d0 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "NSAM\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc81c\uc57d\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ud638 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc30\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c NSAM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, DRL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uace0 \uc81c\uc57d \uc704\ubc18\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "NSAM\uc740 \uae30\ud638 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc2ec\uce35 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud638 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL)\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uae30\ud638 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 DRL \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc911 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uae30\ud638 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Neuro-symbolic Action Masking (NSAM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This SoK presents a comprehensive overview of the PI landscape, covering attacks, defenses, and their evaluation practices. Through a systematic literature review and quantitative analysis, we establish taxonomies that categorize PI attacks by payload generation strategies (heuristic vs. optimization) and defenses by intervention stages (text, model, and execution levels). Our analysis reveals a key limitation shared by many existing defenses and benchmarks: they largely overlook context-dependent tasks, in which agents are authorized to rely on runtime environmental observations to determine actions. To address this gap, we introduce AgentPI, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate agent behavior under context-dependent interaction settings. Using AgentPI, we empirically evaluate representative defenses and show that no single approach can simultaneously achieve high trustworthiness, high utility, and low latency. Moreover, we show that many defenses appear effective under existing benchmarks by suppressing contextual inputs, yet fail to generalize to realistic agent settings where context-dependent reasoning is essential.

Many existing survival analysis approaches for interval-censored data rely on strong model assumptions or cannot handle high-dimensional predictors. We develop ICODEN, an ordinary differential equation-based neural network for interval-censored data that models the hazard function through deep neural networks and obtains the cumulative hazard by solving an ordinary differential equation. ICODEN does not require the proportional hazards assumption or a prespecified parametric form for the hazard function, thereby permitting flexible survival modeling. Across simulation settings with proportional or non-proportional hazards and both linear and nonlinear covariate effects, ICODEN consistently achieves satisfactory predictive accuracy and remains stable as the number of predictors increases. Applications to data from multiple phases of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and to two Age-Related Eye Disease Studies (AREDS and AREDS2) for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) demonstrate ICODEN's robust prediction performance. In both applications, predicting time-to-AD or time-to-late AMD, ICODEN effectively uses hundreds to more than 1,000 SNPs and supports data-driven subgroup identification with differential progression risk profiles. These results establish ICODEN as a practical assumption-lean tool for prediction with interval-censored survival data in high-dimensional biomedical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "ICODEN\uc740 \uac04\uc12d\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc0dd\uc874 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \uac00\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc0dd\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac04\uc12d\ub41c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc0dd\uc874 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac15\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc608\uce21 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4.", "method": "ICODEN\uc740 \uac04\uc12d\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uae4a\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc815\uaddc \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \ub204\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "ICODEN\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac00\uc0c1 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9cc\uc871\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc608\uce21 \ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud574\ub3c4 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38\ubcd1 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc601\uc0c1 \uc774\ub2c8\uc154\ud2f0\ube0c(ADNI)\uc640 \uc5f0\ub839 \uad00\ub828 \ud669\ubc18 \ubcc0\uc131(AMD) \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c ICODEN\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ICODEN\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc0dd\ubb3c \uc758\ud559 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac04\uc12d\ub41c \uc0dd\uc874 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\ub9e4\uae40\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uac04\uc12d\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc0dd\uc874 \ubd84\uc11d \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uac15\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc608\uce21 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac04\uc12d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc778 ICODEN\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

We introduce ScratchWorld, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents on program-by-construction tasks in Scratch. Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art multimodal language models and GUI agents reveal a substantial reasoning--acting gap, highlighting persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong planning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "ScratchWorld\ub294 Scratch\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uad6c\ucd95 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub85c, GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 GUI\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Use-Modify-Create \uad50\uc721 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c ScratchWorld\ub294 Create, Debug, Extend, Compute\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c 83\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\ud68d\ub41c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ub4dc\ub798\uadf8 \uc564 \ub4dc\ub86d \uc870\uc791\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc6d0\uc2dc \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 API\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ub454 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2e4\ud328\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc9c4\ub2e8.", "conclusion": "\ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uacc4\ud68d \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c GUI \uc870\uc791\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Scratch\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ube14\ub85d \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \ub85c\uc6b0\ucf54\ub4dc \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Scratch\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uad6c\ucd95 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 ScratchWorld\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

We introduce authenticated workflows, the first complete trust layer for enterprise agentic AI. Security reduces to protecting four fundamental boundaries: prompts, tools, data, and context. We enforce intent (operations satisfy organizational policies) and integrity (operations are cryptographically authentic) at every boundary crossing, combining cryptographic elimination of attack classes with runtime policy enforcement. This delivers deterministic security--operations either carry valid cryptographic proof or are rejected. We introduce MAPL, an AI-native policy language that expresses agentic constraints dynamically as agents evolve and invocation context changes, scaling as O(log M + N) policies versus O(M x N) rules through hierarchical composition with cryptographic attestations for workflow dependencies. We prove practicality through a universal security runtime integrating nine leading frameworks (MCP, A2A, OpenAI, Claude, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Haystack) through thin adapters requiring zero protocol modifications. Formal proofs establish completeness and soundness. Empirical validation shows 100% recall with zero false positives across 174 test cases, protection against 9 of 10 OWASP Top 10 risks, and complete mitigation of two high impact production CVEs.",

However, a principled way of designing effective reward shaping functions, especially for complex continuous control problems, remains largely under-explained. In this work, we propose to automatically learn a reward shaping function for continuous control problems from offline datasets, potentially contaminated by unobserved confounding variables. Specifically, our method builds upon the recently proposed causal Bellman equation to learn a tight upper bound on the optimal state values, which is then used as the potentials in the Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) framework. Our proposed reward shaping algorithm is tested with Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) on multiple commonly used continuous control benchmarks and exhibits strong performance guarantees under unobserved confounders. More broadly, our work marks a solid first step towards confounding robust continuous control from a causal perspective.

To address this, based on an analogy between the Dockerfile and the agentic task, we propose to employ agents to simulate and explore environment histories, guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of a healthy environment, its state can be inverted to an earlier one with runtime failures, from which a task can be derived by packing the buggy state and the corresponding error messages. With our method, named CLI-Gym, a total of 1,655 environment-intensive tasks are derived, being the largest collection of its kind. Moreover, with curated successful trajectories, our fine-tuned model, named LiberCoder, achieves substantial absolute improvements of +21.1% (to 46.1%) on Terminal-Bench, outperforming various strong baselines.

Nudges are subtle, non-coercive interventions that influence behavior without limiting choice, showing strong impact on health outcomes like medication adherence. However, identifying these interventions from PubMed's 8 million+ articles is a bottleneck. Our system uses a novel multi-stage pipeline: first, hybrid filtering (keywords, TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and a \"nudge-term bonus\") reduces the corpus to about 81,000 candidates. Second, we use OpenScholar (quantized LLaMA 3.1 8B) to classify papers and extract structured fields like nudge type and target behavior in a single pass, validated against a JSON schema.\n  We evaluated four configurations on a labeled test set (N=197). The best setup (Title/Abstract/Intro) achieved a 67.0% F1 score and 72.0% recall, ideal for discovery. A high-precision variant using self-consistency (7 randomized passes) achieved 100% precision with 12% recall, demonstrating a tunable trade-off for high-trust use cases.

A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents.

Such states are typically deep in the execution space, gated by preconditions, or overshadowed by lower-value paths that consume limited fuzzing budgets. Meanwhile, developers routinely surface risk-relevant insights during code review, yet this information is largely ignored by automated testing tools. We present EyeQ, a system that leverages developer intelligence from code reviews to guide fuzzing. EyeQ extracts security-relevant signals from review discussions, localizes the implicated program regions, and translates these insights into annotation-based guidance for fuzzing. The approach operates atop existing annotation-aware fuzzing, requiring no changes to program semantics or developer workflows. We first validate EyeQ through a human-guided feasibility study on a security-focused dataset of PHP code reviews, establishing a strong baseline for review-guided fuzzing. We then automate the workflow using a large language model with carefully designed prompts. EyeQ significantly improves vulnerability discovery over standard fuzzing configurations, uncovering more than 40 previously unknown bugs in the security-critical PHP codebase.", "AI": {"tldr": "EyeQ\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud37c\uc9d5\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \ud37c\uc800\ub4e4\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4.", "method": "EyeQ\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \ub9ac\ubdf0 \ub17c\uc758\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548 \uad00\ub828 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uad00\ub828 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ucc3e\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc8fc\uc11d \uae30\ubc18 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "EyeQ\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \ud37c\uc9d5 \uad6c\uc131\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548 \ube44\uc0c1\ubc84\uc804\uc758 PHP \ucf54\ub4dc\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c 40\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc84\uadf8\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EyeQ\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc778\uc2dd \ud37c\uc9d5 \uc704\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc758\ubbf8\ub098 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ubcc0\uacbd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \ud37c\uc800\ub4e4\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc885\uc885 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589 \uacf5\uac04 \uae4a\uc219\uc774 \uc704\uce58\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc120\ud589 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud37c\uc9d5 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uc18c\ubaa8\ud558\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \uac00\uce58\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \uac00\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8, \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \ub9ac\ubdf0 \uc911\uc5d0 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \uad00\ub828 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc815\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ubb34\uc2dc\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud37c\uc9d5\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 EyeQ\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While pre-trained large models have been hypothesized to contain similar knowledge due to extensive pre-training on vast amounts of internet scale data, using them directly in a search procedure is inefficient and inaccurate. Conversely, partial models focus on making high quality predictions for a subset of state and actions: those linked through affordances that achieve user intents~\\citep{khetarpal2020can}. Can we posit large models as partial world models? We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances. In the multi-task setting, we introduce distribution-robust affordances and show that partial models can be extracted to significantly improve search efficiency. Empirical evaluations in tabletop robotics tasks demonstrate that our affordance-aware partial models reduce the search branching factor and achieve higher rewards compared to full world models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud558\uace0, \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc778\ud130\ub137 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac80\uc0c9 \uc808\ucc28\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacfc\uc5c5 \ube44\uad00\ub828\uc801, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc870\uac74\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubc30\uae09 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 affordance\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\ubd84 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc0c9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud14c\uc774\ube14\ud0d1 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c affordance-aware \ubd80\ubd84 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubd84\uae30 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc804\uccb4 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc138\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc778\ud130\ub137 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac00\uc815\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9 \uc808\ucc28\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \ubd80\ubd84 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 affordances\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uac00\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uae4c\uc694? \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ub2f5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uacfc\uc5c5 \ube44\uad00\ub828\uc801, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc870\uac74\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc affordances\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ubc1b\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubcf4\uc720\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uacfc\uc5c5 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc30\uae09 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 affordances\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \ubd80\ubd84 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc0c9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud14c\uc774\ube14\ud0d1 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 affordance-aware \ubd80\ubd84 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubd84\uae30 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc804\uccb4 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\uacbd-\uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 bidirectional Formal-of-Thought \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd-\uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc591 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc6d0\uc790\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d\uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c Dafny \uc0ac\uc591 \ubc0f Z3 Satisfiability modulo \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 LLM-as-a-Judge \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 16.6% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, 7B \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 72B \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ub9cc\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 90% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc791\ub3d9\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 LLM-as-a-Judge\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4: \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \uac10\ub3c5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc778\uac00?

A short defensive system prompt that treats Skills as untrusted and forbids sensitive actions prevents these malicious tool calls and instead surfaces the suspicious hidden instructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc11c\ud654 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc8fc\uc11d \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uad8c\uc7a5 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Skills\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Markdown Skill\uc774 HTML\ub85c \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\ub420 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "DeepSeek-V3.2\uc640 GLM-4.5-Air\uac00 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc0bd\uc785\ub41c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub85c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Skills\ub97c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uace0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uae08\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc9e7\uc740 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc758\uc2ec\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uad8c\uc7a5 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Skills\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubb38\uc11c\ud654 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc8fc\uc11d \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: Markdown Skill\uc774 HTML\ub85c \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\ub420 \ub54c, HTML \uc8fc\uc11d \ube14\ub85d\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uac80\ud1a0\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac8c \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6d0\uc2dc \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \uacf5\uae09\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DeepSeek-V3.2\uc640 GLM-4.5-Air\uac00 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud569\ubc95\uc801\uc778 Skill\uc5d0 \ucd94\uac00\ub41c \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc0bd\uc785\ub41c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc758\ub3c4\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Effective specialisation requires learning new reaction knowledge while preserving general chemical understanding across related tasks. Here, we evaluate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for organic reaction prediction on limited, complex datasets. Using USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions, we benchmark forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and reagent prediction. LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both fine-tuning approaches generalise beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions. Notably, C-H functionalisation fine-tuning reveals that LoRA and full fine-tuning encode subtly different reactivity patterns, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation with LoRA. As LLMs continue to scale, our results highlight the practicality of modular, parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for their flexible deployment for chemistry applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud654\ud559 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d \uc5f0\uad6c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ubc18\uc751 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud654\ud559 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d R&D\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ubc18\uc751 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uae30 \ubc18\uc751 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\uccb4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 LoRA\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, USPTO \ubc18\uc751 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc640 C-H \uae30\ub2a5\ud654 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "LoRA\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc778 \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, LLM\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc774 \uacc4\uc18d\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud654\ud559 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654\ub41c, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc720\uae30 \ud654\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ub354 \uc791\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ubc18\uc751 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud654\ud559 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d R&D\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654\ub294 \uad00\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18 \ud654\ud559 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc18\uc751 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uae30 \ubc18\uc751 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\uccb4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, this paradigm introduces significant privacy risks, as agents typically capture and process entire screen contents, thereby exposing sensitive personal data such as phone numbers, addresses, messages, and financial information. Existing defenses either reduce UI exposure, obfuscate only task-irrelevant content, or rely on user authorization, but none can protect task-critical sensitive information while preserving seamless agent usability.\n  We propose an anonymization-based privacy protection framework that enforces the principle of available-but-invisible access to sensitive data: sensitive information remains usable for task execution but is never directly visible to the cloud-based agent. Our system detects sensitive UI content using a PII-aware recognition model and replaces it with deterministic, type-preserving placeholders (e.g., PHONE_NUMBER#a1b2c) that retain semantic categories while removing identifying details. A layered architecture comprising a PII Detector, UI Transformer, Secure Interaction Proxy, and Privacy Gatekeeper ensures consistent anonymization across user instructions, XML hierarchies, and screenshots, mediates all agent actions over anonymized interfaces, and supports narrowly scoped local computations when reasoning over raw values is necessary.\n  Extensive experiments on the AndroidLab and PrivScreen benchmarks show that our framework substantially reduces privacy leakage across multiple models while incurring only modest utility degradation, achieving the best observed privacy-utility trade-off among existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ube44\uac00\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacfc\uc81c \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ud06c\ub2e4.", "method": "PII \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c UI \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub9ac \ud45c\uc2dc\uc790\ub85c \uad50\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad6c\ud604\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc800\ud558\ub9cc\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc88b\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc0f \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uccb4 \ud654\uba74 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc804\ud654\ubc88\ud638, \uc8fc\uc18c, \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uc815 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub178\ucd9c\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc740 UI \ub178\ucd9c\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uac70\ub098, \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub9cc \ubaa8\ud638\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uac70\ub098, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc2b9\uc778\uc744 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc775\uba85\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4: \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 PII \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c UI \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc720\ud615 \ubcf4\uc874\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\ub9ac \ud45c\uc2dc\uc790(\uc608: PHONE_NUMBER#a1b2c)\ub85c \uad50\uccb4\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uc138\ubd80\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.

To deal with this issue, we present Agentic Knowledge Distillation, which consists of a powerful LLM acts as an autonomous teacher that fine-tunes a smaller student SLM, deployable for security tasks without human intervention. The teacher LLM autonomously generates synthetic data and iteratively refines a smaller on-device student model until performance plateaus. We compare four LLMs in this teacher role (Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2 Codex, Gemini 3 Pro, and DeepSeek V3.2) on SMS spam/smishing detection with two student SLMs (Qwen2.5-0.5B and SmolLM2-135M). Our results show that performance varies substantially depending on the teacher LLM, with the best configuration achieving 94.31% accuracy and 96.25% recall. We also compare against a Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) baseline that uses the same synthetic knowledge and LoRA setup but without iterative feedback or targeted refinement; agentic knowledge distillation substantially outperforms it (e.g. 86-94% vs 50-80% accuracy), showing that closed-loop feedback and targeted refinement are critical. These findings demonstrate that agentic knowledge distillation can rapidly yield effective security classifiers for edge deployment, but outcomes depend strongly on which teacher LLM is used.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SMS \ud53c\uc2f1 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c Agentic Knowledge Distillation\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SMS \ud53c\uc2f1 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uae09\uc99d\ud558\uba74\uc11c, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uad6c\uc2dd\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \ub77c\ubca8\ub41c \uc704\ud611 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac15\ub825\ud55c LLM\uc774 \uc790\uc728 \uad50\uc0ac\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378(SLM)\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 Agentic Knowledge Distillation\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad50\uc0ac LLM\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc815\uccb4\ub420 \ub54c\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc791\uc740 \uc628\ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad50\uc0ac \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 LLM(Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2 Codex, Gemini 3 Pro, DeepSeek V3.2)\uacfc \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ud559\uc0dd SLM(Qwen2.5-0.5B, SmolLM2-135M)\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uad50\uc0ac LLM\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud06c\uac8c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\uba70, \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uad6c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c 94.31% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 96.25% \uc7ac\ud604\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Agentic knowledge distillation\uc740 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uad50\uc0ac LLM\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud06c\uac8c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "SMS \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\uc2f1 \uacf5\uaca9(smishing)\uc774 \uae09\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc628\ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uad6c\uc2dd\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \ub77c\ubca8\ub41c \uc704\ud611 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c LLM\uc774 \uc790\uc728 \uad50\uc0ac \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc791\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd SLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 Agentic Knowledge Distillation\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad50\uc0ac LLM\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc815\uccb4\ub420 \ub54c\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc791\uc740 \uc628\ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace. These findings have implications for interpretability, training curriculum design, and understanding the role of overparameterization in neural network learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacfc\uc801\ud569\ub41c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacfc\uc801\ud569\ub41c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub4c8\ub7ec \uc0b0\uc220 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud6c8\ub828 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 3-4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub79c\ub364 \uc2dc\ub4dc\uc640 \uc911\uac04 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uac74\ud558\uac8c \uad00\ucc30\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \ud761\uc218\ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \ud575\uc2ec \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 \uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd95\uc18c\ub41c \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d0\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\ub41c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucca0\uc800\ud788 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub7ec \uc0b0\uc220 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 $d=128$\uc758 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud568\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \ube60\ub974\uac8c 3-4 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\ub85c \ubd95\uad34\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ubd95\uad34\ub294 \ub79c\ub364 \uc2dc\ub4dc\uc640 \uc911\uac04 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uac15\uac74\ud558\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac04\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1)sharp attention concentration\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4 \ub0b4 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uc88c\ud45c\ub97c \ub530\ub77c \ud3ec\ud654\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c\ub2e4, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD)\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ud22c\uc601\ud560 \ub54c \uc57d\uac04\uc758 \uc801\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70 \ube44\uc801\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \uc9c1\uad50 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4, (3) \ud76c\uc18c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e4\ud589 \uc790\uccb4\ub97c \uaca9\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc5d0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub418\uc5b4 \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \ud761\uc218\ud558\uace0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 \uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd95\uc18c\ub41c \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ub418\ub294 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \ud6c8\ub828 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc14\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Current implementations predominantly rely on a \"Screen-as-Interface\" paradigm, which inherits structural vulnerabilities and conflicts with the mobile ecosystem's economic foundations. In this paper, we conduct a systematic security analysis of state-of-the-art mobile agents using Doubao Mobile Assistant as a representative case. We decompose the threat landscape into four dimensions - Agent Identity, External Interface, Internal Reasoning, and Action Execution - revealing critical flaws such as fake App identity, visual spoofing, indirect prompt injection, and unauthorized privilege escalation stemming from a reliance on unstructured visual data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Aura, an Agent Universal Runtime Architecture for a clean-slate secure agent OS. Aura replaces brittle GUI scraping with a structured, agent-native interaction model. It adopts a Hub-and-Spoke topology where a privileged System Agent orchestrates intent, sandboxed App Agents execute domain-specific tasks, and the Agent Kernel mediates all communication. The Agent Kernel enforces four defense pillars: (i) cryptographic identity binding via a Global Agent Registry; (ii) semantic input sanitization through a multilayer Semantic Firewall; (iii) cognitive integrity via taint-aware memory and plan-trajectory alignment; and (iv) granular access control with non-deniable auditing. Evaluation on MobileSafetyBench shows that, compared to Doubao, Aura improves low-risk Task Success Rate from roughly 75% to 94.3%, reduces high-risk Attack Success Rate from roughly 40% to 4.4%, and achieves near-order-of-magnitude latency gains.

One promising recent approach addresses graph transfer by discretizing the adaptation process, typically through the construction of intermediate graphs or stepwise alignment procedures. However, such discrete strategies often fail in real-world scenarios, where graph structures evolve continuously and nonlinearly, making it difficult for fixed-step alignment to approximate the actual transformation process. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{DiffGDA}, a \\textbf{Diff}usion-based \\textbf{GDA} method that models the domain adaptation process as a continuous-time generative process. We formulate the evolution from source to target graphs using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), enabling the joint modeling of structural and semantic transitions. To guide this evolution, a domain-aware network is introduced to steer the generative process toward the target domain, encouraging the diffusion trajectory to follow an optimal adaptation path. We theoretically show that the diffusion process converges to the optimal solution bridging the source and target domains in the latent space. Extensive experiments on 14 graph transfer tasks across 8 real-world datasets demonstrate DiffGDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffGDA\ub294

The transition from competition-level problem-solving to professional research, however, requires navigating vast literature and constructing long-horizon proofs. In this work, we introduce Aletheia, a math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions end-to-end in natural language. Specifically, Aletheia is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level problems, and intensive tool use to navigate the complexities of mathematical research. We demonstrate the capability of Aletheia from Olympiad problems to PhD-level exercises and most notably, through several distinct milestones in AI-assisted mathematics research: (a) a research paper (Feng26) generated by AI without any human intervention in calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights; (b) a research paper (LeeSeo26) demonstrating human-AI collaboration in proving bounds on systems of interacting particles called independent sets; and (c) an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation (Feng et al., 2026a) of 700 open problems on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, including autonomous solutions to four open questions. In order to help the public better understand the developments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest codifying standard levels quantifying autonomy and novelty of AI-assisted results.

Thomas Hou", "Wenjing Lou"], "title": "IU-GUARD: Privacy-Preserving Spectrum Coordination for Incumbent Users under Dynamic Spectrum Sharing", "comment": null, "summary": "With the growing demand for wireless spectrum, dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) frameworks such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) have emerged as practical solutions to improve utilization while protecting incumbent users (IUs) such as military radars. However, current incumbent protection mechanisms face critical limitations. The Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) requires costly sensor deployments and remains vulnerable to interference and security risks. Alternatively, the Incumbent Informing Capability (IIC) requires IUs to disclose their identities and operational parameters to the Spectrum Coordination System (SCS), creating linkable records that compromise operational privacy and mission secrecy. We propose IU-GUARD, a privacy-preserving spectrum sharing framework that enables IUs to access spectrum without revealing their identities. Leveraging verifiable credentials (VCs) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), IU-GUARD allows IUs to prove their authorization to the SCS while disclosing only essential operational parameters. This decouples IU identity from spectrum access, prevents cross-request linkage, and mitigates the risk of centralized SCS data leakage. We implement a prototype, and our evaluation shows that IU-GUARD achieves strong privacy guarantees with practical computation and communication overhead, making it suitable for real-time DSS deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "IU-GUARD\ub294 \ubb34\uc120 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uad70\uc6a9 \ub808\uc774\ub354\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790(IUs)\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \ub178\ucd9c \uc5c6\uc774 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb34\uc120 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc758 \uc218\uc694 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \uae30\uc874 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uacf5\uc720 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "IU-GUARD\ub294 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\uaca9 \uc99d\uba85(VCs)\uacfc \uc81c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\uba85(ZKPs)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec IUs\uac00 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \ub178\ucd9c \uc5c6\uc774 SCS\uc5d0 \uad8c\ud55c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \uad6c\ud604 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, IU-GUARD\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 IU-GUARD\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uacf5\uc720 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc120 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc2dc\ubbfc \uad11\ub300\uc5ed \ubb34\uc120 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4(CBRS)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uacf5\uc720(DSS) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uae30\uc874 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc778 \uad70\uc6a9 \ub808\uc774\ub354\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ud65c\uc6a9\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubcf4\ud638 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud658\uacbd \uac10\uc9c0 \uae30\ub2a5(ESC)\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70 \uac04\uc12d \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \uae30\uc874 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ub2a5(IIC)\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc870\uc815 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(SCS)\uc5d0 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6d0\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b4\uc601 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc640 \ubbf8\uc158 \uae30\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud611\ud558\ub294 \ub9c1\ud06c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6d0\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uacf5\uc720 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 IU-GUARD\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

To capture modern representation learning, we treat the state and action spaces as general compact metric spaces and assume Lipschitz policies. To explain the gap between worst-case hardness and empirical success, we introduce problem distributions generated by a reference policy $q$, including a latent-variable model in which proofs exhibit reusable cut/lemma/sketch structure represented by a proof DAG. Under a top-$k$ search protocol and Tsybakov-type margin conditions, we derive lower bounds on finite-horizon success probability that decompose into search and learning terms, with learning controlled by sequential Rademacher/covering complexity. Our main separation result shows that when cut elimination expands a DAG of depth $D$ into a cut-free tree of size $\u03a9(\u039b^D)$ while the cut-aware hierarchical process has size $O(\u03bb^D)$ with $\u03bb\\ll\u039b$, a flat (cut-free) learner provably requires exponentially more data than a cut-aware hierarchical learner.

A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger.

We propose RI-FedAvg, a novel FL algorithm that mitigates client drift by incorporating a Roughness Index (RI)-based regularization term into the local objective, adaptively penalizing updates based on the fluctuations of local loss landscapes. This paper introduces RI-FedAvg, leveraging the RI to quantify the roughness of high-dimensional loss functions, ensuring robust optimization in heterogeneous settings. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for non-convex objectives, establishing that RI-FedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that RI-FedAvg outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn, SCAFFOLD, and DP-FedAvg, achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence in non-IID scenarios.

However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows. Our results demonstrate a generalizable paradigm: leveraging physical insight to transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations can enable rapid and robust

In this paper, we propose CycFlow, a framework that replaces iterative edge denoising with deterministic point transport. CycFlow learns an instance-conditioned vector field that continuously transports input 2D coordinates to a canonical circular arrangement, where the optimal tour is recovered from this $2N$ dimensional representation via angular sorting. By leveraging data-dependent flow matching, we bypass the quadratic bottleneck of edge scoring in favor of linear coordinate dynamics.

Text-based parsers often discard layout semantics and introduce unstructured noise, while long-horizon training typically relies on sparse outcome rewards that obscure which retrieval actions actually matter. We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments.

However, controlling the composition of multiple pre-trained models remains an open challenge. Current approaches largely treat composition as an algebraic composition of probability densities, such as via products or mixtures of experts. This perspective assumes the target distribution is known explicitly, which is almost never the case. In this work, we propose a different paradigm that formulates compositional generation as a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem. Rather than combining probability densities, we treat pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered, via optimal control, toward a shared objective defined on their aggregated output. We validate our framework on conditional MNIST generation and compare it against a naive inference-time DPS-style baseline replacing learned cooperative control with per-step gradient guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc6d0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc11c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc9d1\ud569 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uc720 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc870\uac74\ubd80 MNIST \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc548\ub0b4\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud55c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 DPS \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubcf5\uc6d0 \ubc0f \ud569\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uad6c\uc131 \uc790\uccb4\ub97c \ud655\ub960 \ubc00\ub3c4\uc758 \ub300\uc218\uc801 \uc870\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad00\uc810\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc870\ud569 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud655\ub960 \ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc9d1\ud569 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uacf5\uc720 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud5a5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 MNIST \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc548\ub0b4\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud55c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 DPS \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts and could in principle be cached, naively caching their outputs for reuse is incorrect since tool outputs depend on the environment state induced by prior agent interactions. We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TVCACHE\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \ud234 \ud638\ucd9c\uc758 \uce90\uc2dc \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud638\ucd9c \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ub204\uc801\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "RL \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc774 \uba87 \ucd08\uc5d0\uc11c \uba87 \ubd84\uae4c\uc9c0 \uac78\ub824 GPU\ub97c \uc720\ud734 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TVCACHE\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ud234 \ud638\ucd9c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc758 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \uce90\uc2dc \uc870\ud68c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uac00\uc7a5 \uae34 \uc811\ub450\uc5b4 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "TVCACHE\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uce90\uc2dc \uc801\uc911\ub960\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 70%\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc911\uac04 \ud234 \ud638\ucd9c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 6.9\ubc30 \uc904\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf4\uc0c1 \ub204\uc801\uc5d0 \uc800\ud574 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "RL \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc740 \uba87 \ucd08\uc5d0\uc11c \uba87 \ubd84\uc774 \uc18c\uc694\ub418\uc5b4 \ud560\ub2f9\ub41c GPU\uac00 \uc720\ud734 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \ud234 \ud638\ucd9c\uc774 \ubcd1\ub82c \ub864\uc544\uc6c3 \uac04\uc5d0 \ubc18\ubcf5\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uce90\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud234 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc62c\ubc14\ub974\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc720\uc9c0\ud615 \ud234-\uac12 \uce90\uc2dc TWCACHE\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \ube44\uc120\ud638 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 OSIL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "OSIL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud638 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0, \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "OSIL\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc2dc\uc5f0\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc704 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc548\uc804 \ube44\uc6a9 \ub610\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5(IL) \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud53c\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \ube44\uc120\ud638 \uacbd\ub85c\ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ub978\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud638 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc548\uc804 IL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 OSIL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(CMDP)\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.

On Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) spot gold data (2005-2025), we construct two window-aligned views from each rolling window: an OHLCV-rendered price/volume chart and a technical-indicator matrix. To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae08\uc735 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc74c \ub0a0 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0, \ub3d9\uc77c \ucd9c\ucc98\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubdf0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae08\uc735 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c1\ud558\uc774 \uae08 \uac70\ub798\uc18c\uc758 \uc2a4\ud31f \uae08 \ub370\uc774\ud130(2005-2025)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec OHLCV \uac00\uaca9/\uac70\ub798\ub7c9 \ucc28\ud2b8\uc640 \uae30\uc220 \uc9c0\ud45c \ud589\ub82c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ucc3d \uc815\ub82c \ubdf0\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub204\uc218 \uc800\ud56d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc28\ub2e8 \ubd84\ud560\uacfc \ub9e4\ud29c \uc0c1\uad00 \uacc4\uc218(MCC)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\uba70, \ucd5c\uc18c \uc774\ub3d9 \ud544\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc74c \ub0a0 \uc808\ub300 \uc218\uc775\ub960\uc774 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac12 \uc774\ud558\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc81c\uc678\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uce35\uc801 \ud4e8\uc804 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacf5\ub3d9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae08\uc735 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc74c \ub0a0 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uc77c \ucd9c\ucc98 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubdf0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ud558\uc774 \uae08 \uac70\ub798\uc18c(SGE) \uc2a4\ud31f \uae08 \ub370\uc774\ud130(2005-2025)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \ub864\ub9c1 \ucc3d\uc5d0\uc11c OHLCV\ub85c \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\ub41c \uac00\uaca9/\uac70\ub798\ub7c9 \ucc28\ud2b8\uc640 \uae30\uc220 \uc9c0\ud45c \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ucc3d \uc815\ub82c \ubdf0\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub204\uc218 \uc800\ud56d \uc2dc\uac04 \ube14\ub85d \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \ub9e4\ud29c \uc0c1\uad00 \uacc4\uc218(MCC)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\ud604\ub41c \ub2e4\uc74c \ub0a0 \uc808\ub300 \uc218\uc775\ub960\uc774 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac12 \uc544\ub798\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc81c\uc678\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc774\ub3d9 \ud544\ud130\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uadfc\uc811 0 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc9c0\ub9cc \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e4\uba74\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ube44\ub2e8\uc870 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4;

In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered \"agent\", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster). Moreover, Pram exhibits strong robustness (<10\\% performance degradation under link failures or flow bursts), demonstrating MLM's generalization ability to unforeseen events. Pram is objective-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, providing a practical and scalable solution for future networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uacfc \ucc98\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 ML \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Pram\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uacfc \ucc98\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc870\ud654\ub86d\uac8c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ud604\ub300\uc758 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud655\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Pram\uc740 \uc6d0\ub798 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud558\uc704 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uace0, MLM \uae30\ubc18 '\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8'\ub85c \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c \ud6c4, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\uc5ed \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Pram\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uacf5\uac1c\ub41c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc194\ubc84\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub54c\ub85c\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uace0 1~2 \ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Pram\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc6d0\ud65c\ud558\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uba70 \ubbf8\ub798 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ud654\ubb3c \ud750\ub984(MCF) \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud750\ub984\uacfc \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc8fc\uc81c\ub85c, \uad50\ud1b5, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub958 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ub298\ub0a0 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uacfc \ucc98\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790\uc758 \ud070 \ud544\uc694\uc778 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 ML \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Pram\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\uc758 \uc77c\ud658\uc73c\ub85c Pram\uc740 (i) \uc6d0\ub798 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud558\uc704 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uc5b4 MLM \uae30\ubc18 '\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8'\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, (ii) \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc804\uc5ed \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, Pram\uc740 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud558\uac15\ubc95\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec MCF \ubb38\uc81c \uacc4\uc5f4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uac12\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uacf5\uac1c\ub41c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Pram\uc774 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc194\ubc84\uc5d0 \ud544\uc801\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc2ec\uc9c0\uc5b4 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc9e7\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(1~2 \ubc30 \ub354 \ube60\ub984). \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, Pram\uc740 \ub9c1\ud06c \uc2e4\ud328\ub098 \ud750\ub984 \uae09\uc99d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub0b4\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba70 (<10\">% \uc131\ub2a5 \uac10\uc18c), MLM\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Here we introduce the Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA), a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime. These results demonstrate that MKNA not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for autonomous, language-guided materials exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "MKNA\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uacfc\ud559 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uc7ac\ub8cc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uc7ac\ub8cc \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0, \uc804\uc790\uae30\uae30 \ubc0f \ud56d\uacf5\uc6b0\uc8fc \uae30\uc220\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc9c1\uad00\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MKNA\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \ub41c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \uac80\uc0c9, \uc18d\uc131 \uc608\uce21, \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uad6c\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "MKNA\ub294 \uace0-\ub514\ubc14\uc774 \uc628\ub3c4 \uc138\ub77c\ubbf9\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \ub370 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ub418\ub294 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd \uae30\uc900(Theta_D > 800 K)\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc774\uc544\ubaac\ub4dc, SiC, SiN \ubc0f BeO\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ucd08\uacbd\uc9c1 \uc7ac\ub8cc\ub97c \uc7ac\ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uace0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc5f4\uc5ed\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc815\ud55c Be-C \ud48d\ubd80 \ud654\ud569\ubb3c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MKNA\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \ucc3e\uc744 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc124\uacc4 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc7ac\ub8cc \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uc7ac\ub8cc \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0, \uc804\uc790\uae30\uae30 \ubc0f \ud56d\uacf5\uc6b0\uc8fc \uae30\uc220 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc9c1\uad00\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uacfc\ud559 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \uac80\uc0c9, \uc18d\uc131 \uc608\uce21, \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uad6c\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 \uc7ac\ub8cc \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(MKNA)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

By leveraging bidirectional attention through diffusion-based pretraining, our models capture comprehensive bidirectional context within passages, enabling the use of mean pooling and a late chunking strategy to better preserve global context across long documents. We release two model types: pplx-embed-v1 for standard retrieval, and pplx-embed-context-v1 for contextualized embeddings that incorporate global document context into passage representations. pplx-embed-v1 achieves competitive performance on the MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(Code), MIRACL, BERGEN, and ToolRet retrieval benchmarks, while pplx-embed-context-v1 sets new records on the ConTEB benchmark. Beyond public benchmarks, pplx-embed-v1 demonstrates strong performance on our internal evaluation suite, which focuses on real-world, large-scale search scenarios over tens of millions of documents. These results validate the models' effectiveness in production environments where retrieval quality and efficiency are critical at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "pplx-embed\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub300\ube44 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc138 \uac00\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc6f9 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \uc0ac\uc804\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc31\ubcf8\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc791\uc131\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "pplx-embed\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0, \ud3c9\uade0 \ud480\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ud6c4\uae30 \uccad\ud06c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae34 \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "pplx-embed-v1\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, pplx-embed-context-v1\uc740 ConTEB \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc138\uc6e0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6f9 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud655\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc31\ubcf8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac\uc778 pplx-embed\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uad6c\ubb38 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uade0 \ud480\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ud6c4\uae30 \uccad\ud06c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae34 \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\uc5ed \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ubcf4\uc874\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c pplx-embed-v1\uacfc \uc804\uccb4 \ubb38\uc11c \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uad6c\ubb38 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\ud654 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc704\ud55c pplx-embed-context-v1\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ucd9c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. pplx-embed-v1\uc740 MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(Code), MIRACL, BERGEN \ubc0f ToolRet \uac80\uc0c9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, pplx-embed-context-v1\uc740 ConTEB \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uacf5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 pplx-embed-v1\uc740 \uc218\ucc9c\ub9cc \uac1c\uc758 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc2a4\uc704\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
