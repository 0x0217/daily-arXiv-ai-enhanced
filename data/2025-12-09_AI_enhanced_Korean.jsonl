While state of the art unlearning methods have emerged in response, they typically treat all points in the forget set equally. In this work, we challenge this approach by asking whether points that have a negligible impact on the model's learning need to be removed. Through a comparative analysis of influence functions across language and vision tasks, we identify subsets of training data with negligible impact on model outputs. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient unlearning framework that reduces the size of datasets before unlearning leading to significant computational savings (up to approximately 50 percent) on real world empirical examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc9c8\ubb38\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5b8\ub7ec\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5b8\ub7ec\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uc904\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ucd5c\ub300 \uc57d 50%\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc808\uc57d\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub294 \uc81c\uac70\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294 \uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \ub354\uc6b1 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5b8\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ucee4\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \uc5b8\ub7ec\ub2dd\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc5b8\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0dd\uaca8\ub0ac\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc78a\uc5b4\uc57c \ud560 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac8c \ucde8\uae09\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc9c8\ubb38\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubc0f \ube44\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc5b8\ub7ec\ub2dd\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5b8\ub7ec\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 \uc57d 50%\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \uc774\ub8ec\ub2e4."}}

While detecting LLM-generated text has been extensively studied, distinguishing human vs LLM-generated scientific idea remains an unexplored area. In this work, we systematically evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning models to differentiate between human and LLM-generated ideas, particularly after successive paraphrasing stages. Our findings highlight the challenges SOTA models face in source attribution, with detection performance declining by an average of 25.4\\% after five consecutive paraphrasing stages. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the research problem as contextual information improves detection performance by up to 2.97%.

Nevertheless, LLM-driven generation remains challenging: the token-level design loop is discrete and non-differentiable, preventing feedback from smoothly guiding architectural improvement. These methods, in turn, commonly suffer from mode collapse into redundant structures or drift toward infeasible designs when constructive reasoning is not well grounded. We introduce RevoNAD, a reflective evolutionary orchestrator that effectively bridges LLM-based reasoning with feedback-aligned architectural search. First, RevoNAD presents a Multi-round Multi-expert Consensus to transfer isolated design rules into meaningful architectural clues. Then, Adaptive Reflective Exploration adjusts the degree of exploration leveraging reward variance; it explores when feedback is uncertain and refines when stability is reached.

Code and reproducible experiments are available at: https://github.com/zubair0831/ensemble-generalization-gap", "summary": "Ensemble models often achieve higher accuracy than single learners, but their ability to maintain small generalization gaps is not always well understood. This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively. Overall, the study provides a clear view of how and when ensembles maintain high accuracy while keeping overfitting low, offering practical guidance for model selection in real world tabular

In this setting, each agent's reward depends on its own state-action pair as well as those of its direct neighbors, and each agent's policy is parameterized by its local parameters together with those of its $\u03ba_{p}$-hop neighbors, with $\u03ba_{p}\\geq 1$ denoting the coupled radius. The objective of the agents is to collaboratively optimize their policies to maximize the discounted average cumulative reward. To address the challenge of interdependent policies in collaborative optimization, we introduce a novel concept termed the neighbors' averaged $Q$-function and derive a new expression for the coupled policy gradient. Based on these theoretical foundations, we develop a distributed scalable coupled policy (DSCP) algorithm, where each agent relies only on the state-action pairs of its $\u03ba_{p}$-hop neighbors and the rewards its their $(\u03ba_{p}+1)$-hop neighbors. Specially, in the DSCP algorithm, we employ a geometric 2-horizon sampling method that does not require storing a full $Q$-table to obtain an unbiased estimate of the coupled policy gradient. Moreover, each agent interacts exclusively with its direct neighbors to obtain accurate policy parameters, while maintaining local estimates of other agents' parameters to execute its local policy and collect samples for optimization. These estimates and policy parameters are updated via a push-sum protocol, enabling distributed coordination of policy updates across the network. We prove that the joint policy produced by the proposed algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective function. Finally, the effectiveness of DSCP algorithm is demonstrated through simulations in a robot path planning environment, showing clear improvement over state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

This paper introduces a large-language-model (LLM)-driven conversational assistant that captures such knowledge on the shop floor and converts it incrementally and interactively into standards-compliant Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 diagrams. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro and delivered through a lightweight Gradio front-end with client-side bpmn-js visualisation, the assistant conducts an interview-style dialogue: it elicits process details, supports clarifying dialogue and on-demand analysis, and renders live diagrams that users can refine in real time. A proof-of-concept evaluation in an equipment-maintenance scenario shows that the chatbot produced an accurate \"AS-IS\" model, flagged issues via on-diagram annotations, and generated an improved \"TO-BE\" variant, all within about 12-minutes, while keeping API costs within an SME-friendly budget. The study analyses latency sources, model-selection trade-offs, and the challenges of enforcing strict XML schemas, then outlines a roadmap toward agentic and multimodal deployments. The results demonstrate that conversational LLMs can potentially be used to lower the skill and cost barriers to rigorous process documentation, helping SMEs preserve institutional knowledge, enhance operational transparency, and accelerate continuous-improvement efforts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uc774 \uacaa\ub294 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad00\ub9ac \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud654\ud615 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub3c4\uc6b0\ubbf8\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc740 \uacf5\uc2dd \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Gemini 2.5 Pro\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21 bpmn-js \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uacbd\ub7c9 Gradio \ud504\ub860\ud2b8-end\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ub3c4\uc6b0\ubbf8\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub3c4\uc6b0\ubbf8\ub294 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc138\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \uba85\ud655\ud654 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uace0, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc7a5\ube44 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc57\ubd07\uc740 \uc57d 12\ubd84 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c 'AS-IS' \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud45c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c 'TO-BE' \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub300\ud654\ud615 LLM\uc774 \uacfc\uc815 \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\uc758 \uae30\uc220 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd9c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uc774 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubcf4\uc874, \uc6b4\uc601 \ud22c\uba85\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uac1c\uc120 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5(SME)\uc740 \uacf5\uc2dd \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub178\ud558\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud604\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c BPMN 2.0 \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ub3c4\uc6b0\ubbf8\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This promise is stunted by significant risks - policy violations, process corruption, and security flaws - that stem from the lack of visibility and mechanisms to manage undesirable data flows produced by agent actions. Today, agent workflows are responsible for enforcing these policies in ad hoc ways. Just as data validation and access controls shifted from the application to the DBMS, freeing application developers from these concerns, we argue that systems should support Data Flow Controls (DFCs) and enforce DFC policies natively.

We present \\textbf{GRASP} -- a multi-agent, graph-reasoning framework with a human-in-the-loop conversational interface -- that encodes QSP models as typed biological knowledge graphs and compiles them to executable MATLAB/SimBiology code while preserving units, mass balance, and physiological constraints. A two-phase workflow -- \\textsc{Understanding} (graph reconstruction of legacy code) and \\textsc{Action} (constraint-checked, language-driven modification) -- is orchestrated by a state machine with iterative validation. GRASP performs breadth-first parameter-alignment around new entities to surface dependent quantities and propose biologically plausible defaults, and it runs automatic execution/diagnostics until convergence. In head-to-head evaluations using LLM-as-judge, GRASP outperforms SME-guided CoT and ToT baselines across biological plausibility, mathematical correctness, structural fidelity, and code quality (\\(\\approx\\)9--10/10 vs.\\ 5--7/10).

We present Omega, a system that enables trusted AI agents by enforcing end-to-end isolation, establishing verifiable trust across all contributing principals, and supervising every external interaction with accountable provenance. Omega builds on Confidential VMs and Confidential GPUs to create a Trusted Agent Platform that hosts many agents within a single CVM using nested isolation. It also provides efficient multi-agent orchestration with cross-principal trust establishment via differential attestation, and a policy specification and enforcement framework that governs data access, tool usage, and inter-agent communication for data protection and regulatory compliance.

This paper introduces a completely innovative architecture and concept: combining the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a specific clinical application, known as MCP-AI. This integration allows intelligent agents to reason over extended periods, collaborate securely, and adhere to authentic clinical logic, representing a significant shift away from traditional Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and prompt-based Large Language Models (LLMs). As healthcare systems become more complex, the need for autonomous, context-aware clinical reasoning frameworks has become urgent. We present MCP-AI, a novel architecture for explainable medical decision-making built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP) a modular, executable specification for orchestrating generative and descriptive AI agents in real-time workflows. Each MCP file captures clinical objectives, patient context, reasoning state, and task logic, forming a reusable and auditable memory object. Unlike conventional CDSS or stateless prompt-based AI systems, MCP-AI supports adaptive, longitudinal, and collaborative reasoning across care settings. MCP-AI is validated through two use cases: (1) diagnostic modeling of Fragile X Syndrome with comorbid depression, and (2) remote coordination for Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. In either scenario, the protocol facilitates physician-in-the-loop validation, streamlines clinical processes, and guarantees secure transitions of AI responsibilities between healthcare providers.

We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, network locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks(ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics.

AAAI 2026 FAST Workshop (Oral)", "summary": "Large language models display a peculiar form of inconsistency: they \"know\" the correct answer but fail to act on it. In human philosophy, this tension between global judgment and local impulse is called akrasia, or weakness of will. We propose akrasia as a foundational concept for analyzing inconsistency and goal drift in agentic AI systems. To operationalize it, we introduce a preliminary version of the Akrasia Benchmark, currently a structured set of prompting conditions (Baseline [B], Synonym [S], Temporal [T], and Temptation [X]) that measures when a model's local response contradicts its own prior commitments. The benchmark enables quantitative comparison of \"self-control\" across model families, decoding strategies, and temptation types. Beyond single-model evaluation, we outline how micro-level akrasia may compound into macro-level instability in multi-agent systems that may be interpreted as \"scheming\" or deliberate misalignment.

KANFormer combines a Dilated Causal Convolutional network with a Transformer encoder, enhanced by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which improve nonlinear approximation. Unlike existing models that rely solely on a series of snapshots of the limit order book, KANFormer integrates the actions of agents related to LOB dynamics and the position of the order in the queue to more effectively capture patterns related to execution likelihood. We evaluate the model using CAC 40 index futures data with labeled orders.

In this work, we propose the Executor-Analyst Framework, a modular architecture that decouples the syntactic precision of tool execution from the semantic robustness of clinical reasoning. By orchestrating specialized TxAgents (Executors) with long-context foundation models (Analysts), we mitigate the reasoning deficits observed in monolithic models. Beyond simple modularity, we demonstrate that a Stratified Ensemble strategy significantly outperforms global pooling by preserving evidentiary diversity, effectively addressing the information bottleneck. Furthermore, our stress tests reveal critical scaling insights: (1) a \\textit{Context-Performance Paradox}, where extending reasoning contexts beyond 12k tokens introduces noise that degrades accuracy; and (2) the \\textit{Curse of Dimensionality} in action spaces, where expanding toolsets necessitates hierarchical retrieval strategies. Crucially, our approach underscores the potential of training-free architectural engineering, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CURE-Bench without the need for expensive end-to-end finetuning.

Chang"], "title": "The Missing Layer of AGI: From Pattern Alchemy to Coordination Physics", "comment": "13 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Influential critiques argue that Large Language Models (LLMs) are a dead end for AGI: \"mere pattern matchers\" structurally incapable of reasoning or planning. We argue this conclusion misidentifies the bottleneck: it confuses the ocean with the net. Pattern repositories are the necessary System-1 substrate; the missing component is a System-2 coordination layer that selects, constrains, and binds these patterns. We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while \"reasoning\" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory).

This work introduces a Multimodal Oncology Agent (MOA) integrating a histology tool based on the TITAN foundation model for IDH1 mutation prediction in low-grade glioma, combined with reasoning over structured clinical and genomic inputs through PubMed, Google Search, and OncoKB. MOA reports were quantitatively evaluated on 488 patients from the TCGA-LGG cohort against clinical and histology baselines. MOA without the histology tool outperformed the clinical baseline, achieving an F1-score of 0.826 compared to 0.798. When fused with histology features, MOA reached the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.912, exceeding both the histology baseline at 0.894 and the fused histology-clinical baseline at 0.897.

However, estimating personalized networks typically requires intensive longitudinal data, which is not always feasible. A solution to facilitate scalability of network-driven treatment personalization is leveraging LLMs. In this study, we present an end-to-end pipeline for automatically generating client networks from 77 therapy transcripts to support case conceptualization and treatment planning. We annotated 3364 psychological processes and their corresponding dimensions in therapy transcripts. Using these data, we applied in-context learning to jointly identify psychological processes and their dimensions. The method achieved high performance even with a few training examples. To organize the processes into networks, we introduced a two-step method that grouped them into clinically meaningful clusters. We then generated explanation-augmented relationships between clusters. Experts found that networks produced by our multi-step approach outperformed those built with direct prompting for clinical utility and interpretability, with up to 90% preferring our approach. In addition, the networks were rated favorably by experts, with scores for clinical relevance, novelty, and usefulness ranging from 72-75%. Our findings provide a proof of concept for using LLMs to create clinically relevant networks from therapy transcripts. Advantages of our approach include bottom-up case conceptualization from client utterances in therapy sessions and identification of latent themes. Networks generated from our pipeline may be used in clinical settings and supervision and training. Future research should examine whether these networks improve treatment outcomes relative to other methods of treatment personalization, including statistically estimated networks.", "AI": {"tldr":

These domains demand conceptual understanding, symbolic reasoning, and adherence to formal laws, requirements that most existing benchmarks fail to address. In particular, current datasets tend to be static, lacking intermediate reasoning steps, robustness to variations, or mechanisms for verifying scientific correctness. To address these limitations, we introduce PRiSM, a synthetic, fully dynamic, and multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning via grounded Python code. PRiSM includes over 24,750 university-level physics and math problems, and it leverages our scalable agent-based pipeline, PrismAgent, to generate well-structured problem instances. Each problem contains dynamic textual and visual input, a generated figure, alongside rich structured outputs: executable Python code for ground truth generation and verification, and detailed step-by-step reasoning. The dynamic nature and Python-powered automated ground truth generation of our benchmark allow for fine-grained experimental auditing of multimodal VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and limitations in scientific reasoning. To this end, we propose five targeted evaluation tasks covering generalization, symbolic program synthesis, perturbation robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution. Through comprehensive evaluation of existing VLMs, we highlight their limitations and showcase how PRiSM enables deeper insights into their scientific reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRiSM\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 24,750\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ubc0f \uc218\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ucd5c\uc885 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "PRiSM\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc785\ub825, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ub3c4\ud45c \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "PRiSM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874 VLM\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae4a\uc740 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PRiSM\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 VLM\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub420 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ucd5c\uc885 \ub2f5\ubcc0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uc774\ud574, \uae30\ud638\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801 \ubc95\uce59 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ud604\uc7ac \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4, \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131, \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 PRiSM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud569\uc131\uc758 \uc644\uc804 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Each problem is fully parameterized, supporting an effectively infinite range of input configurations, and is accompanied by structured, step-by-step reasoning and executable Python code that produces the ground-truth solution for any parameter set. The benchmark contains three question types: MC-Symbolic (multiple-choice with symbolic options), MC-Numerical (multiple-choice with numerical options), and free-form (open-ended responses). These diverse formats test complementary reasoning skills. By leveraging the dynamic, code-driven nature of the benchmark, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics in addition to standard accuracy: Consistency Score, Failure Rate, and Confusion Rate, that quantify variability and uncertainty across problem variants. Experiments with state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models reveal both strengths and limitations in scientific reasoning, positioning SymPyBench as a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable reasoning systems", "AI": {"tldr": "15,045\uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud559 \uc218\uc900 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud569\uc131 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38 \ud615\uc2dd\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud559 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc804\uccb4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb34\ud55c\ud55c \uc785\ub825 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c Python \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc720\ud615(MC-\uae30\ud638, MC-\uc218\uce58, \uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd)\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc870\uc815 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uba70, SymPyBench\uac00 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SymPyBench\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 15,045\uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud559 \uc218\uc900 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c(90/10% \ud6c8\ub828/\ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ud560)\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud569\uc131 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb34\ud55c\ud55c \uc785\ub825 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ub2f5 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c Python \ucf54\ub4dc\uac00 \ud568\uaed8 \uc81c\uacf5\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc720\ud615: MC-\uae30\ud638(\uae30\ud638 \uc120\ud0dd\ud615 \ub2e4\uc9c0\uc120\ub2e4), MC-\uc218\uce58(\uc218\uce58 \uc120\ud0dd\ud615 \ub2e4\uc9c0\uc120\ub2e4) \ubc0f \uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd(\uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc751\ub2f5)\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\uc900 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc678\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc778 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc810\uc218, \uc2e4\ud328\uc728 \ubc0f \ud63c\ub780\ub960\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc870\uc815 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uba70, SymPyBench\uac00 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
