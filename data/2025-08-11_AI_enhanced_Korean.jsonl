Yet a collection of safe agents does not guarantee a safe\ncollection of agents, as interactions between agents over time create emergent\nbehaviours and induce novel failure modes. This means multi-agent systems\nrequire a fundamentally different risk analysis approach than that used for a\nsingle agent.\n  This report addresses the early stages of risk identification and analysis\nfor multi-agent AI systems operating within governed environments where\norganisations control their agent configurations and deployment. In this\nsetting, we examine six critical failure modes: cascading reliability failures,\ninter-agent communication failures, monoculture collapse, conformity bias,\ndeficient theory of mind, and mixed motive dynamics. For each, we provide a\ntoolkit for practitioners to extend or integrate into their existing frameworks\nto assess these failure modes within their organisational contexts.\n  Given fundamental limitations in current LLM behavioural understanding, our\napproach centres on analysis validity, and advocates for progressively\nincreasing validity through staged testing across stages of abstraction and\ndeployment that gradually increases exposure to potential negative impacts,\nwhile collecting convergent evidence through simulation, observational\nanalysis, benchmarking, and red teaming. This methodology establishes the\ngroundwork for robust organisational risk management as these LLM-based\nmulti-agent systems are deployed and operated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc870\uc9c1\ub4e4\uc774 LLM

Traditional rule-based systems and\nnumerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and\nadaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces\nGrid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language\nModels (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate\ngrid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with\nnumerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent\ngenerates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers,\nwhile a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness\nvia sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability,\nGrid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that\ndynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and\ncomplexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through\noptimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment\nstrategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE\n69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation\nperformance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and\nlearning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse\nnetwork topologies.

Existing online methods either rely on simple heuristics, which result in\npoor decisions, or employ complex reasoning, which suffers from limited\nscalability under real-time constraints. In this work, we focus on the task\nassignment subproblem and formulate it as a minimum-cost flow over the\nenvironment graph. This eliminates the need for pairwise distance computations\nand allows agents to be simultaneously assigned to tasks and routed toward\nthem. The resulting flow network also supports efficient guide path extraction\nto integrate with the planner and accelerates planning under real-time\nconstraints. To improve solution quality, we introduce two congestion-aware\nedge cost models that incorporate real-time traffic estimates.

A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding\nnatural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which\naccurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a\ncorrect semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally\nappropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these\nMLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,\nwhich prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address\nthis exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization\n(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer\ngeneration strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a\ntheoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from\nfirst principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B\nand InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple\nchallenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative\nimprovements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks\ndesigned to test generalization and semantic understanding.

However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited\nin their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention\nstrategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network\ncentrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose\nDiagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory\nsystem dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal\nuser input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,\nflows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information\nalready encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate\nhypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under\nuncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and\nlow-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed\nfrom the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with\nthe data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing\nuncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is\nimplemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to\nsupport further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for\nresearchers working with CLDs.

We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on\npost-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations.\nWe present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the\nsystem's core design through transparent belief representations and\nhierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a\nmedium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human\noversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture\nimplements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active\nInference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through\nhierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring\nsafety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in\nnatural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy\nminimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.\nThe paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and\nReasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our\nframework's safety properties.

We constructed a database of 659\ndistinct physical equations, subjected to rigorous semantic cleaning to resolve\nnotational ambiguities, resulting in a corpus of 400 advanced physics\nequations. We developed an enhanced graph representation where both physical\nconcepts and equations are nodes, connected by weighted inter-equation bridges.\nThese weights are objectively defined using normalized metrics for variable\noverlap, physics-informed importance scores, and bibliometric data. A Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) was trained for link prediction, achieving a test AUC\nof 0.9742 +/- 0.0018 across five independent runs, significantly outperforming\nboth classical heuristics (best baseline AUC: 0.9487) and established GNN\narchitectures like GraphSAGE (AUC: 0.9504, p = 0.029). Statistical testing\nconfirmed significance of all comparisons (p < 0.05), with 2.7% improvement\nover the best baseline. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) The model\nautonomously rediscovers the known macroscopic structure of physics,\nidentifying strong conceptual axes between Electromagnetism and Statistical\nMechanics. (ii) It identifies central hub equations that serve as critical\nbridges between multiple physical domains.

The\nrecent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new tools and challenges\nfor the security of computer systems; In this work, we investigate whether\nclassical game-theoretic frameworks can effectively capture the behaviours of\nLLM-driven actors and bots. Using a reproducible framework for game-theoretic\nLLM agents, we investigate two canonical scenarios -- the one-shot zero-sum\ngame and the dynamic Prisoner's Dilemma -- and we test whether LLMs converge to\nexpected outcomes or exhibit deviations due to embedded biases. Our experiments\ninvolve four state-of-the-art LLMs and span five natural languages, English,\nFrench, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Mandarin Chinese, to assess linguistic\nsensitivity. For both games, we observe that the final payoffs are influenced\nby agents characteristics such as personality traits or knowledge of repeated\nrounds. Moreover, we uncover an unexpected sensitivity of the final payoffs to\nthe choice of languages, which should warn against indiscriminate application\nof LLMs in cybersecurity applications and call for in-depth studies, as LLMs\nmay behave differently when deployed in different countries. We also employ\nquantitative metrics to evaluate the internal consistency and cross-language\nstability of LLM agents, to help guide the selection of the most stable LLMs\nand optimising models for

The trajectory of the\nnudged system approaches the true system trajectory over time, even when the\ninitial conditions differ. For linear state space models, such control terms\ncan be derived under mild assumptions. However, designing effective nudging\nterms becomes significantly more challenging in the nonlinear setting. In this\nwork, we propose neural network nudging, a data-driven method for learning\nnudging terms in nonlinear state space models. We establish a theoretical\nexistence result based on the Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger observer theory.\nThe proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark problems that exhibit\nchaotic behavior: the Lorenz 96 model, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and\nthe Kolmogorov flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub108\uc9d5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ub108\uc9d5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub108\uc9d5 \ud56d\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub108\uc9d5 \ud56d\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ub108\uc9d5\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud63c\ub3c8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: Lorenz 96 \ubaa8\ub378, Kuramoto--Sivashinsky \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd, Kolmogorov \ud750\ub984.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub108\uc9d5 \ud56d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub108\uc9d5\uc740 \uad00\ucc30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud56d\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub3d9\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd08\uae30 \uc870\uac74\uc774 \ub2e4\ub974\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \ub108\uc9d5\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uada4\uc801\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c4\uc9dc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uada4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc120\ud615 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud56d\uc740 \uc57d\ud55c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub3c4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub108\uc9d5 \ud56d\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub108\uc9d5 \ud56d\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ub108\uc9d5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger \uad00\uce21\uc790 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc874\uc7ac \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uac15\ud55c \ud63c\ub3c8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4: Lorenz 96 \ubaa8\ub378, Kuramoto--Sivashinsky \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \ubc0f Kolmogorov \ud750\ub984."}}

However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources\nwith varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in\ncollaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework\nthat reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating\nheterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally\ngoverned by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical\ninfrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the\nsystem in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly\nleveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent\nreconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data\nquality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware\ninference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect\ninputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for\noperator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled\nwith hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational\nconstraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology\nrequirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components\nensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid,\nenabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under\nreal-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using\ndata from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory,\ndemonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and

In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent\nbuilt on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts\nthat simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on\nsingle-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts\ndynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion\nstrategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety\nguardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective\nagainst such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level\nsafeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered\nincrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the\ntransformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern\ntext-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our\nfindings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level\ncontrol frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational\ndeception powered by generative AI.",

First, we present CTFJudge, a framework leveraging LLM as a judge to\nanalyze agent trajectories and provide granular evaluation across CTF solving\nsteps. Second, we propose a novel metric, CTF Competency Index (CCI) for\npartial correctness, revealing how closely agent solutions align with\nhuman-crafted gold standards. Third, we examine how LLM hyperparameters, namely\ntemperature, top-p, and maximum token length, influence agent performance and\nautomated cybersecurity task planning. For rapid evaluation, we present\nCTFTiny, a curated benchmark of 50 representative CTF challenges across binary\nexploitation, web, reverse engineering, forensics, and cryptography.

Embodied navigation requires an agent to\nperceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a\nspecified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied\nnavigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given\ntheir deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of\nsuch systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of\nsafety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack\nstrategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting\na comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation\ntechnologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and\nrobustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in\nembodied navigation safety.

While\npowerful cloud-based LLMs offer superior optimization capabilities, they pose\nunacceptable intellectual property (IP) leakage risks when processing\nproprietary hardware designs. In this paper, we propose a new scenario where\nVerilog code must be optimized for specific attributes without leaking\nsensitive IP information. We introduce the first IP-preserving edge-cloud\ncollaborative framework that leverages the benefits of both paradigms. Our\napproach employs local small LLMs (e.g., Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B) to perform secure\ncomparative analysis between paired high-quality target designs and novice\ndraft codes, yielding general design principles that summarize key insights for\nimprovements. These principles are then used to query stronger cloud LLMs\n(e.g., Deepseek-V3) for targeted code improvement, ensuring that only\nabstracted and IP-safe guidance reaches external services. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that the framework achieves significantly higher\noptimization success rates compared to baseline methods. For example, combining\nQwen-2.5-Coder-7B and Deepseek-V3 achieves a 66.67\\% optimization success rate\nfor power utilization, outperforming Deepseek-V3 alone (49.81\\%) and even\ncommercial models like GPT-4o (55.81\\%). Further investigation of local and\ncloud LLM combinations reveals that different model pairings exhibit varying\nstrengths for specific optimization objectives, with interesting trends\nemerging when varying the number of comparative code pairs.

Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains\nunderexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on\nsimilarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly\nlimits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool\nretrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and\ntheir functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of\n1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools,\nenabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks.\nWe evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across\nsix defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue\nsynthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool\ngraph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete\nRecall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid\nretrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings\nsupport our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides\ncomplementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries\nrequiring sequential tool composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uac80\uc0c9\uc744

Existing methods often struggle with capturing nuanced\ndomain-specific terminology, modeling long-range dependencies, adapting to\ntemporal evolution, and scaling to massive datasets. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph\nRepresentation Enhancement) with Graphormer. Our approach leverages a large\nlanguage model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, within the TAPE framework to\ngenerate semantically rich explanations from paper content, which are then\nfused into enhanced node representations. These embeddings are combined with\nstructural features using a novel integration layer with learned attention\nweights. Graphormer's path-aware position encoding and multi-head attention\nmechanisms are employed to effectively capture long-range dependencies across\nthe citation network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the\nchallenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a\nclassification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN\nbaseline of 0.713. Our method also yields strong results in precision (0.671),\nrecall (0.577), and F1-score (0.610). We validate our approach through\ncomprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contribution of each\ncomponent, demonstrating the synergy between semantic and structural\ninformation. Our framework provides a scalable and robust solution for node\nclassification in dynamic TAGs, offering a promising direction for future\nresearch in knowledge systems and scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 TAPE\uc640 Graphormer \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc6a9 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc18d\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(TAG)\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "TAPE\uc640 Graphormer\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, ChatGPT\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \ub17c\ubb38 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95.", "result": "ogbn-arxiv \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c 0.772\uc758 \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, GCN \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\uc758 0.713\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 TAG\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc18d\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(TAG)\ub294 \uc778\uc6a9 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc6a9\uc5b4 \ud3ec\ucc29, \uc7a5\uae30 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc801\uc751, \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\uc885 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 TAPE(\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc18d\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud5a5\uc0c1)\uc640 Graphormer\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 TAPE \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM), \ud2b9\ud788 ChatGPT\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub17c\ubb38 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc99d\uac15\ub41c \ub178\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc735\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc8fc\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ud569 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, their safety and robustness remain unresolved. This study\nperforms a comprehensive evaluation on adversarial attack methods to identify\nand analyze their potential vulnerabilities. We formulate the diagnosis process\nas a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state is the patient responses\nand unasked questions, and the action is either to ask a question or to make a\ndiagnosis. We implemented six prevailing major attack methods, including the\nFast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Carlini &\nWagner Attack (C&W) attack, Basic Iterative Method (BIM), DeepFool, and\nAutoAttack, with seven epsilon values each. To ensure the generated adversarial\nexamples remain clinically plausible, we developed a comprehensive medical\nvalidation framework consisting of 247 medical constraints, including\nphysiological bounds, symptom correlations, and conditional medical\nconstraints. We achieved a 97.6% success rate in generating clinically\nplausible adversarial samples. We performed our experiment on the National\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/), which\nconsists of 182,630 samples, to predict the participant's 4-year mortality\nrate.

We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose\nand domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the\nstrength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within\ndistinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent.\nWe validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks,\ndemonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training.

In addition to maintaining acceptable collision\nrisks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by\nmaking early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete\naction and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when\nto initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for\nconjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The\nMarkov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the\nreliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which\nincreases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked\nconjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation\nstudy on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP.

In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2),\nagents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield\nsituations in a partially observable environment. This often overwhelms\nexisiting LLM-based approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a\nhierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning\nagents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP). By expert\ndemonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as\naerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured\nmultistep action sequences.

Traditional detection\nmethods, primarily text-based, often fall short due to the deceptive interplay\nbetween misleading text and images. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)\noffer promising avenues for multi-modal understanding, effectively fusing\ndiverse modal information, especially when their importance is imbalanced or\ncontradictory, remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces\nMM-FusionNet, an innovative framework leveraging LVLMs for robust multi-modal\nfake news detection. Our core contribution is the Context-Aware Dynamic Fusion\nModule (CADFM), which employs bi-directional cross-modal attention and a novel\ndynamic modal gating network. This mechanism adaptively learns and assigns\nimportance weights to textual and visual features based on their contextual\nrelevance, enabling intelligent prioritization of information. Evaluated on the\nlarge-scale Multi-modal Fake News Dataset (LMFND) comprising 80,000 samples,\nMM-FusionNet achieves a state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.938, surpassing existing\nmulti-modal baselines by approximately 0.5% and significantly outperforming\nsingle-modal approaches. Further analysis demonstrates the model's dynamic\nweighting capabilities, its robustness to modality perturbations, and\nperformance remarkably close to human-level, underscoring its

Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit\na dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises\nbetween fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the\ndual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order\nderivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the\nregularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on\nStatistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be\napplied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time\nseries. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a\ndenoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been\nconsidered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal\nfirst and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly.\nJointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with\nheteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear\nunconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have\nsequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function\nhyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic\nprocess without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the\nhyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states\nby stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be\nrepresented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast\nboth mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time\nseries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\ub97c \ud3c9\uade0\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc774\uc911

However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as\ndatabase intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise.\nInternal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it\neasier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external\nmasqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the\norganization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect\nanomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences\nof operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent\nnormal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble\nnormal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to\nidentify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for\nStructured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient,\npre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised\nmachine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while\nminimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses\nensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned\nnormal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope\nqueries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based\nmodels to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using\nrole-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings\nmake a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for\nsafeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to\nmentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links\nthat serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction.\nOur position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly\nunderestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current\ncapabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary\ncontexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the\ncontext for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable.\nThus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater\nattention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in\nartificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination,\nwe propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can\nlearn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal\nrelationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they\nensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach\nthat allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of\ninterrelated facts glued together with causal relations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc0ac\uace0\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774\uba70, \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uacfc\uc18c\ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 AI\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud5c8\uad6c\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \uc6d0\uc778 \uad00\uacc4\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc0ac\uc2e4\ub4e4\uc758 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc870\uc791\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ucf00 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ucd09\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub3cc\ud30c\uad6c\uac00 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc0ac\uace0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\uc0c1\uc758 \uc77c\uc885\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 '\uba38\ub9ac \uc18d\uc758 \uadf8\ub9bc'\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0c1\uc0c1\uc774 \uc544\ub2d9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc774\uc131\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0, \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubc0f \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uacfc \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc815\uc2e0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud06c\uac8c \uacfc\uc18c\ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 AI \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc778\uac04\uc740 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \ub54c \ud5c8\uad6c\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ubc30\uacbd \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778\uc9c0 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc73c\ub85c \ub04a\uc784\uc5c6\uc774 \ub3cc\uc544\uc635\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825 \uc5c6\uc774 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub9f9\ubaa9\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub3cc\ud30c\uad6c\ub85c\uc11c \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc5d0 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uae30\uc6b8\uc77c \uac83\uc744 \ucd09\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\ucc98\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud5c8\uad6c\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc0ac\uc2e4\ub4e4\uc758 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc870\uc791\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To our knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate\nfingerprinting for provenance attribution under such a threat model. The\nmethods rely on a trusted verifier that extracts secret fingerprints from the\nmodel's output space, unknown to the provider, and trains a model to predict\nand verify them. Our empirical evaluation shows that our methods achieve\nnear-zero FPR@95%TPR for instances of GAN and diffusion models, even when\ntested on small modifications to the original architecture and training data.\nMoreover, the methods remain robust against adversarial attacks that actively\nmodify the outputs to bypass detection.

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm\nreuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,\ncombined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning\ncriteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:\n(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree\nlearning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search\nstrategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several\ninstantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k\nheuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap\nintegral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that\nCA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime\nperformance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom\nalgorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc740 NP-hard \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c anytime \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uad50\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CA-DL8.5\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ud574\ub2f9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c anytime \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc740 NP-hard \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uc788\ub294 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "CA-DL8.5\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc644\uc804\ud55c anytime \ube54 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ubc0f \uc774\uc644 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \uc124\uacc4\ub85c \uc774\uc804 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 LDS-DL8.5\uc640 Top-k-DL8.5\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud45c\uc900 \ubd84\ub958 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 CA-DL8.5\uac00 LDS\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 consistently \uac00\uc7a5 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c anytime \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 CA-DL8.5 \ubcc0\ud615 \ubc0f Blossom \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CA-DL8.5\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc77c\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc740 NP-hard \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Traditional models often struggle to capture\nsemantic intent and complex behavior dynamics, while existing LLM-based\nsolutions face limitations in prompt adaptability and modality coverage. To\nbridge this gap, we propose DMFI, a dual-modality framework that integrates\nsemantic inference with behavior-aware fine-tuning. DMFI converts raw logs into\ntwo structured views: (1) a semantic view that processes content-rich artifacts\n(e.g., emails, https) using instruction-formatted prompts; and (2) a behavioral\nabstraction, constructed via a 4W-guided (When-Where-What-Which) transformation\nto encode contextual action sequences. Two LoRA-enhanced LLMs are fine-tuned\nindependently, and their outputs are fused via a lightweight MLP-based decision\nmodule. We further introduce DMFI-B, a discriminative adaptation strategy that\nseparates normal and abnormal behavior representations, improving robustness\nunder severe class imbalance. Experiments on CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets\ndemonstrate that DMFI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection\naccuracy. Our approach combines the semantic reasoning power of LLMs with\nstructured behavior modeling, offering a scalable and effective solution for\nreal-world insider threat detection.

Traditional modular approaches,\nwhile offering interpretability, suffer from error propagation and coordination\nissues, whereas end-to-end learning systems can simplify the design but face\ncomputational bottlenecks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous\ndriving using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that integrates bird's-eye view\n(BEV) perception for enhanced real-time decision-making. We introduce the\n\\texttt{Mamba-BEV} model, an efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction\nnetwork that combines BEV-based perception with the Mamba framework for\ntemporal feature modeling. This integration allows the system to encode vehicle\nsurroundings and road features in a unified coordinate system and accurately\nmodel long-range dependencies.

To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in\noptimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but\nalso decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional\npruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning\n(REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in\nperformance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might\nresult in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust\nability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly\nwhen trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are\nproposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate\nan optimal decision tree with better generalization. Our proposed approach\nassumes the pruning process as an exploration-exploitation problem, where we\nare utilizing the MAB algorithms to find optimal branch nodes to prune based on\nfeedback from each pruning actions. Experimental evaluation on several\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrated that our proposed approach results in better\npredictive performance compared to the traditional ones.

First,\nthe multi-source log preprocessing module aligns heterogeneous data through\nbehavioral sequence encoding, interval smoothing, and statistical feature\nextraction. Second, the Mamba encoder models long-range dependencies in\nbehavioral and interval sequences, and combines the sequence and statistical\ninformation dynamically in combination with the gated feature fusion mechanism.\nFinally, we propose an adaptive threshold optimization method based on\nmaximizing inter-class variance, which dynamically adjusts the decision\nthreshold by analyzing the probability distribution, effectively identifies\nanomalies, and alleviates class imbalance and concept drift.

However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat\nevent sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and\nmultiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that\ntransforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals,\nintroducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs\nMultivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract Intrinsic Mode\nFunctions (IMFs), which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal\nscales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral\nsequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are\nencoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies,\nwhile the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match\nthe encoder's output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused\nto construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a\nmultilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection.

Reward\nfunctions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual\nengineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically\naligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning\nthe current state with a target semantic instruction using a\nSentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT).\nInstead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives\nfeedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal\ntextual description and the statement description in the episode.

Brown"], "title": "SKATE, a Scalable Tournament Eval: Weaker LLMs differentiate between stronger ones using verifiable challenges", "comment": "7 pages and appendices", "summary": "Evaluating the capabilities and risks of foundation models is paramount, yet\ncurrent methods demand extensive domain expertise, hindering their scalability\nas these models rapidly evolve. We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation\nframework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and\nsolving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat\nevaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized\nto create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'\nweaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,\nopen-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and\nscalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable\ntasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited\nprogrammatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial\nreasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and\nscalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set\ncode-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible\nframework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking\nsystem, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can\nreliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are\ncapable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with\ntheir own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained\ncapability differences between models.

Achieving parameter-free optimal convergence rates for\nthese methods via Polyak--Ruppert averaging has remained elusive, largely due\nto the non-monotonicity of such semi-norms. We close this gap by (i.) recasting\nthe averaged error as a linear recursion involving a nonlinear perturbation,\nand (ii.) taming the nonlinearity by coupling the semi-norm's contraction with\nthe monotonicity of a suitably induced norm. Our main result yields the first\nparameter-free $\\tilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{t})$ optimal rates for $Q$-learning in both\naverage-reward and exponentially discounted settings, where $t$ denotes the\niteration index.

Additionally, we introduce a novel\ncharacterization framework for digital twins that aims to standardize and unify\ntheir application across different defence domains to facilitate\ninteroperability. Thereafter, we discuss the main challenges, gaps and\nlimitations in implementing and adopting digital twins within defence\norganizations by analyzing a combination of scientific literature, current\nindustry practices, governmental strategies, and the findings from a\ncomprehensive survey of industrial stakeholders and ministries of defense.\nFinally, we outline future research directions and development opportunities,\nemphasizing the need for robust frameworks and interdisciplinary collaborations\nto fully realize the potential of digital twins in the defence sector.",

However, excessively long reasoning traces introduce substantial\nchallenges in terms of training cost, inference latency, and deployment\nfeasibility. While various CoT compression approaches have emerged to address\nthis challenge, they face inherent trade-offs: token-level methods often\ndisrupt syntactic and logical coherence, while step-level methods based on\nperplexity fail to reliably capture the logically critical reasoning steps. In\nthis paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel\ncoarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided\npruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the\nsearch space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning\nby selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token\nsurprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and\nleverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in\ncoding tasks.

This study enhances the capability of\nLLMs to address contraindications effectively by implementing a Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as the base\nmodel, and the text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings, our approach\nintegrates Langchain to orchestrate a hybrid retrieval system with re-ranking.\nThis system leverages Drug Utilization Review (DUR) data from public databases,\nfocusing on contraindications for specific age groups, pregnancy, and\nconcomitant drug use. The dataset includes 300 question-answer pairs across\nthree categories, with baseline model accuracy ranging from 0.49 to 0.57.\nPost-integration of the RAG pipeline, we observed a significant improvement in\nmodel accuracy, achieving rates of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.89 for contraindications\nrelated to age groups, pregnancy, and concomitant drug use, respectively. The\nresults indicate that augmenting LLMs with a RAG framework can substantially\nreduce uncertainty in prescription and drug intake decisions by providing more\nprecise and reliable drug contraindication information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc81c\uc57d \uae08\uae30 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, RAG \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc81c\uc57d \uae08\uae30 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "OpenAI\uc758 GPT-4o-mini \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubcf8\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uace0, text-embedding-3-small \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, Langchain\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc7ac\uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 RAG \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "RAG \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud6c4, \uc5f0\ub839\ub300, \uc784\uc2e0 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc57d\ubb3c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uae08\uae30 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \uac01\uac01 0.94, 0.87 \ubc0f 0.89\ub85c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RAG \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c LLM\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ucc98\ubc29 \ubc0f \uc57d\ubb3c \ubcf5\uc6a9 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4 \ubd84\uc57c, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uae08\uae30 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \uae08\uae30 \uc0ac\ud56d \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.

Clinical\ninformation that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.\nShortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are\ncollected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU\nadmission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic\ndata (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as\ntwo phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel\nstepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of\nneurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of\ntime-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).\nNotably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying\nhemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this\ninformation is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient\nover time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our\napproach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two\nphases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear\nfeature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose\npost-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance\nfor the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,\nand death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two\nphases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic\nprediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly\ncollected features significantly improve prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2ec\uc815\uc9c0 \ud6c4 \ud63c\uc218\ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc608\ud6c4

Instead of relying on speculative\nbeliefs, it frames the asset's price within a Rational-Expectations\nSecurity-Utility Nash Equilibrium (RESUNE). This equilibrium is a fixed point\nwhere the market-clearing price dictates the hash rate through a free-entry\nmining model, which in turn endogenously sets the network's security. The\nsecurity, defined as one minus the probability of a 51% attack, is determined\nvia a global games model of attacker coordination, providing a unique and\ncontinuous security function. We prove the existence of a RESUNE and offer\nconditions for its uniqueness and stability. The model predicts that the\nstabilizing direct effect of price on demand must outweigh the potentially\ndestabilizing feedback from price to security. The framework generates testable\npredictions, such as a protocol halving causing a contraction in both hash rate\nand price. A structural Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is proposed to test\nthis mechanism. The model decomposes Bitcoin's value into transactional\nutility, security, and speculative components and explains the observed\nunidirectional causality from price to hash rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\ud2b8\ucf54\uc778\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc790\uc0b0\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\ud2b8\ucf54\uc778\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc790\uc0b0\uc758 \uac00\uaca9\uc744 \ud22c\uae30\uc801 \uc2e0\ub150\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "Rational-Expectations Security-Utility Nash Equilibrium (RESUNE)\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uc0b0\uc758 \uac00\uaca9\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ud574\uc2dc\uc728\uacfc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc720 \uc9c4\uc785 \ucc44\uad74 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9.", "result": "RESUNE\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\ub97c \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uace0\uc720\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uac00\uaca9\uc774 \uc218\uc694\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc548\uc815\ud654 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucee4\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uc608\uce21.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac00\uaca9\uc774 \ud574\uc2dc\uc728\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ub2e8\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc808\ubc18\uc774 \ud574\uc2dc\uc728\uacfc \uac00\uaca9 \ubaa8\ub450\uc758 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1\uc758 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\ud2b8\ucf54\uc778\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc790\uc0b0\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud22c\uae30\uc801 \uc2e0\ub150\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, \uc790\uc0b0\uc758 \uac00\uaca9\uc744 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uae30\ub300 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud6a8\uc6a9 \ub0b4\uc26c \uade0\ud615(Rational-Expectations Security-Utility Nash Equilibrium, RESUNE) \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc124\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uade0\ud615\uc810\uc740 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uccad\uc0b0 \uac00\uaca9\uc774 \uc790\uc720 \uc9c4\uc785 \ucc44\uad74 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uc2dc\uc728\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uc815\uc810\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 51% \uacf5\uaca9 \ud655\ub960\uc758 1-\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub418\uba70, \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uac8c\uc784 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub418\uc5b4 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud558\uace0 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.

This presents a significant challenge for\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for\nevaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack\nfine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs'\nlong-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux\nbenchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation\nand proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51\nreasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary\nline construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional\nevaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process\nquality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13\nleading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three\npivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in\nextended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop).\nSecond, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when\nsolving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and\nenhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry\nreasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for\nevaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a\nguide for capability advancement.

However, most existing studies focus on either\nheterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of\nheterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their\nperformance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in\nmodeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and\nmeta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of\nsemantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN\nemploys a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily\ndistributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages\nfrom diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which\nfilters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven\nreal-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of\nAHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(AHGNN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(HG)\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub2e8\uc77c \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AHGNN\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uba54\ud0c0 \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \ud649\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc77c\uacf1 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc640 20\uac1c \uae30\uc900\uc120 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c AHGNN\uc774 \ud2b9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uae30\ub41c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, AHGNN\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(HG)\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc885\uc885 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc5d0 \ub450\uc5b4 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 HG\uc758 \ub9cc\uc5f0\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb34\uc2dc\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 HG \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4: (1) \ud649\uacfc \uba54\ud0c0 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ubd84\ud3ec; (2) \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uba54\ud0c0 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub2e4 driven\ub418\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(AHGNN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Using Graph\nNeural Networks to detect these threats has become a research focus and has\ndemonstrated exceptional performance. However, the widespread adoption of\nGNN-based security models is limited by their inherent black-box nature, as\nthey fail to provide security analysts with any verifiable explanations for\nmodel predictions or any evidence regarding the model's judgment in relation to\nreal-world attacks. To address this challenge, we propose ProvX, an effective\nexplanation framework for exlaining GNN-based security models on provenance\ngraphs. ProvX introduces counterfactual explanation logic, seeking the minimal\nstructural subset within a graph predicted as malicious that, when perturbed,\ncan subvert the model's original prediction. We innovatively transform the\ndiscrete search problem of finding this critical subgraph into a continuous\noptimization task guided by a dual objective of prediction flipping and\ndistance minimization.

Lee", "Yeonhong Park"], "title": "DP-LLM: Runtime Model Adaptation with Dynamic Layer-wise Precision Assignment", "comment": null, "summary": "How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models\n(LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy?\nMulti-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient\nruntime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model\nvariants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question\nstill remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a\ntarget precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution,\nwe take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of\neach layer dynamically changes across decoding iterations. Building on this\ninsight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns\nprecision to each layer based on input values. DP-LLM augments each linear\nlayer in an LLM with a precision selector that determines the bitwidth at\nruntime using a lightweight error estimator and threshold values learned\nthrough fine-tuning.

However, current work focuses on user-oriented\nprivacy, overlooking severe enterprise data leakage risks exacerbated by the\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation paradigm. To address this gap, our paper\nintroduces a novel objective: enterprise-oriented privacy concerns. Achieving\nthis objective requires overcoming two fundamental challenges: existing methods\nsuch as data sanitization severely degrade model performance, and the field\nlacks public datasets for evaluation. We address these challenges with several\nsolutions. (1) To prevent performance degradation, we propose ABack, a\ntraining-free mechanism that leverages a Hidden State Model to pinpoint the\norigin of a leakage intention and rewrite the output safely. (2) To solve the\nlack of datasets, we construct PriGenQA, a new benchmark for enterprise privacy\nscenarios in healthcare and finance. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we move\nbeyond simple static attacks by developing a powerful adaptive attacker with\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization. Experiments show that against this superior\nadversary, ABack improves the overall privacy utility score by up to 15\\% over\nstrong baselines, avoiding the performance trade-offs of prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc5c5 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uae30\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ABack\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\ucd9c \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uace0 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc7ac\uc791\uc131\ud558\uba70, PriGenQA\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc5c5 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ABack\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc804\uccb4 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 15% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc720\ucd9c \ubc29\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc8fc\uc81c\ub85c \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, Retrieval-Augmented Generation \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc545\ud654\ub41c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uae30\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc815\uc81c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uacfc, \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacf5\uacf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We address this gap by\nproviding both the first non-vacuous, architecture-aware generalization bounds\nfor deep temporal models and a principled evaluation methodology.\n  For exponentially $\\beta$-mixing sequences, we derive bounds scaling as $\nO\\!\\Bigl(R\\,\\sqrt{\\tfrac{D\\,p\\,n\\,\\log N}{N}}\\Bigr), $ where $D$ is network\ndepth, $p$ kernel size, $n$ input dimension, and $R$ weight norm. Our\ndelayed-feedback blocking mechanism transforms dependent samples into\neffectively independent ones while discarding only $O(1/\\log N)$ of the data,\nyielding $\\sqrt{D}$ scaling instead of exponential, implying that doubling\ndepth requires approximately quadrupling the training data.\n  We also introduce a fair-comparison methodology that fixes the effective\nsample size to isolate the effect of temporal structure from information\ncontent. Under $N_{\\text{eff}}=2{,}000$, strongly dependent sequences\n($\\rho=0.8$) exhibit $\\approx76\\%$ smaller generalization gaps than weakly\ndependent ones ($\\rho=0.2$), challenging the intuition that dependence is\npurely detrimental.

The review discusses the strengths and limitations of different\napproaches, identifies which cyber threats are the most suited for\nsimulation-based investigations, and analyzes which modeling paradigms are most\nappropriate for specific cybersecurity challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84\ubcf4\uc548 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uc5ec \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84\ubcf4\uc548 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uba70 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc774 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc640 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uac01 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ub2e4\ub984\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uae30\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc120\uc815\ub41c \ub17c\ubb38\ub4e4\uc744 \uc751\uc6a9 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778, \ud45c\ud604\ub41c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611 \uc720\ud615, \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc95, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub77c\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\ud1a0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc801\ud569\ud55c\uc9c0 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84\ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131, \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \ub2e4\ub974\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uae30\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc95\uc774\ub098 \uc751\uc6a9 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4, \uc804\uccb4 \ubd84\uc57c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \uc120\uc815\ub41c \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \uc751\uc6a9 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778, \ud45c\ud604\ub41c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611 \uc720\ud615, \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc95, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub77c\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubd84\ub958\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uc0ac\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc801\ud569\ud55c\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

These attacks easily bypass existing\ndefenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To\naddress this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided\nCoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based\non two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to\ntriggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead\nof only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the\nagent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward\ncorrect answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to\nquantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers.\nCrucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content\nin phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM\nexcludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and\nsubsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer\n(QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average\nattack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy\non clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses.

Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be\nfleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a\nregulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having\n\"beliefs\" about its environment, which it \"updates\" in response to sensory\ninput. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more\nsophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more\nbroadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that\nthe observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere\nproperty of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds\nregardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic\ncontrol theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the\nmodel is of its environment either way.

However, the protection algorithms\nwould become ineffective when forgery attackers apply purification techniques\nto bypass the protection. To address this issue, we present a novel approach,\nAnti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within\nthe perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations,\nwhere the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the\nauthorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both\nprotection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain\nunder the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does\nnot disrupt the authorization perturbation.

To address these\nchallenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy\nby synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique\nwith a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from\nmultiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images.

Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based\nagents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal\nhuman intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost\nsavings.\n  In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions,\nshowing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security\ncost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to\nmislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the\ninfrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject\ntelemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior\nthrough a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system\nerror interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack\nmethodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing,\nand LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior\nknowledge of the target system.\n  To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that\nsanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal\nrole of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably\nblocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance.\n  Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system\ncompromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIOps\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ud601\uc2e0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubca1\ud130\ub85c\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AIOps\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud154\ub808\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud558\uc5ec AI \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc545\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c AIOpsShield\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AIOps \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf4\uc548\uc0c1\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud06c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uc778\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc758 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c AIOps \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc624\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ud154\ub808\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc870\uc791 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\ub2e4.

Empirical validation through Rapid Contextual Design\nmethodology with healthcare professionals demonstrates that users consistently\nprefer context-sensitive, multimodal explanations over technical transparency.\nOur findings reveal the practical urgency for AI systems designed for human\ncomprehension rather than algorithmic introspection, establishing a\ncomprehensive research agenda for advancing user-centered AI explanation\napproaches across diverse domains and cultural contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AI(XAI) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc124\uba85 AI\ub85c\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\ud68c\uae30\uc220\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uba85 AI \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc11c\uc0ac\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5, \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uac1c\uc778\ud654, \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \uacf5\uac1c \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc124\uba85 AI\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\uc9d3\ub294 8\ucc28\uc6d0 \uac1c\ub150 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc758\ub8cc \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640\uc758 Rapid Contextual Design \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc99d validation \uc218\ud589.", "result": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc5d0 \ub9de\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec\uc758 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc120\ud638\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uae34\uae09\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uc778\uac04 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\u6027\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc640 \ubb38\ud654\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec AI \uc124\uba85 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc758\uc81c\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AI(XAI) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \ube44\uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AI\ub97c \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc124\uba85 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ud22c\uba85\uc131 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Such a personalization approach typically improves\nmodel performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients,\nbut can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level\ndifferentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade\nthe utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due\nto the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following\nstandard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same\nclusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective\ntechnique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to\nmany federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise\nvia randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of\nclients assigned to each cluster.

Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a\nvaluable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and\nexploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine\nlearning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive\ncomponent to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the\ndecision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in\nthe legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal\ncases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies.\nSpecifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated\nlegal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the\nlegal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting\nfrom legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the\nsolutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and\nsemantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence\nagainst women.

In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols\nand develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and\nsimulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable\nto incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller\nprofitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we\nintroduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both\nNakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical\nperspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction\nconflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair\ndistribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use\nstate-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and\nconsider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about\nthe resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub098\uce74\ubaa8\ud1a0 \ud569\uc758\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\ud589 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc99d\uba85(Proof-of-Work) \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud22c\ud45c \uae30\ubc18 \ubc18\ud3c9\ud589 PoW \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub098\uce74\ubaa8\ud1a0 \ud569\uc758\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131, \uac70\ub798 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9 \ubc0f \ud655\uc778 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud3c9\ud589 Proof-of-Work \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uc874 \ud3c9\ud589 PoW \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \uacf5\uaca9 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c \ud6c4, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud22c\ud45c \uae30\ubc18 \ubc18\ud3c9\ud589 PoW \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\ud589 PoW \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ub098\uce74\ubaa8\ud1a0 \ud569\uc758\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 MDP \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uba70, \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubd84\uc11d \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud3c9\ud589 Proof-of-Work (PoW) \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ub098\uce74\ubaa8\ud1a0 \ud569\uc758\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ubcf4\uc7a5, \uac70\ub798 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9 \ubc0f \ud655\uc778 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\ud589 PoW \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uace0 \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\ub529\ub41c \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \uacf5\uaca9 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\ud589 PoW \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774 \ub098\uce74\ubaa8\ud1a0 \ud569\uc758\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub354 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc989, \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc218\uc775\uc131 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70 \uc0c1\ub300 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ub354 \ub192\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uad00\uc810(\ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc, \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9, \uac70\ub798 \ucda9\ub3cc, \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \ud638\ud658\uc131, \ud22c\ud45c\uc790\uc640 \ub9ac\ub354 \uac04\uc758 \uac70\ub798 \uc218\uc218\ub8cc\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ubd84\ubc30 \ub4f1)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\uce74\ubaa8\ud1a0 \ud569\uc758 \ubc0f \uae30\uc874 \ud3c9\ud589 PoW \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ud22c\ud45c \uae30\ubc18 \ubc18\ud3c9\ud589 PoW \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(MDP) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Often, the\ndefinitions of bias used in the literature are observational, i.e. they use the\ninput and output of a pre-trained algorithm to quantify a bias under concern.\nIn reality,these definitions are often conflicting in nature and can only be\ndeployed if either the ground truth is known or only in retrospect after\ndeploying the algorithm. Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to\nachieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an\nalternative dynamic mechanism,\"Fair Game\",to assure fairness in the predictions\nof an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with\nthe algorithm over time. \"Fair Game\" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing\nalgorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm. The \"Fair Game\" puts these two\ncomponents in a loop by leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL algorithms\ninteract with an environment to take decisions, which yields new observations\n(also known as data/feedback) from the environment and in turn, adapts future\ndecisions. RL is already used in algorithms with pre-fixed long-term fairness\ngoals. \"Fair Game\" provides a unique framework where the fairness goals can be\nadapted over time by only modifying the auditor and the different biases it\nquantifies. Thus,\"Fair Game\" aims to simulate the evolution of ethical and\nlegal frameworks in the society by creating an auditor which sends feedback to\na debiasing algorithm deployed around an ML system. This allows us to develop a\nflexible and adaptive-over-time framework to build Fair ML systems pre- and\npost-deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacf5\uc815 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774\ub780 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 AI \ubd84\uc57c\ub85c, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub290\ub07c\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "'Fair Game'\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uac10\uc0ac\uc790\uc640 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc81c\uac70 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc8fc\uc704\uc5d0\uc11c \ub8e8\ud504\ub85c \ubb36\ub294\ub2e4.", "result": "'Fair Game'\uc740 RL\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uc815 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\ub294 AI \ubd84\uc57c\uc778 \uacf5\uc815 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML)\uc740 ML \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5(\uacf5\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc54c\ub824\uc9d0)\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc758 \uc815\uc758\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uad00\ucc30\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc989, \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc785\ub825\uacfc \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\uc758\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ucda9\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc73c\uba70, \uc9c4\uc2e4\uc774 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uac70\ub098 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud55c \uc774\ud6c4\uc5d0\ub9cc \ud68c\uace0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uacf5\uc815 ML\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815 ML\uc774 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\ub294 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ML \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\ud68c\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc548 \ub3d9\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 '\uacf5\uc815 \uac8c\uc784'(Fair Game)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing\nFedRecs assume that all users have the same requirements for privacy\nprotection, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server. The approaches\noverlook the potential to enhance the recommendation service by utilizing\npublicly available user data. In real-world applications, users can choose to\nbe private or public. Private users' interaction data is not shared, while\npublic users' interaction data can be shared. Inspired by the issue, this paper\nproposes a novel Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy\nRecommendation (GFed-PP) that adapts to different privacy requirements while\nimproving recommendation performance. GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data\nof public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to\nform a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN)\nis employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To\nprotect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring\nfunction locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated\nrecommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on\nclients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server.\nExperimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms\nexisting methods for five datasets, offering superior recommendation accuracy\nwithout compromising privacy.

Existing membership inference methods commonly assume\nthat the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This\nassumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only\npartial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability\nof these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the\nadversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer\nwhether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target\nmodel. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI).\nTo address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and\nAnomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD\noptimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample.

However, a critical barrier\nis its training instability, where high-variance gradients can destabilize the\nlearning process. To address this, we draw inspiration from Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO), which uses a surrogate objective to enable stable sample\nreuse in the model-free setting. We first establish a connection between this\nsurrogate objective and RPG, which has been largely unexplored and is\nnon-trivial. Then, we bridge this gap by demonstrating that the\nreparameterization gradient of a PPO-like surrogate objective can be computed\nefficiently using backpropagation through time. Based on this key insight, we\npropose Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization (RPO), a stable and\nsample-efficient RPG-based method. RPO enables multiple epochs of stable sample\nreuse by optimizing a clipped surrogate objective tailored for RPG, while being\nfurther stabilized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and\nremaining fully compatible with existing variance reduction methods.

These\ninterventions can have positive or unintended negative consequences. Current\nresearch to model and determine an optimal intervention automatically through\nround-tripping is limited by the simulation objectives, scale (a few thousand\nindividuals), model types that are not suited for intervention studies, and the\nnumber of intervention strategies they can explore (discrete vs continuous). We\naddress these challenges using a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)\nbased policy optimization framework on a large-scale (100,000 individual)\nepidemiological agent-based simulation where we perform multi-objective\noptimization.

However, traditional Radio Resource\nManagement (RRM) techniques struggle with the increasing volume and complexity\nof data such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQI) from autonomous vehicles. To\naddress this, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Driven Resource\nManagement), an Edge AI-assisted framework that optimizes scheduling and\nfairness in vehicular infotainment. SCAR employs ML-based compression\ntechniques (e.g., clustering and RBF networks) to reduce CQI data size while\npreserving essential features. These compressed states are used to train\n6G-enabled Reinforcement Learning policies that maximize throughput while\nmeeting fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulations show that SCAR\nincreases time in feasible scheduling regions by 14\\% and reduces unfair\nscheduling time by 15\\% compared to RL baselines without CQI compression.\nFurthermore, Simulated Annealing with Stochastic Tunneling (SAST)-based\nclustering reduces CQI clustering distortion by 10\\%, confirming its\nefficiency. These results demonstrate SCAR's scalability and fairness benefits\nfor dynamic vehicular networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc624\ub77d \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubb34\uc120 \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc591\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc624\ub77d\uc758 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uacfc \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 Edge AI \ubcf4\uc870 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SCAR(\uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, prominent UCB-based approaches like CUCB suffer\nfrom additional regret factor $\\log T$ that is detrimental over long horizons,\nwhile adversarial methods such as EXP3.M and HYBRID impose significant\ncomputational overhead. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce the\nCombinatorial Minimax Optimal Strategy in the Stochastic setting (CMOSS). CMOSS\nis a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves an instance-independent\nregret of $O\\big( (\\log k)^2\\sqrt{kmT}\\big )$ under semi-bandit feedback, where\n$m$ is the number of arms and $k$ is the maximum cardinality of a feasible\naction. Crucially, this result eliminates the dependency on $\\log T$ and\nmatches the established $\\Omega\\big( \\sqrt{kmT}\\big)$ lower bound up to\n$O\\big((\\log k)^2\\big)$.

Even in the case where model weights are hidden behind a\nfine-tuning API, this gives attackers inadvertent access to a broadly\nmisaligned model in a way that can be hard to detect from the fine-tuning data\nalone. We present the first systematic study of in-training safeguards against\nEMA that are practical for providers who expose fine-tuning via an API.

Traditional multilingual\nmodels, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical\ndue to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual\nLearning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages\nsequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.\nThis paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the\nIndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,\ninitially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight\nadditional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We\nevaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:\nElastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning\nwithout Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,\nprivacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate\n(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as\nknowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of\nvarying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task. Results,\ncompared against naive fine-tuning, demonstrate CLs effectiveness in mitigating\nforgetting, making it a promising approach for scalable ASR in diverse Indian\nlanguages under realistic constraints.

A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic\ncomputing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired\nneural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data\nprocessing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs,\ndeep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep\nSSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal\nmodeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions\nand no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent\ndeep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that\ncombines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback\nmechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our\nproposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking\nfunction, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on\nvarious tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a\nsequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves\nperformance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature. Our\nresults illustrate how the proposed reset mechanism can overcome instability\nand enable learning even when the linear part of neuron dynamics is unstable,\nallowing us to go beyond the strictly enforced stability of linear dynamics in\nrecent deep SSM models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud615\ud0dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ub274\ub7f0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd \ud615\ud0dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc740 \uc800\uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ud638 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uae30\uc220\ub85c, \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc120\ud615 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378(SSM) \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud0b9 \ub274\ub7f0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 SNN \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub9ac\uc14b \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uae4a\uc740 SSM \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uacbd \ud615\ud0dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc740 \uc800\uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ud638 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ud765 \uae30\uc220\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uacbd \ud615\ud0dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud0b9 \ub274\ub7f4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(SNN)\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Submitted to Pattern Recognition", "summary": "Robust loss functions are crucial for training deep neural networks in the\npresence of label noise, yet existing approaches require extensive,\ndataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Fractional\nClassification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically\ncalibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the\nactive-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that\nthe fractional derivative order $\\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that\ninterpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.\nFurthermore, we integrate $\\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a\nlearnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off\nbetween robustness and convergence speed.

This modular architecture enables\ndisentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers\nalone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and\nbenchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard\ndisentanglement metrics.

In contrast, low\nexpressive data (LE), does not impact clustering outcome, is effectively\nbypassed, leading to considerable reductions in computational overhead.\nExperiments spanning synthetic, real-world and high-dimensional datasets,\ndemonstrate Gk-means is significantly better than traditional and state of the\nart (SOTA) k-means variants in runtime and distance computations (DC).\nMoreover, Gk-means exhibits better resource efficiency, as evidenced by its\nreduced energy footprint, placing it as more sustainable alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "Geometric-k-means (Gk-means)\uc740 k-\ud3c9\uade0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uacbd\uc81c\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "k-\ud3c9\uade0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Gk-means\ub294 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud569\uc131, \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc0f \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c Gk-means\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 k-\ud3c9\uade0 \ubcc0\ud615\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Gk-means\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uc904\uc5ec \ub354\uc6b1 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 k-\ud3c9\uade0(Gk-means)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc9c0\ub09c 50\ub144 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc628 k-\ud3c9\uade0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uacbd\uc81c\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.

The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately\nfabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a\nsignificant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive\nIntention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The\nsecond, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's\ninternal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we\nfind that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in\nparallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a\nmathematical model to explain this behavior.

However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing\nmolecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the\nsimultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular\ninteractions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the\nclassifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately\ntrained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance,\nenabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful\noff-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively\nhandles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation,\nfragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target\nspecificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety\nin molecular design.

Recent advances\nin large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation\naccuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is\npre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive\ndatabases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet\noverlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL\nframework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL\nqueries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit\ninformation from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We\nthen train a large db\\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based\nfinetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\\_id) based on\nboth the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules.

However,\nthese methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility\nto primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy\nquality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful\nplugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based\noptimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay\nnumber, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the\nrisk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a\nperiodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network\nplasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective,\ncombining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further\nbolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR\nsignificantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods\non both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative\nDPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging\nmath tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based\nalgorithms.

Finally, we\npropose new evaluation metrics tailored to the LLM setting and validate our\napproach on standard benchmarks such as TOFU, WMDP, and SafePKU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70\ub97c \uc704\ud55c GRIN\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc95\uc801 \ubc0f \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uac10\uc2dc\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud2b9\ud788 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubb34\ub2e8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GRIN\uc740 \uc78a\uc5b4\uc57c \ud560 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\uc5b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac00\uc7a5 \ucc45\uc784\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ube44\uc728 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc778 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc8fc\uc785\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3c9\uac00 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 TOFU, WMDP, SafePKU\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc95\uc801 \ubc0f \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uac10\uc2dc\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubb34\ub2e8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \uc78a\uae30\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc78a\uae30\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ud604\uc9c0\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uc78a\uae30\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \ubc0f \ud0c0\uac9f \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GRIN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
