Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts\nremain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for\nNeedle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by\nappending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to\nour method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an\nimportant role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench,\nshow that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across\nstate-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,\nand Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource,\ntransferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is\ncompute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can\noutperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These\nfindings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful\ngoal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "NINJA\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0dd\uc131 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud0c8\uc625\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc704\uce58\uac00 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae34 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "NINJA\ub294 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0dd\uc131 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud0c8\uc625\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "NINJA\ub294 LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemini \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2ec\uc9c0\uc5b4 \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \uae34 \ub9e5\ub77d\ub3c4 \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc704\uce58 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud604\ub300 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uae34 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc31\ub9cc \ud1a0\ud070 \uc785\ub825\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc838 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0dd\uc131 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ub82c\ub41c LM\uc744 \ud0c8\uc625\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 NINJA(Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack\uc758 \uc57d\uc5b4)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac83\uc740 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc704\uce58\uac00 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uad00\ucc30\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \uc548\uc804 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 HarmBench\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, NINJA\ub294 LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemini\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uacf5\uac1c \ubc0f \ub3c5\uc810 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ud0c8\uc625 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\uac00 \uc801\uace0 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ub35c \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 NINJA\uac00 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294\ub370, \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e5\ub77d \uae38\uc774\ub97c \ub298\ub9ac\uba74 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \ud0c8\uc625 \ub300\ube44 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud69f\uc218\ub97c \ub298\ub9ac\ub294 \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc2ec\uc9c0\uc5b4 \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc704\uce58 \uc124\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub41c \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \uae34 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc870\ucc28 \ud604\ub300 LM\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This\npaper presents a novel approach to help developers identify one-day\nvulnerabilities in forked repositories. Leveraging the global graph of public\ncode, as captured by the Software Heritage archive, the approach propagates\nvulnerability information at the commit level and performs automated impact\nanalysis. This enables automatic detection of forked projects that have not\nincorporated fixes, leaving them potentially vulnerable. Starting from 7162\nrepositories that, according to OSV, include vulnerable commits in their\ndevelopment histories, we identify 2.2 M forks, containing at least one\nvulnerable commit. Then we perform a strict filtering, allowing us to find 356\n___vulnerability, fork___ pairs impacting active and popular GitHub forks, we\nmanually evaluate 65 pairs, finding 3 high-severity vulnerabilities,\ndemonstrating the impact and applicability of this approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud3ec\ud06c\ub41c \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c 1\uc77c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc368\ub4dc\ud30c\ud2f0 \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ucef4\ud3ec\ub10c\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub798\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud5e4\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc9c0 \uc544\uce74\uc774\ube0c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uac1c \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ucee4\ubc0b \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc804\ud30c\ud558\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc601\ud5a5 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd1d 7162\uac1c\uc758 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c 2.2M\uac1c\uc758 \ud3ec\ud06c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774 \uc911 356\uac1c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131-\ud3ec\ud06c \uc30d\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc5ec 65\uac1c \ud3ec\ud06c \uc30d\uc744 \uc218\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc 3\uac1c\uc758 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c GitHub \ud3ec\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc11c\ub4dc\ud30c\ud2f0 \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc720\ub798\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ucd94\uc801\uc740 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c, \uc885\uc885 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud574\uacb0\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc740 \ud3ec\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud37c\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub41c \ud6c4 \ud328\uce58\ub420 \ub54c\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc720\uc9c0\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud3ec\ud06c \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ub3c4\uc785 \ubc0f \uc218\uc815\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucee4\ubc0b \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec, 1\uc77c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uac10\uc9c0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ud3ec\ud06c\ub41c \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c 1\uc77c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud5e4\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc9c0 \uc544\uce74\uc774\ube0c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ucea1\ucc98\ub41c \uacf5\uac1c \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucee4\ubc0b \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc804\ud30c\ud558\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc601\ud5a5 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\uc815 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud3ec\ud06c \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub0a8\uae34\ub2e4."}}

This paper investigates the complexities involved in resilience\ntesting against transferred adversarial attacks. Our analysis specifically\naddresses black-box evasion attacks, highlighting transfer-based attacks due to\ntheir practical significance and typically high transferability between neural\nnetwork models. We underline the computational infeasibility of exhaustively\nexploring high-dimensional input spaces to achieve complete test coverage. As a\nresult, comprehensive adversarial risk mapping is deemed impractical. To\nmitigate this limitation, we propose a targeted resilience testing framework\nthat employs surrogate models strategically selected based on Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA) similarity. By leveraging surrogate models exhibiting both high\nand low CKA similarities relative to the target model, the proposed approach\nseeks to optimize coverage of adversarial subspaces.

Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight,\ntreatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However,\nexisting methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer\narchitectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling\nto handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts.\nMoreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity\nincluding variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity,\nwhich is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE\n(Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD\nprogression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain\nchanges as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model.

However, existing\nbenchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately\nstress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in\nmany multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present\n\\textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment,\nCraftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general\nabilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \\textit{Craftax-MA} is\nexceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment\ninteractions completing in under an hour.

Traditional\nexpert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep\npace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic\nsystem for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nwith human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small\ncooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and\nfeedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools\nthrough the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise\noperation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with\nstep-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles\n(run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID\nimproves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring\nuncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).

Representation learning\nhas become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning\nlatent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring\nany supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely\nsuccessful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including\npredicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage\nbetween representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity\nin this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data\n(observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the\nsingle-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical\nand computational framework for causal structure and representation learning\nmotivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use\nobservational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed\ncausal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal\nvariables; and how to design optimal perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uacb0\uc815 \ub9c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uad00\ucc30 \ubc0f \uad50\ub780 \ub370\uc774\ud130, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubdf0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc778\uacfc \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uacfc \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uad50\ub780 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c \uc758\ud559\uc801 \uc9c8\ubb38 \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud65c\uc6a9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ub7c9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc8fc\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3d9\ub825\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc774\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uad50\ub780/\uac1c\uc785\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uacaa\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ud68c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc138\ud3ec \uc218\uc900, \uc870\uc9c1 \uc218\uc900 \ubc0f \uc720\uae30\uccb4 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30 \ubc0f \uad50\ub780, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc2dc\ud000\uc2f1 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc0dd\ubb3c \uc758\ud559 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub41c \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870 \ubc0f \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4: \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc778\uacfc \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad00\ucc30 \ubc0f \uad50\ub780 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95; \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubdf0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacfc \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95; \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uad50\ub780\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95."}}

This inherent assumption of data reliability creates a blind spot\nexploitable by Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where an adversary intercepts\nand alters intent before it is enacted, compelling the network to orchestrate\nmalicious configurations. This study proposes a secured IBN (sIBN) system with\ndata driven intrusion detection method designed to secure legitimate user\nintent from adversarial tampering. The proposed intent intrusion detection\nsystem uses a ML model applied for network behavioral anomaly detection to\nreveal temporal patterns of intent tampering. This is achieved by leveraging a\nset of original behavioral metrics and newly engineered time-aware features,\nwith the model's hyperparameters fine-tuned through the randomized search\ncross-validation (RSCV) technique.

Under these conditions, we explore the\npotential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines.

Under review", "summary": "Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and\ncomplex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to\na fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions.\nThis challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic\nmisunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats,\nand a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only\nrevealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and\ncomplementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging\nenvironment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online\ndistributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by\nlearning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output\ndistribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format.\nSecond, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven\nexploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal\ndynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world\nmodel. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,\nincluding function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the\neffectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal\ncomputational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective\nin complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle,\ndemonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based\nagents.

The next frontier is\nAI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,\nand evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and\nstakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,\nReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision\nachievable.\n  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for\nreasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers\n(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,\nGeneration, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a\nmulti-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions\nrequire explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying\nnormative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),\nand explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that\nstatistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with\nstatistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark\nevaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework\nshows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring\nsolution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over\ntrade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with\ncomputational reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\ub294 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc774\uba70, AI

Generative approaches promise\nfaster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,\nbut are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor\ngeneralisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from\nstructural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building\non this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion\nmodel that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within\nthe binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock\nexploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex\ndiffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show\nSigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates\n(RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8%\nreported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent\ngeneralisation to unseen proteins.

Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can\nbe deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating\nsystem-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the\nbenefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to\nall driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand\nwhether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed\nautonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective\nrationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral\neconomics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when\npursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of\nCR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed\nhuman-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained\namong driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a\nsimple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic\nagents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives.\nResults show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates\nthe robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the\nemergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based\non simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging\nadvanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective\ncooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy

We argue that requirements of effective coordination\nare twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present\nin offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However,\nprior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising\ndiffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally\nslow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling\nmulti-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a\nflow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into\ndecentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast\nexecution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and\n$34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and\ncomputational cost, specifically achieving about $\\boldsymbol{\\times14.5}$\nfaster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining\ngood performance.

While existing filtering and strategic\ndeployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook\nhow variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream\nmodel performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from\nadditional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts.\nThis interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different\nforecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a\nsystematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural\nnetworks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs),\nand time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under\nvarying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world\ntemperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are\neffective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate,\nleveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for\nlimited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies\nbut degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced.\nCrucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively\nlearning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights\nfor building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could\nsupport individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory,\nimaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated\npatients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with\nmetastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical\ncharacteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor\npositron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected.\nSeven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including\nunimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches.\nExplainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps.\nForty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1\nyear). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline\nchromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT\ncycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only\non laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal\nthree-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed\nworse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion\nmodel laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch\n- achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01).\nMultimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers\noutperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external\nvalidation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud3a9\ud0c0\uc774\ub4dc \uc218\uc6a9\uccb4 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc131

Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models\nallowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good\nstate coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of\nexploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting\nwhere the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment.\nTo capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we\nintroduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the\nmismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show\nthat if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We\npropose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear\nregret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We\nalso establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm\nachieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the\nnumber of interaction episodes.

Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally\nexpensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In\nthis study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach\nleveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically\nreduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP\npruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign\nhigher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher\nperforming sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although\nContrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing\npruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by\nContrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint\nrequired in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the\nsearch space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\\%.\nNext, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads,\nleading to a speed up of 59.63\\%-93.27\\% compared to Path Patching applied to\nthe dense model.

Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting,\ntheir efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data\nsources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across\ndifferent forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this\ncomplementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a\ncompelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In\nthis paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit\nspecialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how\nwe can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time\nseries models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and\nforecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration\nstrategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration\nframework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of\nTSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative,\ncontext-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by\nadaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other\npopular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating\nSynapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc911\uc7ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Synapse\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e8\uc77c TSFM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubc0f \uc218\ud3c9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud06c\uac8c \ubcc0\ub3d9\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c TSFM\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc911\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c TSFM\uc758 \uc804\ubb38 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc608\uce21 \uc218\ud3c9 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \uc911\uc7ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, Synapse\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uae30\ubc95\uacfc \uac1c\ubcc4 TSFM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Synapse\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc7ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(TSFMs)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacc4\uc808\uc131, \ud2b8\ub80c\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc8fc\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc784\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc740 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uac01 TSFM\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubc0f \uae30\uac04\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubcc0\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 TSFM \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc911\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \uc544\uc9c1 \ud06c\uac8c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 TSFM\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc804\ubb38 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \uc911\uc7ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ucca0\uc800\ud788 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc608\uce21 \uc218\ud3c9 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \uc911\uc7ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TSFM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc911\uc7ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Synapse\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
