Despite advances in machine learning and automation,\nconventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world\nexperiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This\ngap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,\nscalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.\nHere, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI\nthat unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated\nsystem for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,\nhumans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes\nmemory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The\nwearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture\nprocesses, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for\ncorrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we\npresent Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic\nreasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and\ninterprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,\nprovides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a\ncleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves\ncontext-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large\nlanguage models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to\nbeginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human\nintelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the\nphysical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into\nautonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uac04\uacfc AI\uac00 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 AI

This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance\npurchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs\nis evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they\nfall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this\nlimitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules\nincluding perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.\nThe retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground\ndecisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal\nand bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to\nextrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is\nintractable for traditional models.

However, the role of human-like memory within\nthese frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents\ncoordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where\niterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the\nsuccess. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present\nEvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The\nframework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor)\nand two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries\nby storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a\nquery, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by\naccumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement.

This\ngap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,\nshaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences\n(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory\nand leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric\nReasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.\nATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level\nsymbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it\nimplements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic\ntemplates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.\nValidated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA\nconsistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based\nmodels, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge\nmodels. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are\ncritical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall\npredictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling\nand semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling\nhuman-centric decisions.

This paper presents a novel traffic signal control\nframework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic\n(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model\nthe dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and\ntemporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a\nrobust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal\ncontrol through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the\nsystem to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with\nobjectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring\nsafety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs.

However, manual kernel design is\nboth costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage\nLLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,\nhowever, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational\noverhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose\nCudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and\noptimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human\nexperts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing\ncorrectness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More\nspecifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that\niteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating\nhardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive\nevaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,\nachieves 97.6\\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\\times$\nspeedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art\nmodels including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench.Beyond accuracy and speed,\nCudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,\n3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,\nQwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an\noptimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \\$\n0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that\ncosts 6 H100 hours and \\$ 5 API cost per kernel.

However, the full potential of such systems\nis hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies\nthat fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose\nSTRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in\nmulti-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and\nagent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable\nsingle agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.\nFurthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that\naccelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system\ntraining.

In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the\ndecomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to\nagents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited\nto the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned\nCooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for\nlearning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main\nchallenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove\nthe correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of\nlearned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.\nExperiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,\ne.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and\nshort-circuiting tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACC-MARL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud558\uc5d0 \uba40\ud2f0\ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c, \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub354 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc624\ud1a0\ub9c8\ud0c0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "ACC-MARL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ud300 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ACC-MARL\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud558\uc5d0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc784\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc624\ud1a0\ub9c8\ud0c0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ud560\ub2f9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud300 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(ACC-MARL)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ACC-MARL\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uae34\uae09\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \ubc84\ud2bc\uc744 \ub20c\ub7ec \ubb38\uc744 \uc5ec\ub294 \uac83, \ubb38\uc744 \uace0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83, \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub2e8\ub77d\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83 \ub4f1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Existing methods, such as offline or\ntransferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly\nmulti-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo\nexperiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,\ncollaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock\ntheir potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that\ntransfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a\nshared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation\nduring multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an\nMoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse\ncooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency\nand performance of backbone algorithms.

In this work, we used data on monoculture growth\ncapabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a\nnegative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the\nlargest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising\nover 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups\nco-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the\nwork of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We\nconstruct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage\nshared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to\npredict modes of interaction.

However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on\nsimplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These\napproaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but\noverlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,\nwhich are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human\nliterature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention \"keyword A\" and\n\"keyword B\" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.\nAdditionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using\nthe model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the\nscientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established\nresearch. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework\nto address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures\nkeyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven\nideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to\niteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A\ncritic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by\nproviding continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our\nexperiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by\n10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference\nacceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in\nscientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each\ncomponent in the workflow.

To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic\nevaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate\nlabels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing.

Applying our diagnostic\nlayer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with\nfoundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight\ninto whether failures

This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe\nlaterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.\nThe primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an\ninterpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity.

Despite\npromising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,\nin which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining\ncollaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this\npaper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior\nnaturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and\nefficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.\nFinally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost\nin multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter\nthis, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by\nallowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate\ninstructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary.

Previous approaches\nmostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly\ninto the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems\nlike molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each\ndata sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy\nlandscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution\naround the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data\nand the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives\nlike MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In\ncontrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with\ngradients that better align with valid configurations, while being\narchitecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions\nalso inherently respect physical symmetries.

To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical\ntask-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable\nsubgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled\nby an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the\ntree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent\nnodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent\nnode retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and\nshares environment-specific observations through working memory.

FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics\nwith disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving\nsample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM\nfirst learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from\npixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then\ndecomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical\npolicy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of\ninteractions, while a low level executes them.

Intensity-modulated\ncarbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but\nremains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading\nto laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many\ntreatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are\nlimited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)\nstruggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We\npropose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45\nTPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)\nQMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for\nstable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance\nefficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)\napply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to\nuniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed\npiecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker\nsystem interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and\naccelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10\ntesting), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans\ncomparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL\n$85.93\\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)\nimprovements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional\nTPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS\ninteraction, notably improving OAR sparing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec IMCT\uc5d0\uc11c 45\uac1c\uc758 \uce58\ub8cc \uacc4\ud68d \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc218\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \ube44\uad50 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub450\uac1c\uc548\uba74 \uc554 \uce58\ub8cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc7a5\uae30\ub4e4\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \uce58\ub8cc \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.

While\nthese static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to\nadapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the\nfirst adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on\nGeneralized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and\nexpressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety\nand liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations\nat runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically\nrepair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This\nensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and\nweakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and\nAtari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely\nsuboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped\nwith our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical\ncompliance compared with static shields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uba70, \ud658\uacbd \uac00\uc815 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 GR(1) \uaddc\uaca9\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc18\uc751\uc131 GR(1) \uaddc\uaca9 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, ILP(\uc720\ub3c4 \ub17c\ub9ac \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c GR(1) \uaddc\uaca9\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc815\uc801 \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubcf4\uc870 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud560 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc7a5\ucc29\ud55c RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc7a5\uce58\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uadfc\uc811 \ucd5c\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubcf4\ud638 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 RL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf4\ud638 \uc7a5\uce58\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uacf5\uc2dd \uc0ac\uc591 \uc900\uc218 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc0ac\uc591\uacfc \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\uc801 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc7a5\uce58\ub294 \uc815\uc0c1 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud658\uacbd \uac00\uc815\uc774 \uc704\ubc18\ub420 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc911 \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc18\uc751\uc131(rank 1)(GR(1)) \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, most existing approaches\nare developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability\nto generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major\nobstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts\nframework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes\nproblem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The\nmodel is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization\nstrategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and\nintra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task\nembeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's\ngeneralization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance\nwithin each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general\nintrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on\nthree domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five\ndiverse domains.

We demonstrate that this\nhuman-centered design reliably supports high accuracy classification (<50 ms\nlatency), offering a replicable framework to integrate dance-literate machines\ninto creative, educational, and live performance contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucc29\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c IMU \uc13c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc791 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb34\uc120 IMU \uc13c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04-\uae30\uacc4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\uace0, \ubb34\uc6a9\uac00\uc758 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc640 \uc5f0\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc548\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MiniRocket \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \ubc18\uc751\ud615 \uba40\ud2f0\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ubd84\ub958(<50 ms \uc9c0\uc5f0)\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ucda4\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4\ub97c \ucc3d\uc758\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad50\uc721\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c \uacf5\uc5f0 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucc29\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c IMU \uc13c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130, MiniRocket \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \ubc18\uc751\ud615 \uba40\ud2f0\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04-\uae30\uacc4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc791 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uccb4 \uae30\uc5b5\uacfc \uc5f0\uad00\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb34\uc6a9\uac00 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uac04-\uae30\uacc4 \ud611\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc758 \uae4a\uc740 \uad00\ucc30\uacfc \ubc18\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacf5\uc5f0 \ubcf8\uccb4\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \uae4a\uc774\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ubd84\ub958(<50 ms \uc9c0\uc5f0)\ub97c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ucda4\uc5d0 \uc815\ud1b5\ud55c \uae30\uacc4\ub97c \ucc3d\uc758\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad50\uc721\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c \uacf5\uc5f0 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The success of these systems will\ncritically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,\neven under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical\nstudies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a\ncollaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative\ncapabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable\nautomated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving\necological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and\nclosed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our\nresults reveal a \"collaboration gap\": models that perform well solo often\ndegrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break\ndown dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well\nalone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting\nwith the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a \"relay inference\"\napproach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,\nclosing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware\nevaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative\ncapabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent\nskills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \ubc1c\uc804\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac8c \ub420 \uac83\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7f0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc774\ub4e4 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\ud611\ub825\ud615 \ubbf8\ub85c \ud574\uacb0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\ub825 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uaca9\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ubb38\uc81c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud558\uba70 \uc790\ub3d9 \ucc44\uc810\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ucd9c\ub825 \ud615\uc2dd \uc81c\uc57d \uc5c6\uc774 \uc0dd\ud0dc\ud559\uc801 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "32\uac1c\uc758 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, '\ud611\ub825 \uaca9\ucc28'\uac00 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e8\ub3c5 \uc218\ud589\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud611\ub825 \uc2dc \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud611\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00, \ud611\ub825 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc2a4\ud0ac\uc744 \ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc815\ubcf4, \ud2b9\uad8c \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc758\uc874\ud560 \uac83\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uad00\uc2ec\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (i) \ud611\ub825 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uaca9\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, (ii) \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud558\uba70, (iii) \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \ucc44\uc810\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, (iv) \ucd9c\ub825 \ud615\uc2dd \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub450\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud611\ub825\ud615 \ubbf8\ub85c \ud574\uacb0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\ub3c5, \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801, \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ud398\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c 32\uac1c\uc758 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \uc624\ud508 \ubc0f \ud074\ub85c\uc988\ub4dc \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 '\ud611\ub825 \uaca9\ucc28'\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ub2e8\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc798 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud611\ub825\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ub54c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud611\ub825\uc774 \uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae68\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4;

(ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that\nmaintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes\nupdates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k\nguarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error.\nExperiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94),\ngraceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and\nprovably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG\nas a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "LUMA-RAG\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc778\ub371\uc2a4 \uc720\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04 \uac04 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ub358 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ube44\ub514\uc624, \uc624\ub514\uc624\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\ub371\uc2a4 \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4 \uc720\uc9c0\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc758\ubbf8 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "LUMA-RAG\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\uc0dd \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4: (i) \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc608\uc0b0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c HNSW \uacc4\uce35\uc758 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 IVFPQ \uacc4\uce35\uc73c\ub85c \uc3df\uc544\ub0b4\ub294 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d \ub2e4\uc911 \uacc4\uce35 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c;

This\nneglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust\ncost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate\nagents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the\ntravel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple\nsequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It\nalso supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and\ncost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to\nadapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on\nCostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently\nfail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5\nachieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance\nfurther dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions.

At the same\ntime, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior\nwork has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if\ninference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer\nsolutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we\nintroduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.\nWe demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads\ncan all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that\nhad been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter\n-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper\nintroduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked\ntogether with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and\nsemantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache\nlocality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can\nenable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we\ndemonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two\ndistinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be\noptimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called\nlost-in-the-middle problem.

We propose BRAINS (Biomedical\nRetrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address\nthis challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.\nBRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a\ncase-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on\ncognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain\nvolume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk.\nMeanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent\nrepresentations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base.\nThese auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer\nto enhance contextual understanding.

HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from\nclassical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for\ncomputer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO\nstill sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its\nblack-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches\nhave been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,\nthese approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization\nprocess. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated\ninterventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user\npreferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.\nTo this end, we generalize an existing method, $\\pi$BO, preserving theoretical\nguarantees.

Substantial progress has been\nmade towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such\nagents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing\ncoherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,\nan AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended\nobjective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of\nparallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before\nsynthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos\nuses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis\nagent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to\ncoherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively\nexecuting an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.\nKosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,\nensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of\nstatements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a\nsingle 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own\nresearch time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number\nof valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles\n(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that\nspan metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.\nThree discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or\nunpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four\nmake novel contributions to the scientific literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "Kosmos\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 AI \uacfc\ud559\uc790\ub85c, \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\uc0c9, \uac00\uc124 \uc0dd\uc131, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uacfc\ud559 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\uc0c9, \uac00\uc124 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Kosmos\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\uc0c9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 12\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \ubcd1\ub82c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Kosmos \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc758 79.4%\uc758 \uc9c4\uc220\uc774 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uba70, \ud611\ub825\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 6\uac1c\uc6d4\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uace0\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Kosmos\ub294 \ub300\uc0ac\uccb4\ud559, \uc7ac\ub8cc \uacfc\ud559, \uc2e0\uacbd \uacfc\ud559 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc720\uc804\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uacfc\ud559 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uacfc\ud559 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\uc0c9, \uac00\uc124 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However,\ntransformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention\nmodule (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which\nseverely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is\ncritical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under\nhigh request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.\n  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with\nlinear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent\ncomputation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we\nintroduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer\nattention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.\nThese models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained\nreasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing\nless critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.\n  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with\ndifferent SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as\nmore Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant\nof Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,\nachieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the\nproduction-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning\nperformance.

Under Review", "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but\nremain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with\nlarge aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate\ntext, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning\nsupport. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates\nexisting foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible\nmultimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user\nintent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their\noutputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,\naudio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex\ncross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of\nspecialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while\nmaintaining transparency and interpretability.

In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually\ntightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally\nmaster the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques\nin unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a\nsmoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on\nsimplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full\ndeployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a\nbinary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum\nstrategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes\nthe trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate\nthe effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large\nlanguage model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a\nmulti-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.\nThese results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the\nefficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory\nconstraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy\nenables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial\ninference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for\nresource-constrained deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774
