This work presents the\nfirst systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern\nagent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without\nsacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much\ncomplexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules\nyield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the\ndesign of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA\nbenchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework\ndesigns, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we\nquantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our\nfindings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework\nthat has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains\n96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while\nreducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%\nimprovement in cost-of-pass.

As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they\noften require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in\nspecialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce\ntraining costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT\ntechniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT\nmethods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized\napplications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify\nuncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically\nadapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We\npropose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel\nmethod that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines\nAdapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers\nof the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT\nenables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic\nfine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next\nround, enabling effective adaptation to new data.

However, the\nexisting planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their\nplanning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined\ntasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems\nfrom international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to\nformalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and\nchallenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered\naround the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target\nnumber from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss\nhow this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal\nbenchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows\nfor an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is\ncomputationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich\nenough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive\ntheoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and\ndemonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public\nbenchmarks.

Using a real-world connected\nvehicle 11 testbed with commercially available On-Board Units (OBUs), we\ndemonstrate that high-rate UDP flooding and oversized payload of BSM flooding\ncan severely degrade FCW performance. Results show that UDP flooding alone\nreduces packet delivery ratio by up to 87% and increases latency to over 400ms,\nwhile oversized BSM floods overload receiver processing resources, delaying or\ncompletely suppressing FCW alerts. When UDP and BSM attacks are executed\nsimultaneously, they cause near-total communication failure, preventing FCW\nwarnings entirely.

Unlike finite-horizon\nor discounted models, the average-reward criterion naturally captures long-term\nperformance for systems designed for continuous operation, where sustained\nreliability is paramount. We account for uncertainty in transition kernels,\nwith players aiming to optimize their worst-case average reward. We first\nestablish a connection between the multi-agent and single agent settings, and\nderive the solvability of the robust Bellman equation under the average-reward\nformulation. We then rigorously prove the existence of a robust Nash\nEquilibrium (NE), offering essential theoretical guarantees for system\nstability.

A central contribution of LMDG is Process Tree Labeling, a novel\nagent-based technique that traces all malicious activity back to its origin\nwith high precision.

However, existing\ntoken-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their\nirreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns\nduring decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both\nmarginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the\ncollective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal\ninformation over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted\ncompensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention\nmatching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in\nperceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller\nmodel's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger\nmodel. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and\nLongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV.

In\nthis paper, we present a fault detection method called : Recomputation with a\nModular Offset (REMO) for the logic blocks of the CT-BU using Montgomery\nReduction and another method called Memory Rule Checkers for the memory\ncomponents used within the NTT. The proposed fault detection framework sets a\nnew benchmark by achieving high efficiency with significant low implementation\ncost. It occupies only 16 slices and a single DSP block, with a power\nconsumption of just 3mW in Artix-7 FPGA. The REMO-based detection mechanism\nachieves a fault coverage of 87.2% to 100%, adaptable across various word\nsizes, fault bit counts, and fault injection modes. Similarly, the Memory Rule\nCheckers demonstrate robust performance, achieving 50.7% to 100% fault\ndetection depending on and the nature of injected faults.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacb0\ud568 \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \uc7ac\uacc4\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 FPGA\uc5d0 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec PQC \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790 \uc554\ud638 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uc591\uc790 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacb0\ud568\uc774\ub098 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc720\ucd9c\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "CT-BU\uc758 \ub17c\ub9ac \ube14\ub85d\uacfc NTT\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ucef4\ud3ec\ub10c\ud2b8\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c REMO\uc640 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uaddc\uce59 \uac80\uc0ac\uae30\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\ud568 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uacb0\ud568 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc740 16 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 1\uac1c\uc758 DSP \ube14\ub85d\uc744 \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, 3mW\uc758 \uc804\ub825 \uc18c\ube44\ub85c 87.2%\uc5d0\uc11c 100%\uc758 \uacb0\ud568 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uacb0\ud568 \uac10\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \uad6c\ud604 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c PQC \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad6c\ud604\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Despite recent\nadvances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures\nbased on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static\ndecomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion\nmechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To\nexplicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel\nDynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch\nDecomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale\nRouting MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in\ncomponent to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with\nexponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints\nthrough input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,\ninter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed\nrepresentations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a\nmulti-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained\nrepresentations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature\nextraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically\nfuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local\nexperts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for\nTSF tasks.

We first categorize backdoor triggers from a new\nperspective, i.e., their impact on the patched area, and divide them into:\nhigh-visibility triggers (HVT), semi-visibility triggers (SVT), and\nlow-visibility triggers (LVT). Based on this classification, we propose a\nprogressive defense framework, BDFirewall, that removes these triggers from the\nmost conspicuous to the most subtle, without requiring model access. First, for\nHVTs, which create the most significant local semantic distortions, we identify\nand eliminate them by detecting these salient differences. We then restore the\npatched area to mitigate the adverse impact of such removal process. The\nlocalized purification designed for HVTs is, however, ineffective against SVTs,\nwhich globally perturb benign features. We therefore model an SVT-poisoned\ninput as a mixture of a trigger and benign features, where we unconventionally\ntreat the benign features as \"noise\". This formulation allows us to reconstruct\nSVTs by applying a denoising process that removes these benign \"noise\"\nfeatures. The SVT-free input is then obtained by subtracting the reconstructed\ntrigger. Finally, to neutralize the nearly imperceptible but fragile LVTs, we\nintroduce lightweight noise to disrupt the trigger pattern and then apply DDPM\nto restore any collateral impact on clean features.

In response to growing interest in\nlocally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data\nconfidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to\nthoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in\nidentifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the\nContract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15\nopen-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary\nmodels outperform open-source models in both correctness and output\neffectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain\nspecific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,\nthough the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning\n(\"thinking\") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely\ndue to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate \"no\nrelated clause\" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are\npresent. This suggests \"laziness\" in thinking or low confidence in extracting\nrelevant content.

Unlike\nstandard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place\nlearnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.\nWhile they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in\nunsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a\ncomparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised\nfault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,\neach based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,\nFourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder\n(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating\ndata across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault\nDetection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest\noverall FDR ($\\geq$92\\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top\nperformer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.\nEfficientKAN-AE reaches $\\geq$90\\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating\nrobustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger\nscales ($\\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.\nThe OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to\nmatch top KAN-AE performance.

This phenomenon, known as\narbitrage, could enable sophisticated participants to exploit such\ninconsistencies.\n  In this paper, we conduct an empirical arbitrage analysis on Polymarket data\nto answer three key questions: (Q1) What conditions give rise to arbitrage (Q2)\nDoes arbitrage actually occur on Polymarket and (Q3) Has anyone exploited these\nopportunities. A major challenge in analyzing arbitrage between related markets\nlies in the scalability of comparisons across a large number of markets and\nconditions, with a naive analysis requiring $O(2^{n+m})$ comparisons. To\novercome this, we employ a heuristic-driven reduction strategy based on\ntimeliness, topical similarity, and combinatorial relationships, further\nvalidated by expert input.\n  Our study reveals two distinct forms of arbitrage on Polymarket: Market\nRebalancing Arbitrage, which occurs within a single market or condition, and\nCombinatorial Arbitrage, which spans across multiple markets. We use on-chain\nhistorical order book data to analyze when these types of arbitrage\nopportunities have existed, and when they have been executed by users.

However, existing\nmethods struggle to leverage the semantic complementarity across different\ntypes of flows for representing program behaviors, and their context-unaware\nnature further hinders the accuracy of cross-flow semantic integration. We\npropose and implement MalFlows, a novel technique that achieves context-aware\nfusion of heterogeneous flow semantics for Android malware detection. Our goal\nis to leverage complementary strengths of the three types of flow-related\ninformation for precise app profiling. We adopt a heterogeneous information\nnetwork (HIN) to model the rich semantics across these program flows. We\nfurther propose flow2vec, a context-aware HIN embedding technique that\ndistinguishes the semantics of HIN entities as needed based on contextual\nconstraints across different flows and learns accurate app representations\nthrough the joint use of multiple meta-paths. The representations are finally\nfed into a channel-attention-based deep neural network for malware\nclassification.

For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking\nhow neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one\nanother over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on\nfollowing the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate\nthrough the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings\ndemand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a\ntemporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution\nexplicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to\nencode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates\none node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)\nintra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)\ninter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To\nlearn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with\nparallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along\nintra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an\nentity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages\nafter every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin\nfraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,\nlifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\\% (vs. 74.1\\%) and raising Elliptic++\nillicit-class F1 to 88.1\\% (vs. 60.4\\%).

Existing approaches typically\nfollow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;\nsecond, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates\nfrom the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent\nstudies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow\nmodels with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the\nneed for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the\nform of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban\ndata exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from\nlanguage, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both\npretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,\na framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding\nprocess over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we\nintroduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s\nprediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic\nvalue. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban\nRepresentation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate\nfeatures by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.\nExtensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that\nour one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage\napproaches.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from\nthree primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This\nframework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and\nbiomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by\naggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques\nlike weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not\nonly improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the\nidentification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage\nover conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is\nparticularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of\nclinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially\naltering the course of the disease.

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not\ninterpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in\nneurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on\ndomain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on\ndomain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574, \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub354 \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud1b5\ud569 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd(\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589)\uacfc \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd(\ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ud574\uacb0\uc0ac\uac00 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589) \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc704 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub354 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 LLM\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub354 \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Such noise may cause models to lose attention on\nkey words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward\ndenoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the\nvalue model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value\nmodel is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and\nenabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric\nframework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two\ncore designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a\nfrozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These\nmechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture\nkey words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a\npassive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math\nreasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and\nmodel-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO\nbaselines.

However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently\nambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system\nbehaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data\ndependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and\nhandle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code\ngeneration framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal\nspecifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified\nModeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented\narchitectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating\ndecision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural\nrelationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously\neliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data\nflow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task.

The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new\nrelationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge\ngraph.

These models\nare typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral\ndrift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.\nHowever, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due\nto its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose\nSmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior\ndata to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen\nconsists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware\nSplit module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically\ncoherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose\nSemantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving\nrepresentative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,\nwe introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior\nrelationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the\nLLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core\nbehavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify\nand remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve\nthe factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.\nExperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen\nsignificantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior\nprediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by\n85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

However,\ntheir intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to\ninaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with\nhallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is\nparticularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or\nsource code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for\nInterpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors\nin interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact\nfunctional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural\nlanguage) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a\nsystem of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection\nframework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based\ncorrection.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual\ndata, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.\nTo address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM\nwith chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction.

We further examine its performance\nacross various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we\nfind that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier\nfor LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and\nimproves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug\ndevelopment, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and\nincorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework.

Then the model could focus on\nlearning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is\nalso the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,\ntext multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio\nclassification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show\nthat AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss\nof AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in\nvalidation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring\nabout 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while\nmaintaining classification effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "AS-Softmax\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\ub9e5\uc2a4\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0ae\uc740 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \ubc30\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud0c0\uac9f \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc640 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc790\ub97c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\uace0, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucd95\uc801 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\ub9e5\uc2a4\uc640 \uad50\ucc28 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0, \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud558\uac8c \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc18c\ubaa8\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud76c\uc18c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\ub9e5\uc2a4(AS-Softmax)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc810\uc218\uac00 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \ubc30\uc81c\ud558\uace0, \uc0d8\ud50c \ube44\uc728\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucd95\uc801 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 AS-Softmax\uac00 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\ub9e5\uc2a4\uc640 \uadf8 \ubcc0\ud615\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \uac80\uc99d \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ubc00\uc811\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucd95\uc801 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c 1.2\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AS-Softmax\ub294 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

This advancement is underpinned by the concept\nof Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training\ndata enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed\nbreakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and\nadvanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its\npotential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for\ndecision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by\nsystematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,\nand training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data\nefficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the\nrelationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we\ninvestigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,\nensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which\ncollectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational\nchallenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of\ndistributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary\ntraining on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these\nstrategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in\nadvancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future\nresearch.

However, it remains unclear whether the\nsuperior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their\nbase KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this\npaper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods\nand then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our\nresults show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of\nHKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods\nalter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.\nMoreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in\ncapturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate\nmain-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.\nTo further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE\nresearch, we propose the FormerGNN framework.

Previous research\nhas identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision\nand natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering\nperformance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,\nit remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular\ndata tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world\napplications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular\ndata, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks\nusing five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier\nfindings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,\nwhere improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for\ntraditionally privileged groups.

A\nmulti-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on\nsynthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.\nThe model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained\nwith backpropagation.

Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or\nsingle-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource\nwaste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning\nframework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on\nuser-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA\ncompliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent\ninitialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that\neliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,\nand (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization\npriorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a\nself-correcting system.

In\naddition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM\narchitecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain\ncomputation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,\nwith reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models\non two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world\ngeopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly\noutperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve\nlower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive\nmode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when\ncombined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient\nalternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between\nrecurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "MinConvLSTM\uacfc MinConvGRU\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ud569\uc131\uacf1 \uc21c\ud658\ub9dd\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uacfc \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c RNN\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 ConvRNN \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc778 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\uace0, \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "MinLSTM \ubc0f MinGRU\uc758 \ub85c\uadf8 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud504\ub9ac\ud53d\uc2a4 \ud569\uc0b0 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \ud569\uc131\uacf1 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, xLSTM \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc9c0\uc218 \uac8c\uc774\ud305 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569.", "result": "\ud6c8\ub828 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 ConvLSTM \ubc0f ConvGRU\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131.", "conclusion": "\ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc21c\ud658 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ud569\uc131\uacf1 \uc785\ub825 \uc9d1\ud569\ud654\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Homan"], "title": "Forest vs Tree: The $(N, K)$ Trade-off in Reproducible ML Evaluation", "comment": null, "summary": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the\nauthority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning\nevaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground\ntruth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,\namong whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has\nstudied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as\nis typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical\ndatasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated\ndistributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$\nconfiguration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation\ndata and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our\nfindings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N\n\\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested\non at least one metric.

These types of policies\nhave previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb\nconfiguration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these\npolicies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end\nfinetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in\npractical applications such as robotics because further data collection to\nperform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,\nwe investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient\nfinetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary\nto specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare\ndirectly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix\ntuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT\ntechniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the\nnumber of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models\nend-to-end from scratch.

Inverse reinforcement\nlearning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from\ndemonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice\npolicy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like\nautonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we\nneed not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal\nguarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability\nguarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically\nselecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce\nPAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets\nprobably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --\nproviding the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert\ndemonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the\napprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further\ndemonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the\nreward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,\nwe prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic\nmethods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\uc5d0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \ub9de\ucdb0\uc9c0\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc5ed\uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5(IRL)\uacfc \uc801\uadf9\uc801 IRL(PAC-EIG) \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uac04 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc624\ub958\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc2ec\uac01\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "PAC-EIG\ub77c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud68d\ub4dd \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc790\uccb4\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 Reward-EIG\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc720\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ub834 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ud65c\ub3d9\uc801 IRL\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}
