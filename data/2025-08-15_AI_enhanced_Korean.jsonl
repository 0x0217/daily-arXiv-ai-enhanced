The system is orchestrated via the Model Context\nProtocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.\nResults demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with\nan F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and\ntraditional approaches.

Recent DRAs have\ndemonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent\nresearch largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of\nthis work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).\nIn this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare\nODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),\ncomprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA\nbenchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems\non BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google.

In addition, the multi-operator\nshared micromobility system in a city complicates the problem because of their\nnon-cooperative self-interested pursuits. Existing regulatory frameworks of\nmulti-operator vehicle rebalancing generally assume the intrusive control of\nvehicle rebalancing of all the operators, which is not practical in the real\nworld. To address this limitation, we design REALISM, a regulatory framework\nfor coordinated scheduling in multi-operator shared micromobility services that\nincorporates the city regulator's regulations in the form of assigning a score\nto each operator according to the city goal achievements and operators'\nindividual contributions to achieving the city goal, measured by Shapley value.\nTo realize the fairness-aware score assignment, we measure the fairness of\nassigned scores and use them as one of the components to optimize the score\nassignment model. To optimize the whole framework, we develop an alternating\nprocedure to make operators and the city regulator interact with each other\nuntil convergence. We evaluate our framework based on real-world e-scooter\nusage data in Chicago. Our experiment results show that our method achieves a\nperformance gain of at least 39.93% in the equity of vehicle usage and 1.82% in\nthe average demand satisfaction of the whole city.", "AI":

Exploration is hindered by\none-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\napproaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution\nbottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative\nrefinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel\nAutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS\nmethods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage\nthat composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by\nintegrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle\nnotebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also\naddresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an\naccelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage\nmetrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline\nevaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,\nAIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,\nMLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in\nMLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results", "AI": {"tldr": "KompeteAI\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uacf5\uac04 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874 AutoML \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc LLM \uae30\ubc18 AutoML \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "KompeteAI\ub294 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 MCTS \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc0c1\uc704 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, Kaggle \ub178\ud2b8\ubd81\uacfc arXiv \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc124 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "KompeteAI\ub294 \uac1c\ubc1c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c 6.9\ubc30 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uba70, MLE-Bench\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 3\regexp{}\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Kompete-bench\ub97c \uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec MLE-Bench\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c KompeteAI\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 AutoML \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub41c \uc6d0\uc0f7 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc7ac\uc870\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubaac\ud14c\uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9(MCTS) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubc29\ud574\ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud589 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uae34 \ucf54\ub4dc \uac80\uc99d \uc8fc\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uacf5\uac04 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 AutoML \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 KompeteAI\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive\nlanguage models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity\ngeneration remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or\ntightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose\nMAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that\nunifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:\nCognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration\nwithin a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three\nrole-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -\nengage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and\nplanning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism\nthat orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a\nmutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,\nscalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without\nthe need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including\nimage, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction\nfollowing, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and\nstate-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the\npowerful closed-source model GPT-4o.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAGUS\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ubc0f \ube44\ub514\uc624\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec \uac04\uc758 \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 any-to-any \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MAGUS\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0(Cognition) \ubc0f \uc2ec\uc758(Deliberation)\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(Perceiver, Planner, Reflector)\uac00 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud654\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2ec\uc758 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uc0c1\ud638 \uac15\ud654\ub418\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc728\ub418\ub294 Growth-Aware Search \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, MAGUS\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, MME \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MAGUS\uac00 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud3d0\uc1c4 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 GPT-4o\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MAGUS\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131, \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubcc0\ud658 \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ubc0f \ube44\ub514\uc624\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec \uac04\uc758 \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 any-to-any \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc885\uc885 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc774\ub098 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0(Cognition) \ubc0f \uc2ec\uc758(Deliberation)\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MAGUS(\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\ub0b4 \ud1b5\ud569 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

FL offers formal security guarantees when\ncombined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,\nhowever, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical\nutility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often\npresent in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these\ninterconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL\nframework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial\nexperiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,\nresulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first\nintegrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek\nLinks (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically\nuseful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using\na tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear\ntrade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the\noptimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal\noperational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong\nprivacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high\nclinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a\npractical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate\ndiagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare\ndata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud658\uc790 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2ec\ud608\uad00 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc SMOTETomek \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c FedProx \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc9c4\ub8cc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uacfc \uc0ac\uc0dd\ud65c \ubcf4\ud638 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud569\uc131 \uc18c\uc218\uc790 \uacfc\ud45c\uc9d1 \uae30\ubc95(SMOTETomek)\uc744 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc870\uc815\ub41c FedProx \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uc885 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc608\uc0b0(\uc5e1\uc2e4\ub860)\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc7ac\ud604\ub960 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc801 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c FedProx\uac00 \ud45c\uc900 FedAvg\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568\uc744 revealed \ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uba70 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uccad\uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5 \uac74\uac15 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive\ncomputation on simple problems and reducing efficiency.

In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify\nthat encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to\nits solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise\nreward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of\nintermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and\nnaturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and\nAIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our\nmethod achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original\nreasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and\naccuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before\nand after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively\nsuppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally\nalleviating the overthinking problem.

We evaluate the effectiveness of our\nmodel in defending against jailbreak attacks through comparative analysis,\ncomparing our approach with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against six\ndifferent attacks and assessing the helpfulness of LLMs under these defenses.\nOur model demonstrates its ability to reduce the Attack Success Rates of\njailbreak attacks by up to 88% while maintaining the original LLMs'\nperformance, achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.\nNotably, our model is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to all LLMs,\nincluding both white-box and black-box models, to enhance their safety without\nrequiring any fine-tuning of the models themselves. We will make our model\npublicly available for research purposes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Large Language Models(LLMs)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubc29\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Context Filtering \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLMs\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c jailbreak \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Context Filtering \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uac78\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 jailbreak \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 88%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc6d0\ub798 LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ubc15\uc2a4\uc640 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900 \ubc18\uba74, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubc0f \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 LLM\uc744 \uc18d\uc774\uace0 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace4 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uace0 \ubd88\uc2e0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uac78\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc545\uc758\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc785\ub825 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Context Filtering \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We present\nCCS-7 (Cognitive Cybersecurity Suite), a taxonomy of seven vulnerabilities\ngrounded in human cognitive security research. To establish a human benchmark,\nwe ran a randomized controlled trial with 151 participants: a \"Think First,\nVerify Always\" (TFVA) lesson improved cognitive security by +7.9% overall. We\nthen evaluated TFVA-style guardrails across 12,180 experiments on seven diverse\nlanguage model architectures.

Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region\nPolicy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each\nagent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,\nespecially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose\ntwo approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:\nHATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes\nthreshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy\nalgorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By\nconnecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold\nscheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in\nheterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods\nsignificantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and\nhigher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and\nHATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding\n22.5%.

Owing to the comparatively less\nstringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view\nthem as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns,\nwhich can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These\nattacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors\nto manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms,\nthereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and\nutility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based\nframework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential\nenergy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial\nNeural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy\nconsumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack\ntypes, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and\nsigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A\nsynthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household\nbehaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are\neffective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution\nfor enhancing grid resilience at the edge.

Existing benchmarks, often static or focused\non social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this\nreasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research\nframework based on the classic \"Turtle Soup\" game, integrating a benchmark, an\nagent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first\nlarge-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,\ncomprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert\nauthors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'\nperformance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a\nmulti-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,\nand conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability\nlimits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to\nhumans.

Static malware analysis, which does not require software execution,\nrelies increasingly on machine learning techniques to achieve scalability.\nAlthough such techniques obtain very high detection accuracy, they can be\neasily evaded with adversarial examples where a few modifications of the sample\ncan dupe the detector without modifying the behavior of the software. Unlike\nother domains, such as computer vision, creating an adversarial example of\nmalware without altering its functionality requires specific transformations.\nWe propose a new model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection by\ndesign.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by\nusing a \\textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a\n\\textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without\nmimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for\ntraining, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and\nallowing attacks across various tasks.\n  CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text\nclassification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks\nsubstitute models.\n  In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six\ntasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image\ngeneration--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100\nqueries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google\nTranslate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation\nmodels (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and\neffectiveness in real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "CEMA\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc801\ub300 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc801\ub300 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucffc\ub9ac\uc640 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\ub9cc \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0 \ub35c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "CEMA\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04\uc758 \uc801\ub300 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CEMA\ub294 100\uac1c\uc758 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub85c\ub3c4 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 API\uc640 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CEMA\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc801\ub300 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uacf5\uc720 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uacfc \uc218\ub9ce\uc740 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ud55c\uc815\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 API, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucffc\ub9ac \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\ud615\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub35c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \textbf{C}luster\uc640 \textbf{E}nsemble \textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack(\textbf{CEMA})\ub77c\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However,\nreal-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of\nrarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully\ncapture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on\nlongitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical\nperformance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,\nlargely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address\nthese issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for\nRobust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two\ncomplementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated\nmedical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from\nreal-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which\nnaturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer\nthrough shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.\nTo further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse\nregularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing\nspurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model\nachieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and\nmaintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive\nexperiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience\nto unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned\nsparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc758\ub8cc \uae30\ub85d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d\ubb3c \ucd94\ucc9c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uacb0\ud568\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub300\uc751\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85.

It ensures\nprivacy for clients, but is susceptible to data poisoning attacks during\ntraining that degrade model performance and integrity. Current poisoning\ndetection methods in federated learning lack a standardized detection method or\ntake significant liberties with trust. In this paper, we present \\Sys, a novel\nblockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning.

(2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a\ndataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual\nexpansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and\ngenerate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a\nchallenging dataset for robust training.

In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the\nseven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose,\nevaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent\nsystem was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry\nin WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and\nanomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as\nfollows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service,\nand (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained\nby the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance\ndegradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were\nincreased, as a result of poor system adaptations.

Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used\nto translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,\nthese LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited\nexposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two\nmain types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural\ninconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)\nsemantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the\nqueries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose\nFIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core\ncomponent, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the\nSciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,\none-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance\nwith baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using\nBLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact\nmatch(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,\nSPARQL queries, and the results of the queries.

A\ncomprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to\nsystematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data\nprocessing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS\ndatabase manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption\naccording to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges\nthe interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various\nphases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then,\ngenerative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are\nproposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios.\nFurther, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which\nleverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules\nconsidering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial\nreasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual\nindicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and\ndetect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on\nthe IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios,\nwhile visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach\ncombines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic\nrules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(EMS)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uba40\ud2f0 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uacf5\uaca9/\uc624\ub958 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc0dd\uc131 AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "IEEE 14-Bus \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\uac01 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc218\uce58 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud328\ud134 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(EMS)\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubb38\uc81c(SP)\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd08\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 EMS \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uacf5\uaca9/\uc624\ub958 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4(RTDB) \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\uc815(SE) \uc2a4\ud154\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9, EMS \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \uc870\uc791 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04-\uae30\uacc4 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(HMI) \ud45c\uc2dc \uc190\uc0c1\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 SCADA \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud750\ub984\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\ub300 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubca1\ud130\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5b4\uc11c, \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub825 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c EMS\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 AI(GenAI) \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(ADS)\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc0dd\uc131 AI \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub9c8\ud06c \uc9d1\ud569 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc9c0\ub2a5(SoM-GI) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best\npractice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still\nprimarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very\nrecently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art\nmethods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and\nfeature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that\ncombines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt\nto the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts\nof training data.\n  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced\ntabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance\nacross $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across\n$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides\ninterpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.", "AI": {"tldr": "xRFM\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uace0 \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5 \ud559\uc2b5 \ucee4\ub110 \uae30\uacc4\uc640 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c, $31$\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud45c \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc774\uba70, \uc774 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc120\uc758 \uc2e4\ucc9c\uc740 \uac70\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc5c6\ub2e4.", "method": "xRFM\uc740 \uae30\ub2a5 \ud559\uc2b5 \ucee4\ub110 \uae30\uacc4\uc640 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "xRFM\uc740 $100$\uac1c\uc758 \ud68c\uadc0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, $200$\uac1c\uc758 \ubd84\ub958 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 GBDTs\ub97c \ub2a5\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "xRFM\uc740 Average Gradient Outer Product\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf8\ub798 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud45c \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 AI\uc758 \ub098\uba38\uc9c0 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3ed\ubc1c\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640\ub294 \ub300\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc120\uc758 \uc2e4\ucc9c\uc740 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc8fc\ub85c Gradient Boosted Decision Trees(GBDTs)\uc758 \ubcc0\ud615\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubc0f \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uace0 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb34\uc81c\ud55c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uae30\ub2a5 \ud559\uc2b5 \ucee4\ub110 \uae30\uacc4\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 xRFM\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \ub3c4\uc785\ub41c \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378(TabPFNv2)\uacfc GBDTs\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud574 $31$\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c, xRFM\uc774 $100$\uac1c\uc758 \ud68c\uadc0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, $200$\uac1c\uc758 \ubd84\ub958 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 GBDTs\ub97c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c xRFM\uc740 Average Gradient Outer Product\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf8\ub798\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The framework consists of two layers:\nautonomous micro-agents at each node perform local traffic analysis and anomaly\ndetection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect\ncoordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We\nevaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations.\nResults confirm that the two-tier agentic-AI design scales under resource\nconstraints, reduces redundancy, and improves response time without\ncompromising accuracy.

Mobile\nhealth (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive\nInterventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized\nphysical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such\ninterventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents\nmethodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm\nrandomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,\ninformed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and\ntiming of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.\n  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,\nrandom, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms\nreceived nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science\nprinciples. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm\nreceived nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA\nbarriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We\nincluded 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,\nbaseline steps 5,618.2).\n  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups\nfrom baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased\naverage daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296\nsteps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,\np=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared\nto the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation\nmodels also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.\ncontrol (+208 steps, p=0.002).

While\nartificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is\ntransforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to\nphysicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific\nmedical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the\nability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous\ncomplaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's\nability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.\nTo address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship\nbetween physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with\nphysicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM\nendowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the\nfull-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement.

However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to\nadjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level\nadjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we\npropose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU\nby strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we\nestablish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of\nspecified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first\nexamine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively\ngeneralizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an\nunlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance\nunlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO)\nframework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to\nminimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is\ntrained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that\nWater4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image\ngeneration tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU\nscenarios, known as \"challenging forgets\".", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ubd88\ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0ad\uc81c \uad8c\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ubd88\ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ubd88\ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Water4MU\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ubd88\ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubd88\ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ad\uc81c \uad8c\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ubd88\ud559\uc2b5(MU)\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(ML) \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc640 \uaddc\uc81c \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uc558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 MU \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc911 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc900 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ubd88\ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uac00\uc838\uc62c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 MU\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ubd88\ud559\uc2b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ubd80\ucc29\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 MU\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\uace0, MU\uac00 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ubd80\ucc29\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub428\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd88\ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Water4MU\ub77c\ub294 \ubd88\ud559\uc2b5 \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc778 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

We study model-induced stochasticity, which\nquantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when\nthe set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.\n  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast\naccuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time\nseries forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and\naccuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,\nTemporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on\npublic data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show\nthat ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or\neven improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,\nthe main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of\nforecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.",

We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the\nfirst multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest\nX-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a\nmulti-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable\nprobabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical\ndata, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic\nsupernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet\nlayer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and\ndirectly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient\nfindings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding\nwhether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To\noptimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel\nthree-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive\npath-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous\nevaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,\nsafety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning.

Managing such identities through\ncentralized providers can cause both availability and privacy concerns: single\npoints of failure and control are ideal targets for global attacks on\ntechnical, organizational, or legal fronts. We design, analyze, and build a\ndistributed digital identity architecture for physical world transactions in\ncommon scenarios like unlocking doors, public transport, or crossing country\nborders. This architecture combines (biometric and other) sensors, (established\nand upcoming) identity authorities, attribute verifiers, and a new core\ncomponent we call the \\emph{Personal Identity Agent (PIA)} that represents\nindividuals with their identity attributes in the digital domain. All\ntransactions are conducted in a completely decentralized manner, and the\ncomponents for which we currently assume central coordination are optional and\nonly used for assisting with service discovery and latency reduction.

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then\nreduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the\ntarget language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient\nalgorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various\napplications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in\nJSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness\nwhile consistently preserving or improving functional correctness.

The problem is typically framed as optimizing an\nLM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.\nRecently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment\nmethod that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and\nfurther improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference\ncandidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.\nHowever, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic\neffectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference\ncandidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\\times$ effectiveness\ncompared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\\times$ effectiveness for\nZephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,\nwhich divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference\ninjection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference\nfine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and\nempirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective\nalgorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5\nmodels (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,\nSLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and\nboundary measurement.", "AI": {"tldr": "LM\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638 \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.

However,\ntransmitting raw sensor data to a central server for training deep learning\nmodels introduces significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive\nmine-specific information. Federated Learning (FL) offers a transformative\nsolution by enabling collaborative model training while ensuring that raw data\nremains localized at each mine. Despite its advantages, FL in underground\nmining faces key challenges: (i) An attacker may compromise a mine's local\nmodel by employing techniques such as sign-flipping attacks or additive noise,\nleading to erroneous predictions; (ii) Low-quality (yet potentially valuable)\ndata, caused by poor lighting conditions or sensor inaccuracies in mines may\ndegrade the FL training process. In response, this paper proposes MineDetect, a\ndefense FL framework that detects and isolates the attacked models while\nmitigating the impact of mines with low-quality data. MineDetect introduces two\nkey innovations: (i) Detecting attacked models (maliciously manipulated) by\ndeveloping a history-aware mechanism that leverages local and global averages\nof gradient updates; (ii) Identifying and eliminating adversarial influences\nfrom unreliable models (generated by clients with poor data quality) on the FL\ntraining process. Comprehensive simulations across diverse datasets demonstrate\nthat MineDetect outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy,\neven in challenging non-IID data scenarios.

However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex\ndomains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process\nverifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading\nto a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.\nNevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in\ntheir training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo\n(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we\nidentify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather\nthan bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator\n(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \\textsc{Com}pound \\textsc{M}onte\n\\textsc{C}arlo \\textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased\nestimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and\nsubsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable\nreduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without\nadditional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the\nMATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nNotably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,\nthe non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32\nsampling experiment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub86d\uace0 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc218\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "ComMCS\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud604\uc7ac \ubc0f \uc774\ud6c4 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 MC \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc120\ud615 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ComMCS\uac00 MATH-500\uc758 Best-of-32 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\uadc0 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 2.8\uc810, \ube44\ubd84\uc0b0 \uac10\uc18c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 2.2\uc810\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 LLM \ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc218\ud559\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd80\ubd84 \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uc778\uc774 \uc815\ub2f5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uac80\uc99d\uae30\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaac\ud14c\uce74\ub97c\ub85c(MC) \uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc758 \ucd94\uc815 \uc624\ub958\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uc800\ud574\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd94\uc815 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud3b8\ud5a5\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uace0 MC \ucd94\uc815\uc790\uac00 \ucd5c\uc18c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubd88\ud3b8 \ucd94\uc815\uae30(MVUE)\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud604\uc7ac \ubc0f \uc774\ud6c4 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 MC \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc120\ud615 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte \textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling(ComMCS) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 LLM \ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uac00\uc838\uc628\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 MATH-500 \ubc0f GSM8K \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, ComMCS\ub294 MATH-500\uc5d0\uc11c Best-of-32 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc911 \ud68c\uadc0 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 2.8\uc810, \ube44\ubd84\uc0b0 \uac10\uc18c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 2.2\uc810 \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\nmade it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new\nopportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly\ntranslating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly\nchallenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and\nnumerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework\nfor CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with\ngoal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific\nrewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external\nevaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and\nhigh-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization\nstrategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss\nfor enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce\nnoisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a\nnoval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural\nlanguage and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery\nscripts, and rendered 3D models.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel\nframework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation\nfine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal\nsubspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's\nrepresentation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition\nstrategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering\ndirections with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic\nweighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise\ncontrol. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism\nthat dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant\ntokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show\nthat MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods\nacross a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream\ntasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Multi-Subspace Representation Steering(MSRS)\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uac01 \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uad50\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc704 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uc5ec \uc18d\uc131 \uac04 \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \ub54c \uac04\uc12d \ubc0f \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc808\ucda9\uc810\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MSRS\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uacf5\uac04 \ud45c\ud604 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud558\uc704 \uacf5\uac04 \uc870\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc MSRS\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131 \uac04 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc55e\uc9c0\ub974\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud6c4\uc18d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MSRS\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc815\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc870\uc815\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc870\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc5b4 \uc885\uc885 \uac04\uc12d\uacfc \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc808\ucda9\uc810\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \ud45c\ud604 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc18d\uc131 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \ud45c\ud604 \uc870\uc815(MSRS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this paper,\nwe examine these claims and find that they arise from fundamental modeling\nflaws. Most critically, the authors' simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed\nto initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE,\ncausing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic\nsequence of cache lines.

However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep\nsemantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the\nefficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into\ndialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional\napproaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,\nwhich often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in\nrecommendations that may not align with user expectations.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender\ncentered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided\ncontext-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its\nheart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with\nknowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving\nfine-grained semantic mismatches.

Our analysis\nindicates that a significant portion of the approaches applied in this domain\nfail to sufficiently meet the stringent requirements of systems processing\ntransactions at rates of multi-million TPS. AlDBaran signifies a substantial\nadvancement in authenticated databases. By eliminating disk I/O operations from\nthe critical path, implementing prefetching strategies, and refining the update\nmechanism of the Merkle tree, we have engineered an authenticated data\nstructure capable of handling state updates efficiently at a network throughput\nof 50 Gbps. This throughput capacity significantly surpasses any empirically\ndocumented blockchain throughput, guaranteeing the ability of even the most\nhigh-throughput blockchains to generate state commitments effectively.\n  AlDBaran provides support for historical state proofs, which facilitates a\nwide array of novel applications. For instance, the deployment of AlDBaran\ncould enable blockchains that do not currently support state commitments to\noffer functionalities for light clients and/or implement rollups.\n  When benchmarked against alternative authenticated data structure projects,\nAlDBaran exhibits superior performance and simplicity. In particular, AlDBaran\nachieves speeds of approximately 48 million updates per second using an\nidentical machine configuration. This characteristic renders AlDBaran an\nattractive solution for resource-limited environments, as its historical data\ncapabilities can be modularly isolated (and deactivated), which further\nenhances performance.

Self- and semi-supervised learning\nmethods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when\nfinetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained\nfrom scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic\nand their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we\npropose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent\nrepresentations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in\noptimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight\nframe-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few\nlabeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while\nenforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with\nour method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show\nthat our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied\nto LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time\nseries classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning\npre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35

A persisting challenge\nis model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more\nmixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we\ndevelop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for\noverspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown\n$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the\npopulation level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we\nestablish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$\nsteps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe\nsublinear convergence in $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the\n$\\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample\nlevel, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we\ndemonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with\nsufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$\ngiven $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our\npopulation level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final\naccuracy $\\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the\nfinite-sample level, namely letting $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for\nsufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$\nfor sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration\ncomplexity bounds $O(\\log (1/\\epsilon))=O(\\log (n/d))$ and\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently\nunbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights.

However, existing approaches typically\nrepresent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial\nexplosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,\nespecially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation\nresults in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory\nrequirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale\nproblems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN\nrepresentation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and\nexplicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our\napproach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid\nworld, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger\ngrid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and\nsubstantially improves policy generalization and success rates.

However, recent studies have shown that\nthese systems are vulnerable to graph manipulation attacks, where attackers\nmanipulate the graph structure to evade detection. While some previous\napproaches have discussed this type of attack, none have fully addressed it\nwith a robust detection solution, limiting the practical applicability of\nPIDSes.\n  To address this challenge, we propose MirGuard, a robust anomaly detection\nframework that combines logic-aware multi-view augmentation with contrastive\nrepresentation learning. Rather than applying arbitrary structural\nperturbations, MirGuard introduces Logic-Aware Noise Injection (LNI) to\ngenerate semantically valid graph views, ensuring that all augmentations\npreserve the underlying causal semantics of the provenance data.

While prior research has primarily focused on identifying\nwhether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content\ninfluences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock\nmarket, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),\ncan be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we\ntake a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains\n154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale\nanalysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals\nthat people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text\nand visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We\npropose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify\nhow users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based\nagent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human\nresponses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response\nModel Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol\n(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM.

This\nwork aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable\nmachine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy\ncattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and\nusage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and\nresearchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to\nmake informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study\nutilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for\nseamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and\nexplains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special\nemphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,\nincluding the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing\ntechniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various\nhyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths\nfor activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the\nbest performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the\ntraining set and 0.99 on testing set).

We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both\ndirect and chain of thought prompting.\n  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform\npoorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25).

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically\nretrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that\ncombines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with\nstandardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware\nenrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by\nan LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise,\nactionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We\npropose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an\nauxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts.\nEmpirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our\napproach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR,\nalleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency.

Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information\non the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and\nhandwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA\nhave identified where elephants were poached and established connections among\nshipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are\nextremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to\nobtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely\ndocumented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting\nand analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,\nscalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085\nphotographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period\n(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000\nindividual markings, which were then labeled and described using\nstate-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring \"signature markings\"\nthat connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were\nobserved in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these\nseizures through traffickers involved in both shipments.

This paper investigates\naccessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature\nreview of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include\ndisabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.\nSecond, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that\noperationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)\npersona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and\nimplementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for\naccessibility.

These dynamic\ndialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy\nviolations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and\ndiscover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we\npresent a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and\ndefender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each\nsimulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.\nWhile the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)\nattempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)\nthrough persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space\nefficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel\nsearch with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation\ntrajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we\nfind that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to\nsophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,\nwhile defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification\nstate machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse\nscenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for\nbuilding privacy-aware agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM

D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically\ntrained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the\ncontrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the\nnumber of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding\nlocal minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has\nbeen achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,\nthe states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs\nthan in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two\ntechniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques\nwere (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many\npotentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if\nnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling\ntechniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at\nlater than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the\ntraining when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful\ndifferences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the\nfailure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement\nwhen using D-Wave-based sampling.

AKI stems from complex\nhemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection\nessential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment\nwith intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable\nmachine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with\ncirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,\nidentifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU\nstays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological\nvariables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included\npreprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class\nbalancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,\nnaive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,\naccuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.\n  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI\n0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged\npartial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,\nand altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting\nactionable targets.\n  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk\nstratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.\nIts high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk\npatients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.\nExternal validation and integration into electronic health record systems are\nwarranted.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac04\uacbd\ubcc0 \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uae30 \uae09\uc131 \uc2e0\uc7a5 \uc190\uc0c1(AKI) \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac04\uacbd\ubcc0\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc0ac\ub9dd\ub960\uacfc \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \ud569\ubcd1\uc99d\uc744 \ub3d9\ubc18\ud558\ub294 \uc9c4\ud589\uc131 \uac04 \uc9c8\ud658\uc774\uba70, AKI\ub294 \uc785\uc6d0 \ud658\uc790\uc758 50%\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ud658\uc728\uc744 \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "method": "MIMIC-IV v2.2 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \ud68c\uace0\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uace0, ICU\uc5d0 \uc785\uc6d0\ud55c 1240\uba85\uc758 \uc131\uc778 \uac04\uacbd\ubcc0 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LASSO \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f SMOTE \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uade0\ud615\ud654\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "LightGBM\uc774 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc8fc\uc694 \uc608\uce21 \ubcc0\uc218\ub294 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uac04\uacbd\ubcc0-AKI \uae30\uc804\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4\uc774\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LightGBM \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac04\uacbd\ubcc0 ICU \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uae30 AKI \uc704\ud5d8 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc678\ubd80 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc30\uacbd: \uac04\uacbd\ubcc0\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc0ac\ub9dd\ub960\uacfc \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \ud569\ubcd1\uc99d\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc9c4\ud589\uc131 \uac04 \uc9c8\ud658\uc73c\ub85c, \uae09\uc131 \uc2e0\uc7a5 \uc190\uc0c1(AKI)\uc740 \uc785\uc6d0 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \ucd5c\ub300 50%\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\ud6c4\ub97c \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

It is a foundational principle across\nmajor data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this\nprinciple have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions\nresulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the\nrelevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning\n(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an\nemerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).\nAt the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often\naddresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the\nconnection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,\ncomplicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the\nterminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research\ncommunities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework\nfor DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of\nminimization.

However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining\nwith clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be\nresource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning\nand Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on\ntransformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach\nrequires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the\nmodel architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.\nTechnically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a\npre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous\ntheoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists\ndetection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable\nassumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate\nthe effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy\nloss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four\nadvanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art\nretraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness\nagainst diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on

It proposes an adaptive resource\norchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method\nintroduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows\ndifferent resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and\nschedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better\nable to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental\ncharacteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to\nintegrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy\nlearning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time\nlocal performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism\nimproves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A\nunified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a\nrepresentative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key\nmetrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy\nconvergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate\nstrong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental\nscenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with\nhigh concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency\nrelationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale\nscheduling environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c

The method establishes a federated training framework\ninvolving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private\nresource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is\noptimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while\npreserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage\npatterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This\nallows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while\nsharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance\nis used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and\nstability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a\ncloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study\nevaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise\ninjection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's\nrobustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as\nPrecision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in\nvarious complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical\npotential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud\ncomputing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize\nrecurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to\ncapture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this\npaper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline\ndecomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the\nproblem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component\ndecomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method\nfirst determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component\nsolely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm.

Neurologists must\nbalance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional\ndisability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate\nor abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and\nneuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current\napproaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive\nmethods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited\ndue to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction\nuncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not\nonly predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence\nmeasures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation\nto maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a\nconformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in\nadvance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our\napproach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain\nstable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from\n631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our\ntwo-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then\npredicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework\nachieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared\nto traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term\nplanning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting.

However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously\nmodel this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional\nconsistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we\npropose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from\nvisual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically\ninterpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE\nmodels neural representations as continuous probability distributions via\nprobabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual\nsemantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic\ntransmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response\nmanifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in\nsubject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain\nadapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes\nhigh-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited\nfMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional\nconsistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing\ninterpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability.

With large\nfoundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL\nthrough cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the\nrapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients\nto quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon\npast experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced\nInitialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and\ncross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations\nfor learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering\nprocess at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the\noptimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and\nwithin each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer\nfor each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and\nintra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that\ncollaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and\noptimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,\nincluding dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's\nadvantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Federated Knowledge-Enhanced Initialization\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uacfc\uac70 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc5d0 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FedKEI\ub294 \uacfc\uac70 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uad50\ucc28 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc774\uc804\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\uc73c\ub85c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \uac04 \ubb34\uac8c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 FedKEI\uac00 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FedKEI\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc774\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \uae30\uad00 \uac04\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FM)\uc774 \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c FL\uc758 FM \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae09\uc18d\ud788 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c, \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uacfc\uac70 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc5d0 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\ub09c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uad50\ucc28 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc774\uc804\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Federated Knowledge-Enhanced Initialization(FedKEI)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Defending\nagainst backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while\npreserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we\npropose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the\nzero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By\nintegrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,\nCLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.\nTo address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against\ndiverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the\nmultimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client\nsamples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and\neliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed\naligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset\nusing prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive\nexperiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.\nCompared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in\nASR, i.e., 2.03\\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving\naverage MA by 7.92\\% and 0.48\\%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLIP-Fed\ub294 \ube44\ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc804\ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c-\uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec \ub610\ub294 \uae68\ub057\ud55c \uc11c\ubc84 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "CLIP-Fed\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud6c4 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc5c6\uc774 \uc11c\ubc84 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc0f \uc99d\uac15\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CLIP-Fed\ub294 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 ASR\uc744 CIFAR-10\uc5d0\uc11c 2.03%, CIFAR-10-LT\uc5d0\uc11c 1.35% \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 MA\ub97c \uac01\uac01 7.92%, 0.48% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CLIP-Fed\ub294 \ube44\ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL) \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc774\ub098 \uae68\ub057\ud55c \uc11c\ubc84 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube44\ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc804\ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c-\uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c FL \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CLIP-Fed\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Chu", "Reza Rafeh"], "title": "A Hierarchical IDS for Zero-Day Attack Detection in Internet of Medical Things Networks", "comment": "13 pages, and 4 figures", "summary": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but\nremains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data\nhijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,\nheterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),\nmaking traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable\ndue to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized\nIDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays\nor network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT\ndevices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight\nIDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them\nexposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We\npropose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks\nand distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near\nEdge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or\nOne Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm.

Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,\ndemonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate\nand achievable performance.

Mamba, a recent\nsequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior\ncomputational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While\nthis advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge\ndevices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for\ndeploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive\nend-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying\nMamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by\nreplacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware\nalternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation\nand exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an\napproximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable\nparameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,\nand MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves\ncomparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\\times$\nfewer parameters.

In parallel, compute capabilities\nhave steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few\ndecades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates\nthe challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade\nincreased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present\nXQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude\nreduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial\naccuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.\nWe accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,\ninstead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and\nValues on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\\times$\nmemory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to\n$\\sim 7.7\\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to\nthe FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values\nare similar across layers.

While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in\nsimple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general\ntensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we\nleverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general\ntensorized models. We introduce the notion of \\emph{Norm Deviation} as a global\nmeasure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using\ngradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation\nis governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.\nMotivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,\n\\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this\nregularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our\nexperiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or\nimproved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0e4\ud504\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc778\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654(SAM)\ub294 \uacfc\ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc784.", "motivation": "SAM\uc758 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uaddc\uc81c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud150\uc11c\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\ub178\ub984 \ud3b8\ucc28(Norm Deviation)\ub77c\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c SAM\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ud750\ub984 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568.", "result": "DAS\uac00 SAM\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \ub610\ub294 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud568.", "conclusion": "DAS\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc801\uc751 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ucf54\uc5b4 \ub178\ub984\uc744 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec SAM\uc758 \uaddc\uc81c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc784.", "translated_summary": "Sharpness-Aware Minimization(SAM)\uc740 \uacfc\ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\uc220\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ucf54\uc5b4 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ubd88\ubcc0 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c SAM\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uaddc\uc81c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud150\uc11c\ud654\ub41c \ub610\ub294 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ubd88\ubcc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \ub35c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18 \ud150\uc11c\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c SAM\uc758 \ub178\ub984 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucf54\uc5b4 \ub178\ub984 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uce21\uc815\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c '\ub178\ub984 \ud3b8\ucc28(Norm Deviation)'\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, SAM\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uadf8 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ud750\ub984 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SAM\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ub178\ub984 \ud3b8\ucc28 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ucf54\uc5b4 \ub178\ub984\uacfc \uadf8 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ud06c\uae30 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \ud798\uc785\uc5b4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uaddc\uc81c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc801\uc751 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ucf54\uc5b4 \ub178\ub984\uc744 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 '\ud3b8\ucc28 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1(Deviation-Aware Scaling, DAS)'\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud150\uc11c \uc644\uc131, \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, DAS\uac00 SAM\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \ub610\ub294 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e0 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, their decision-making remains\nlargely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical\napplications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability\ntechniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight\ninto individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a\nself-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation\nas part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured\ncontext vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,\nclustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A\nlightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation\nvector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent\nembedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural\nlanguage explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)\nguiding the GNN itself via a \"text-injection\" mechanism that feeds explanations\nback into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph\ndatasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,\nand GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive\nclassification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.\nRepository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node.", "AI": {"tldr": "X-Node\ub294 \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \uc608\uce21 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc77c\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc124\uba85 GNN \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, GNN\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 GNN \uc124\uba85 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ub178\ub4dc \uacb0\uc815\uc774\ub098 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub9cc \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "X-Node\ub294 \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc77c\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uace0, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, GNN\uc758 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\uc1a1 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ub418\uba39\uc774\ub294 '\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785' \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MedMNIST\uc640 MorphoMNIST\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 GCN, GAT, GIN \ubc31\ubcf8\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec X-Node\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "X-Node\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uac04 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ube44\uc804 \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide\ntailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a\ndedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual\ninformation-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.\nBy calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism\ncorrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of\nmutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,\nminority-class features.

We tested EDAPT across nine datasets\ncovering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over\nconventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining\npopulation-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised\ndomain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs\nefficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade\nhardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than\nits allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway\ntoward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "EDAPT\ub294 \ub1cc-\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc800\ud558 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc815 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "BCI\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc800\ud558 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac04 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \uc7ac\ubcf4\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub450\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "EDAPT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uae30\uc900 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c \ud6c4, \uc2e0\uacbd \ud328\ud134 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "EDAPT\ub294 9\uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c 3\uac1c\uc758 BCI \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EDAPT\ub294 BCI \ub3c4\uc785\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \uc904\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ubcf4\uc815 \uc5c6\ub294 BCI\ub85c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub1cc-\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(BCI)\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c drift\ub418\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac04\uc5d0 \ub2e4\ub974\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \uc7ac\ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\ub294 \uc784\ubb34 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \ube44\uc885\uc18d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 EDAPT\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we\naddress this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where\nmulti-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the\nSWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,\ndocker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we\npropose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates\nimmediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined\nthreshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified\nand kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates\n(47.6\\% \\rightarrow 93.8\\% and 22.0\\% \\rightarrow 86.0\\%) and modification\nrates (19.6\\% \\rightarrow 23.8\\% and 12.0\\% \\rightarrow 42.0\\%), while avoiding\npolicy degradation caused by reward misalignment.

Despite an extensive body of work for explaining\ntheir predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be\nattributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel\nprobabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation\nmethods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of\ngradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been\ndiscovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input\nperturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation\nhyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to\ninconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed\nformalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)\nan aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our\ntheoretical results through quantitative evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc124\uba85 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uac01\uc885 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7f4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc124\uba85 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc2a4\ud018\uc5b4\ub4dc \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc640 \uc785\ub825 \uad50\ub780\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7f4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub86f\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, SmoothGrad\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc124\uba85 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uad50\ub780 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc124\uba85\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud45c\uc900 \uad50\ub780 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc SpectralLens\ub77c\ub294 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc8fc\uc758\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc124\uba85 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc778\ud558\ub294 \ub9cc\uc5f0\ud55c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7f4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc2a4\ud018\uc5b4\ub4dc \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc640 \uc785\ub825 \uad50\ub780\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ub4f1 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc870\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c SmoothGrad\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc124\uba85 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \uad50\ub780 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc124\uba85\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub354 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud615\uc2dd\uc8fc\uc758\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\uc900 \uad50\ub780 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc SpectralLens\ub77c\ub294 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub05d\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To address\nthese limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology\nEnhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC\nincorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to\nachieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality\nspatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the\nSpatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module\nincreases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial\nneighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby\nproduces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings.

Existing defenses, including host\nbased patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited\nscalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with\nembedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch\nvalidation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning\nFrom Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nautonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.\nREFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven\nby online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN\nguarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways\n(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real\nnetwork traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training\nLLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability\nfixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging\ncurrent LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that\ntranslates language context (vulnerability description) into network\nenforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the\nOnline Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22\nfamilies of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1\npercent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of\n3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices).

When\nemploying family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes\nhomogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance\nindependent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks\nnear a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property\nholds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid\nvariables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and\ndiverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium\nNonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous\ntemperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration\nspace without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were\npreviously designed phenomenologically.

The proposed software framework for\nmachine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data\nsets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.\nAlthough machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many\nproblems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples\nfor the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient\nnumber of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is\nchallenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.\nTherefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of\nantennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data\nsets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep\nlearning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This\nstudy demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end\nCPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can\nachieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end\nCPU.

Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which\nseverely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent\npersonalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,\nwe propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via\ndual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen\nbackbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we\ndevelop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization\nand individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared\nprimary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated\nrefinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The\nanalytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity\ninvariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains\nidentical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all\nother clients.

To accurately identify\nallergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein\nLanguage Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion\nparameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently\noutperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that\nclosely resemble difficult real-world scenarios.

In practice, each hospital may need\nto train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to\nmatch local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures\nsuch as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may\nrequire non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nirregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models\ncoherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,\nremains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that\nencodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a\nshared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified\nmodels. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them\nthrough a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and\nknowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and\ndistributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two\nMedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified\nlearning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and\ntested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large\ndistribution shifts.

While\nconventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often\nresult in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such\nas time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models\nshow potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series\ngenerative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate\nhigh-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not\nentirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series\nSuper-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of\nupsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have\ninsufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning\nparadigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training\nrequires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in\nupsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,\nthis paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial\nTransformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth\nhigh-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the\nintroduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling\ntasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application\nscenario is improved by 13%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs)\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5c5\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc7ac\ud45c\ubcf8\ud654\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uad50\uc721\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5c5\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\uc874 \ubcf4\uac04 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc5c5\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1\uadfc \uc624\ucc28(RMSE)\ub97c 9% \uc904\uc774\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21 \uc81c\uc5b4(MPC) \uc751\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 13% \uac1c\uc120\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5c5\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc758 \uc7ac\ud45c\ubcf8\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5c5\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc774\ub098 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc288\ud37c \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uae09 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc6d0\ub798 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc5c5\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc758 \uc815\uc758\uc640 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc288\ud37c \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub098 \ubcf4\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc785\ub825\uc758 \uc800\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc774 \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \uc5c6\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5c5\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc774 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294 \uc5c5\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc751\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc6a9 \ud328\ub7ec\ub3c5\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5b8\uae09\ub41c \uc5c5\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs)\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubcf4\uac04 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5c5\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1\uadfc \uc624\ucc28(RMSE)\ub97c 9% \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21 \uc81c\uc5b4(MPC) \uc751\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 13% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4."}}

Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict\nassumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.\nIn this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing\nvariance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy\ngradients while maintaining general assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MORL)\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\uc21c\ub418\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MORL\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95(PGM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uac10\uc18c \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, MORL\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MORL\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MORL)\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uc885\uc885 \uc0c1\ucda9\ud558\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uade0\ud615\uc788\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c\ud654 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 MORL \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 RL\uacfc \ub9c8\ucc2c\uac00\uc9c0\ub85c \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95(PGM)\uc740 MORL\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 MORL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c PGM\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc591\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc804 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ub4e4\uc740 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 PGM\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc783\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uac10\uc18c \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Previous works have observed a high correlation between\n$\\Delta\\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important\nobjects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate\n$\\Delta\\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a\nprotein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a\nnew approach to $\\Delta\\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead\nleveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's\nconformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\\Delta\\Delta G$ into a\nsequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a\nstructure-based component estimated by an energy model.

For example, impervious surfaces heat up and\nspeed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with\nconcomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth\nSystem models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric\nprocesses at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to\nforecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and\nconsequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,\nwe propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover\nchange forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem\nconditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable\nproperties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and\ndemonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on\nimperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire\nconterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for\ndecadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline\nthat assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a\nyear held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\\geq\n0.7\\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding\ncorroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns\nfrom historical data that are significant for projecting future change.\nFinally, we discuss future

Under such data scarcity, almost all existing\npipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently\noverfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an\nInformation-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic\nshortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.\nSpecifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the\ninformation density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking\nstrategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional\nde novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with\ngreater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the\noriginal TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate\nmolecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS\noptimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five\nphysics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of\nfreedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the\nzero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to\n64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal\nmol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus\n3 for the original TargetDiff.

Our proposed \\rmab\\;\nalgorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper\nconfidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics\nand their variations. We further establish that \\rmab\\; achieves\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\\frac{1}{4}} T^{\\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by\nleveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical\nframework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5 \ub3c4\ubc15 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \ud574\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 RMAB \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\ub529 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc0c1\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uac04(UCB) \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uadf8 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \rmab\rights;\uac00 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 RMAB \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub290\uc2a8\ud55c \ud6c4\ud68c \uc815\uc758\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\ud68c \uacbd\uacc4 $\tilde{\text{O}}(N^{2} B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 RMAB\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5 \ub3c4\ubc15\uae30(RMAB)\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac01 \ud314\uc774 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc804\uc774 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(MDP)\ub97c \ub530\ub978\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc758\ub8cc \ubc0f \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801 \ub3d9\uc801\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae68\uc838 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 RMAB \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc548\uae41\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc720\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc608\uc0b0 $B$\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uac16\ub294 $N$-\ud314 \ubb34\uc7a5 RMAB\uc744 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \rmab\rights; \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc804\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uadf8 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\ub529 \ucc3d \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uacfc \uc0c1\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uac04(UCB) \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \rmab\rights;\uac00 \ub290\uc2a8\ud55c \ud6c4\ud68c\uc758 \uc815\uc758\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 RMAB \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 $\tilde{\text{O}}(N^{2} B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ \ud6c4\ud68c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While Transformer\narchitectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in\nlong-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.\nThis review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,\nincluding dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and\nconsolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We\norganize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional\nobjectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),\nmemory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and\nintegration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative\nretrieval).

This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally\nrich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties\ntrust that the provided attributions are indeed \"good,\" especially when they\nare used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this\npaper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification\nparadigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover\nlearns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a\nresource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides\nformal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of\nProbably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover\nand Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that\nare {\\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean\nSquared Error) with probability 1-{\\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover\narbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this\nis detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with\nprobability {\\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's\nworkload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must\nperform, scales only as O(1/{\\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset\nsize.

Models using simulators explore broad design\nspaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental\npriors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models\non the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\\% of molecules\nproposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce\n\\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature\ndescribing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines\nfor discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing\ninformation in concise fair-use facts. \\ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million\npairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.\nSMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,\nCLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets\nand evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \\ourdataset~is\nhighly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised\nprediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M\nlearnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and\nclassification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.\nModels built with \\ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for\nnovel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly\nas effective.
