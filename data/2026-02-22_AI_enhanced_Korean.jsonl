We introduce HiVAE, a hierarchical variational architecture that scales ToM reasoning to realistic spatiotemporal domains. Inspired by the belief-desire-intention structure of human cognition, our three-level VAE hierarchy achieves substantial performance improvements on a 3,185-node campus navigation task.

A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \\emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^\u03c0$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($\u03a0(\u03c0)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $\u03a0(\u03c0)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $\u03c1(E^{\\mathrm{s}}+E^{\\mathrm{a}}\u03a0(\u03c0)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \ubc97\uc5b4\ub0a8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc800\uc8fc\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc804\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\ud574\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\uc774 \uc720\ub3c4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud654\ub41c \ube14\ub85d \uc88c\ud45c \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc800\uc8fc\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc740 \uac12 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc9c0\uc218 \uac10\uc18c \uc18d\uc131(EDP)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 EDP\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc870\uac74\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub41c \uacbd\uacc4(\uc608: \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\ub313\uac12)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ucc45 \uc790\uccb4\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\uc774 \uc815\ucc45 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ud604\uc0c1\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ud589\ub82c $H^\u03c0$\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\ud574\ub85c, \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc($E^{\text{s}}$) \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9($E^{\text{a}}$)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc($\u03a0(\u03c0)$)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd84\ud574\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc815\ucc45(\uc791\uc740 $\u03a0(\u03c0)$)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\uc774 \uc720\ub3c4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131-\ucd5c\uc801\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc218 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc870\uac74 $\u03c1(E^{\text{s}}+E^{\text{a}}\u03a0(\u03c0)) < 1$\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ub178\ub984 \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uac74\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \ub354 \uac15\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ubc18\uc9c0\ub984\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc785\uc99d\ub41c \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud654\ub41c \ube14\ub85d \uc88c\ud45c \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Successful decentralized decision-making often depends not only on good individual actions, but on selecting compatible actions across agents to synchronize behavior, avoid conflicts, and satisfy global constraints. In this paper, we propose Action Graph Policies (AGP), that model dependencies among agents' available action choices. It constructs, what we call, \\textit{coordination contexts}, that enable agents to condition their decisions on global action dependencies. Theoretically, we show that AGPs induce a strictly more expressive joint policy compared to fully independent policies and can realize coordinated joint actions that are provably more optimal than greedy execution even from centralized value-decomposition methods. Empirically, we show that AGP achieves 80-95\\% success on canonical coordination tasks with partial observability and anti-coordination penalties, where other MARL methods reach only 10-25\\%. We further demonstrate that AGP consistently outperforms these baselines in diverse multi-agent environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ucc45 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc18c\uac1c", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "Action Graph Policies (AGP)\ub77c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc120\ud0dd \uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud568.", "result": "AGP\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uba70, \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uac00\uce58 \ubd84\ud574 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801 \uc2e4\ud589\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c. \ub610\ud55c AGP\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 80-95%\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 10-25%\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ub428.", "conclusion": "AGP\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ud589\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud615\ud0dc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc740 \uc88b\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud589\ub3d9\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uba70 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud638\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ub824 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc120\ud0dd \uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 Action Graph Policies (AGP)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, AGP\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \ub354 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uba70, \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uac00\uce58 \ubd84\ud574 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801 \uc2e4\ud589\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, AGP\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30\uc131\uacfc \ubc18\uc870\uc815 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 80-95%\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 MARL \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 10-25%\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c AGP\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Traditional approaches rely on static, offline-trained models that cannot adapt to evolving operational conditions, while LLM-based monolithic systems demand prohibitive memory and latency, rendering them impractical for on-site edge deployment. We introduce SEMAS, a self-evolving hierarchical multi-agent system that distributes specialized agents across Edge, Fog, and Cloud computational tiers. Edge agents perform lightweight feature extraction and pre-filtering; Fog agents execute diversified ensemble detection with dynamic consensus voting; and Cloud agents continuously optimize system policies via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) while maintaining asynchronous, non-blocking inference. The framework incorporates LLM-based response generation for explainability and federated knowledge aggregation for adaptive policy distribution. This architecture enables resource-aware specialization without sacrificing real-time performance or model interpretability. Empirical evaluation on two industrial benchmarks (Boiler Emulator and Wind Turbine) demonstrates that SEMAS achieves superior anomaly detection performance with exceptional stability under adaptation, sustains prediction accuracy across evolving operational contexts, and delivers substantial latency improvements enabling genuine real-time deployment. Ablation studies confirm that PPO-driven policy evolution, consensus voting, and federated aggregation each contribute materially to system effectiveness.

With minimal test cases of information and access security, NESSiE reveals safety-relevant failures that should not exist, given the low complexity of the tasks. NESSiE is intended as a lightweight, easy-to-use sanity check for language model safety and, as such, is not sufficient for guaranteeing safety in general -- but we argue that passing this test is necessary for any deployment. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs do not reach 100% on NESSiE and thus fail our necessary condition of language model safety, even in the absence of adversarial attacks. Our Safe & Helpful (SH) metric allows for direct comparison of the two requirements, showing models are biased toward being helpful rather than safe. We further find that disabled reasoning for some models, but especially a benign distraction context degrade model performance. Overall, our results underscore the critical risks of deploying such models as autonomous agents in the wild.

This paper proposes STDSH-MARL (Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stage Hypergraph based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning), a scalable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that follows a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. The proposed method captures spatio-temporal dependencies through a novel dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism that models interactions across both spatial and temporal hyperedges. In addition, a hybrid discrete action space is introduced to jointly determine the next signal phase configuration and its corresponding green duration, enabling more adaptive signal timing decisions. Experiments conducted on a corridor network under five traffic scenarios demonstrate that STDSH-MARL consistently improves multimodal performance and provides clear benefits for public transportation priority. Compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance. Further ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of STDSH-MARL, with temporal hyperedges identified as the most influential factor driving the observed performance gains.", "AI":

While Adam uses adaptive moment estimates to promote stability, Muon utilizes the weight layers' matrix structure via orthogonalized momentum, showing superior performance in large language model training. We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "NAMO\uc640 NAMO-D\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ube44\uc728\uc5d0\uc11c \uc798 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc29\ud5a5\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc12d\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "NAMO\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uc2a4\ud15d \uc0ac\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c1\uad50 \ubaa8\uba58\ud140\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, NAMO-D\ub294 \ud074\ub7a8\ud504\ub41c \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub300\uac01 \ud589\ub82c\ub85c \uc9c1\uad50 \ubaa8\uba58\ud140\uc744 \uc624\ub978\ucabd\uc73c\ub85c \uacf1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "NAMO\uc640 NAMO-D \ubaa8\ub450 AdamW \ubc0f Muon \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "NAMO-D\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub7a8\ud504 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc798 \uc815\ub3c8\ub41c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ub294 \ucd94\uac00 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ube44\uc728\uc5d0\uc11c \uc798 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc29\ud5a5\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc12d\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance. Node Learning does not discard existing paradigms, but places them within a broader decentralised perspective", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\uc758 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ub3d9\ub8cc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\ub294 Decentralized Learning \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 Node Learning\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uc758 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\uc1a1, \uc9c0\uc5f0, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44 \ubc0f \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc13c\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Node Learning\uc740 \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \ub85c\uceec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ud611\ub825\uc774 \uc720\uc775\ud560 \ub54c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uad50\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ub098 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uacc4\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uacb9\uce68\uacfc \ud655\uc0b0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ud30c\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130, \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4, \ubaa9\ud45c \ubc0f \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Node Learning\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud3d0\uae30\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \ub354\uc6b1 \ub113\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uad00\uc810 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \uc704\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI\uc758 \uc5e3\uc9c0\ub85c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\uc1a1, \uc9c0\uc5f0, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44 \ubc0f \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc13c\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c\ud558\uba70 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uace0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ub3d9\ub8cc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 Node Learning\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub178\ub4dc\ub294 \ub85c\uceec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ud611\ub825\uc774 \uc720\uc775\ud560 \ub54c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uae30\ud68c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ub098 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uacc4\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uacb9\uce68\uacfc \ud655\uc0b0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ud30c\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd94\uc0c1 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130, \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4, \ubaa9\ud45c \ubc0f \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uc218\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac1c\ub150 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc \ub300\ube44\ud558\uba70, \ud1b5\uc2e0, \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4, \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubc0f \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud568\uc758\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud55c\ub2e4.

We analyze 28 LLM-based penetration testing systems and evaluate five representative implementations across three benchmarks of increasing complexity. Our analysis reveals two distinct failure modes: Type A failures stem from capability gaps (missing tools, inadequate prompts) that engineering readily addresses, while Type B failures persist regardless of tooling due to planning and state management limitations. We show that Type B failures share a root cause that is largely invariant to the underlying LLM: agents lack real-time task difficulty estimation. As a result, agents misallocate effort, over-commit to low-value branches, and exhaust context before completing attack chains.\n  Based on this insight, we present Excalibur, a penetration testing agent that couples strong tooling with difficulty-aware planning. A Tool and Skill Layer eliminates Type A failures through typed interfaces and retrieval-augmented knowledge. A Task Difficulty Assessment (TDA) mechanism addresses Type B failures by estimating tractability through four measurable dimensions (horizon estimation, evidence confidence, context load, and historical success) and uses these estimates to guide exploration-exploitation decisions within an Evidence-Guided Attack Tree Search (EGATS) framework. Excalibur achieves up to 91% task completion on CTF benchmarks with frontier models (39 to 49% relative improvement over baselines) and compromises 4 of 5 hosts on the GOAD Active Directory environment versus 2 by prior systems. These results show that difficulty-aware planning yields consistent end-to-end gains across models and addresses a limitation that model scaling alone does not eliminate.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e4\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. 28\uac1c\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 5\uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc778 Excalibur\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub974\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "28\uac1c\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 5\uac1c\uc758 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 3\uac1c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To measure agent vulnerabilities to such risks, we present AgentLAB, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating LLM agent susceptibility to adaptive, long-horizon attacks. Currently, AgentLAB supports five novel attack types including intent hijacking, tool chaining, task injection, objective drifting, and memory poisoning, spanning 28 realistic agentic environments, and 644 security test cases. Leveraging AgentLAB, we evaluate representative LLM agents and find that they remain highly susceptible to long-horizon attacks; moreover, defenses designed for single-turn interactions fail to reliably mitigate long-horizon threats. We anticipate that AgentLAB will serve as a valuable benchmark for tracking progress on securing LLM agents in practical settings.

We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \\pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \\pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub77c\uc774\ud504\ub871 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc2b5\ub4dd\uacfc \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c \uc720\uc9c0 \uac04\uc758 \uae34\uc7a5\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ube44\uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\uc815\ub82c\uc740 \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub77c\uc774\ud504\ub871 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud568.", "method": "Gemma3-4B \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc881\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc758 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uc815\ub82c \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "LoRA \ub7ad\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ube44\uc815\ub82c\uc774 \ub2e8\uc870\ub86d\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \ud3c9\uac00\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ube44\uc815\ub82c\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828 \ud63c\ud569\ubb3c\uc5d0\uc11c 10%\uc758 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ube44\uc815\ub82c \uc800\ud558\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \uad50\uc721 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud6c4 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud3c9\uc0dd \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub04a\uc784\uc5c6\uc774 \uc801\uc751\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc2b5\ub4dd\uacfc \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c \uc720\uc9c0 \uac04\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uae34\uc7a5\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc881\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc758 \uc720\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uae34\uae09 \ube44\uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Jordan"], "title": "Towards Anytime-Valid Statistical Watermarking", "comment": null, "summary": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient mechanisms to distinguish machine-generated content from human text. While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uae30\uacc4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 e-value \uae30\ubc18 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Anchored E-Watermarking\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \uc5b8\uc81c\ub4e0\uc9c0 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c, \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900 \ub300\ube44 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uade0 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 13-15% \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ub418\uba70, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc640 \uc778\uac04 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc774 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \uacb0\uc5ec\uc774\uace0, \ub2e4\ub978 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uace0\uc815 \ud638\ub77c\uc774\uc98c \uac00\uc124 \uac80\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc870\uae30 \uc911\ub2e8\uc744 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc5b8\uc81c\ub4e0\uc9c0 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 e-value \uae30\ubc18 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Anchored E-Watermarking\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uba54\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc911\ub2e8\uc774 Type-I \uc624\ub958 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ubb34\ud6a8\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc288\ud37c \ub9c8\ud2f4\uac8c\uc77c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc5b8\uc81c\ub4e0\uc9c0 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc575\ucee4 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub85c\uadf8 \uc131\uc7a5\ub960\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801 e-value\ub97c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uae30\ub300 \uc911\ub2e8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc740 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\ub85c \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ub418\uba70, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf \uc8fc\uc785\uc744

Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\\%$ proof success (vs.\\ $80\\%$ for a strong baseline). Together, these results demonstrate that practical, large-scale automated formalization of mathematical literature is within reach.

Accepted to ICLR 2026", "summary": "Value decomposition is a core approach for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods still rely on a single optimal action and struggle to adapt when the underlying value function shifts during training, often converging to suboptimal policies. To address this limitation, we propose Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q), which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain alternative high-value actions. Incorporating these sub-value functions into a Softmax-based behavior policy, S2Q encourages persistent exploration and enables $Q^{\\text{tot}}$ to adjust quickly to the changing optima. Experiments on challenging MARL benchmarks confirm that S2Q consistently outperforms various MARL algorithms, demonstrating improved adaptability and overall performance.

Positioned as a \"methodological experiment,\" this study proposes an AI Agent-based collaborative research workflow (Agentic Workflow) for humanities and social science research. Taiwan's Claude.ai usage data (N = 7,729 conversations, November 2025) from the Anthropic Economic Index (AEI) serves as the empirical vehicle for validating the feasibility of this methodology.\n  This study operates on two levels: the primary level is the design and validation of a methodological framework - a seven-stage modular workflow grounded in three principles: task modularization, human-AI division of labor, and verifiability, with each stage delineating clear roles for human researchers (research judgment and ethical decisions) and AI Agents (information retrieval and text generation); the secondary level is the empirical analysis of AEI Taiwan data - serving as an operational demonstration of the workflow's application to secondary data research, showcasing both the process and output quality (see Appendix A).\n  This study contributes by proposing a replicable AI collaboration framework for humanities and social science researchers, and identifying three operational modes of human-AI collaboration - direct execution, iterative refinement, and human-led - through reflexive documentation of the operational process. This taxonomy reveals the irreplaceability of human judgment in research question formulation, theoretical interpretation, contextualized reasoning, and ethical reflection.

To bridge this gap, we present WarpRec, a high-performance framework that eliminates this trade-off through a novel, backend-agnostic architecture. It includes 50+ state-of-the-art algorithms, 40 metrics, and 19 filtering and splitting strategies that seamlessly transition from local execution to distributed training and optimization. The framework enforces ecological responsibility by integrating CodeCarbon for real-time energy tracking, showing that scalability need not come at the cost of scientific integrity or sustainability. Furthermore, WarpRec anticipates the shift toward Agentic AI, leading Recommender Systems to evolve from static ranking engines into interactive tools within the Generative AI ecosystem. In summary, WarpRec not only bridges the gap between academia and industry but also can serve as the architectural backbone for the next generation of sustainable, agent-ready Recommender Systems.

The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "KLong\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf9\ub3c4\ub85c \uae34 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0 \uaebc\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uada4\uc801 \ubd84\ud560 SFT\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc778 RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "KLong\uc740 PaperBench\uc5d0\uc11c Kimi K2 Thinking\ubcf4\ub2e4 11.28% \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KLong\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucf54\ub529 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \ud0c1\uc6d4\ud568\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 KLong\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uada4\uc801 \ubd84\ud560 SFT\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc778 RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 SFT \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c\ub85c \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc5f0\uad6c \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub8e8\ube0c\ub9ad\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc778 Research-Factory\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Claude 4.5 Sonnet(Thinking)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc81c\ub41c \uc218\ucc9c \uac1c\uc758 \uae34 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uadf9\ub3c4\ub85c \uae34 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ucd08\uae30 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uace0 \ud6c4\uc18d \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\ucd95\ud558\uba70 \ud558\uc704 \uada4\uc801 \uac04\uc758 \uacb9\uce68\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uada4\uc801 \ubd84\ud560 SFT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud574\uacb0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ud0c0\uc784\uc544\uc6c3\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub098\ub204\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 RL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc KLong\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c KLong(106B)\uc740 PaperBench\uc5d0\uc11c Kimi K2 Thinking(1T)\uc744 11.28% \uc55e\uc11c\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc740 SWE-bench Verified \ubc0f MLE-bench\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ucf54\ub529 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A Hybrid FL-Enabled Ensemble Approach For Lung Disease Diagnosis Leveraging a Combination of SWIN Transformer and CNN is the combination of cutting-edge technology of AI and Federated Learning. Since, medi- cal specialists and hospitals will have shared data space, based on that data, with the help of Artificial Intelligence and integration of federated learning, we can introduce a secure and distributed system for medical data processing and create an efficient and reliable system. The proposed hybrid model enables the detection of COVID-19 and Pneumonia based on x-ray reports. We will use advanced and the latest available tech- nology offered by Tensorflow and Keras along with Microsoft-developed Vision Transformer, that can help to fight against the pandemic that the world has to fight together as a united. We focused on using the latest available CNN models (DenseNet201, Inception V3, VGG 19) and the Transformer model SWIN Transformer in order to prepare our hy- brid model that can provide a reliable solution as a helping hand for the physician in the medical field. In this research, we will discuss how the Federated learning-based Hybrid AI model can improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis and severity prediction of a patient using the real-time continual learning approach and how the integration of federated learn- ing can ensure hybrid model security and keep the authenticity of the information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uacfc \ud398\ub354\ub808\uc774\ud2f0\ub4dc \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 COVID-19 \ubc0f \ud3d0\ub834 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uacfc \ud398\ub354\ub808\uc774\ud2f0\ub4dc \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc FL_ENABLED \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 SWIN Transform \ubc0f CNN\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "COVID-19 \ubc0f \ud3d0\ub834\uc744 X\uc120 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud398\ub354\ub808\uc774\ud2f0\ub4dc \ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ud658\uc790 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacc4\uc0b0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \ube44\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \ubc0f \uc758\ud559 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \ucc3d\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
