Natural human communication relies on shared context and unstated constraints that speakers expect listeners to infer. Current agentic benchmarks test explicit instruction-following but fail to evaluate whether agents can reason about implicit requirements spanning accessibility needs, privacy boundaries, catastrophic risks, and contextual constraints. We present Implicit Intelligence, an evaluation framework testing whether AI agents can move beyond prompt-following to become genuine goal-fulfillers, paired with Agent-as-a-World (AaW), a harness where interactive worlds are defined in human-readable YAML files and simulated by language models. Our scenarios feature apparent simplicity in user requests, hidden complexity in correct solutions, and discoverability of constraints through environmental exploration. Evaluating 16 frontier and open-weight models across 205 scenarios, we find that even the best-performing model achieves only 48.3% scenario pass rate, revealing substantial room for improvement in bridging the gap between literal instruction-following and human-like contextual reasoning."}

While prior work has focused heavily on agent fine-tuning, tool interfaces-including natural language descriptions and parameter schemas-remain largely human-oriented and often become a bottleneck, especially when agents must select from large candidate tool sets. Existing approaches to improving tool interfaces rely on execution traces, which are frequently unavailable in cold-start or privacy-constrained settings, and typically optimize each tool independently, limiting scalability and generalization to unseen tools. We propose Trace-Free+, a curriculum learning framework that progressively transfers supervision from trace-rich settings to trace-free deployment, encouraging the model to abstract reusable interface-usage patterns and tool usage outcomes. To support this approach, we construct a large-scale dataset of high-quality tool interfaces using a structured workflow over a diverse collection of tools. Experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench show consistent gains on unseen tools, strong cross-domain generalization, and robustness as the number of candidate tools scales to over 100, demonstrating that tool interface optimization is a practical and deployable complement to agent fine-tuning."}

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations. We open source our code and provide pre-trained MIMIC agents and qualitative demos at: https://mimic-research.github.io."}

Most existing approaches improve only one aspect at a time, such as the communication topology, role assignment, or LLM routing, while treating each agent as a single, indivisible unit. This misses the opportunity to use mixtures of LLMs within an agent to strengthen role-specific abilities. We propose HieraMAS, a hierarchical collaboration framework that combines intra-node LLM mixtures with an inter-node communication topology. HieraMAS introduces supernodes, where each functional role is implemented by multiple heterogeneous LLMs using a propose-synthesis structure. Optimizing HieraMAS creates unique credit-assignment challenges: final task performance depends heavily on the underlying LLMs' capabilities, which can lead reinforcement methods to incorrectly reward suboptimal configurations. To address this, we use a two-stage algorithm: (1) multi-level reward attribution, which provides fine-grained feedback at both the node level and the overall system level; (2) graph classification for topology selection, which treats choosing the communication structure as a holistic decision rather than optimizing edges one by one. Experiments on reasoning and coding benchmarks show that HieraMAS substantially outperforms existing methods while also delivering better cost-performance trade-offs."}

We propose a federated framework for estimating a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) hazard model of bridge deterioration, enabling municipalities to collaboratively train a shared benchmark model without transferring raw inspection records. Each User holds local inspection data and trains a log-linear hazard model over three deterioration-direction transitions -- Good$\\to$Minor, Good$\\to$Severe, and Minor$\\to$Severe -- with covariates for bridge age, coastline distance, and deck area. Local optimization is performed via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent on the CTMC log-likelihood, and only a 12-dimensional pseudo-gradient vector is uploaded to a central server per communication round. The server aggregates User updates using sample-weighted Federated Averaging (FedAvg) with momentum and gradient clipping. All experiments in this paper are conducted on fully synthetic data generated from a known ground-truth parameter set with region-specific heterogeneity, enabling controlled evaluation of federated convergence behaviour. Simulation results across heterogeneous Users show consistent convergence of the average negative log-likelihood, with the aggregated gradient norm decreasing as User scale increases. Furthermore, the federated update mechanism provides a natural participation incentive: Users who register their local inspection datasets on a shared technical-standard platform receive in return the periodically updated global benchmark parameters -- information that cannot be obtained from local data alone -- thereby enabling evidence-based life-cycle planning without surrendering data sovereignty."}

This paper introduces OpenPort Protocol (OPP), a governance-first specification for exposing application tools through a secure server-side gateway that is model- and runtime-neutral and can bind to existing tool ecosystems. OpenPort defines authorization-dependent discovery, stable response envelopes with machine-actionable \\texttt{agent.*} reason codes, and an authorization model combining integration credentials, scoped permissions, and ABAC-style policy constraints. For write operations, OpenPort specifies a risk-gated lifecycle that defaults to draft creation and human review, supports time-bounded auto-execution under explicit policy, and enforces high-risk safeguards including preflight impact binding and idempotency. To address time-of-check/time-of-use drift in delayed approval flows, OpenPort also specifies an optional State Witness profile that revalidates execution-time preconditions and fails closed on state mismatch. Operationally, the protocol requires admission control (rate limits/quotas) with stable 429 semantics and structured audit events across allow/deny/fail paths so that client recovery and incident analysis are deterministic. We present a reference runtime and an executable governance toolchain (layered conformance profiles, negative security tests, fuzz/abuse regression, and release-gate scans) and evaluate the core profile at a pinned release tag using artifact-based, externally reproducible validation."}

We propose a data-centric framework that learns verbalization for LLM-based recommendation. Using reinforcement learning, a verbalization agent transforms raw interaction histories into optimized textual contexts, with recommendation accuracy as the training signal. This agent learns to filter noise, incorporate relevant metadata, and reorganize information to improve downstream predictions. Experiments on a large-scale industrial streaming dataset show that learned verbalization delivers up to 93% relative improvement in discovery item recommendation accuracy over template-based baselines. Further analysis reveals emergent strategies such as user interest summarization, noise removal, and syntax normalization, offering insights into effective context construction for LLM-based recommender systems."}

Genuinely solving such tasks requires Dec-POMDP reasoning, where agents use history to infer hidden states and coordinate based on local information. Yet it remains unclear whether popular benchmarks actually demand this reasoning or permit success via simpler strategies. We introduce a diagnostic suite combining statistically grounded performance comparisons and information-theoretic probes to audit the behavioural complexity of baseline policies (IPPO and MAPPO) across 37 scenarios spanning MPE, SMAX, Overcooked, Hanabi, and MaBrax. Our diagnostics reveal that success on these benchmarks rarely requires genuine Dec-POMDP reasoning. Reactive policies match the performance of memory-based agents in over half the scenarios, and emergent coordination frequently relies on brittle, synchronous action coupling rather than robust temporal influence. These findings suggest that some widely used benchmarks may not adequately test core Dec-POMDP assumptions under current training paradigms, potentially leading to over-optimistic assessments of progress. We release our diagnostic tooling to support more rigorous environment design and evaluation in cooperative MARL."}

The paper formalizes this principle through five system invariants with structured proof sketches, and implements it in PunkGo, a Rust sovereignty kernel that unifies RFC 6962 Merkle tree audit logs, capability-based isolation, energy-budget governance, and a human-approval mechanism.

In this paper, we demonstrate impossibility and hardness results of learning low-exploitable policies in general $n$-player Markov Games. We do so by providing examples where even exact measure matching fails, and demonstrating a new hardness result on characterizing the Nash gap given a fixed measure matching error. We then show how these challenges can be overcome using strategic dominance assumptions on the expert equilibrium.

To address these bottlenecks, we introduce QuantVLA, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that, to our knowledge, is the first PTQ approach for VLA systems and the first to successfully quantize a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head. QuantVLA incorporates three scale-calibrated components: (1) a selective quantization layout that integerizes all linear layers in both the language backbone and the DiT while keeping attention projections in floating point to preserve the original operator schedule; (2) attention temperature matching, a lightweight per-head scaling mechanism that stabilizes attention logits and is folded into the dequantization scales at inference; and (3) output head balancing, a per-layer residual interface calibration that mitigates post-projection energy drift. The framework requires no additional training, uses only a small unlabeled calibration buffer, and supports integer kernels for low-bit weights and activations while leaving the architecture unchanged. Across representative VLA models on LIBERO, QuantVLA exceeds the task success rates of full-precision baselines, achieves about 70% relative memory savings on the quantized components, and delivers a 1.22x speedup in end-to-end inference latency, providing a practical pathway toward scalable low-bit embodied intelligence under strict compute, memory, and power constraints."}

To address these limitations, we present NativeEmbodied, a challenging benchmark for VLM-driven embodied agents that uses a unified, native low-level action space. Built on diverse simulated scenes, NativeEmbodied includes three representative high-level tasks in complex scenarios to evaluate overall performance. For more detailed analysis, we further decouple the skills required by complex tasks and construct four types of low-level tasks, each targeting a fundamental embodied skill.

Existing evaluations have focused on how successful AI is at solving CTF challenges in isolation from human CTF players. As AI usage increases in both academic and industrial settings, it is equally likely that human players may collaborate with AI agents to solve challenges. This possibility exposes a key knowledge gap: how do humans perceive AI CTF assistance; when assistance is provided, how do they collaborate and is it effective with respect to human performance; how do humans assisted by AI compare to the performance of fully autonomous AI agents on the same challenges. We address this gap with the first empirical study of AI assistance in a live, onsite CTF. In a study with 41 participants, we qualitatively study (i) how participants' perception, trust, and expectations shift before versus after hands-on AI use, and (ii) how participants collaborate with an instrumented AI agent. Moreover, we also (iii) benchmark four autonomous AI agents on the same fresh challenge set to compare outcomes with human teams and analyze agent trajectories. We find that, as the competition progresses, teams increasingly delegate larger subtasks to the AI, giving it more agency. Interestingly, CTF challenges solving rates are often constrained not by model's reasoning capabilities, but rather by the human players: ineffective prompting and poor context specification become the primary bottleneck. Remarkably, autonomous agents that self-direct their prompting and tool use bypass this bottleneck and outperform most human teams, coming in second overall in the competition. We conclude with implications for the future design of CTF challenges and for building effective human-in-the-loop AI systems for security."}

We propose ICON, a probing-to-mitigation framework that neutralizes attacks while preserving task continuity. Our key insight is that IPI attacks leave distinct over-focusing signatures in the latent space. We introduce a Latent Space Trace Prober to detect attacks based on high intensity scores. Subsequently, a Mitigating Rectifier performs surgical attention steering that selectively manipulate adversarial query key dependencies while amplifying task relevant elements to restore the LLM's functional trajectory. Extensive evaluations on multiple backbones show that ICON achieves a competitive 0.4% ASR, matching commercial grade detectors, while yielding a over 50% task utility gain.

Later works in approximation theory provide quantitative approximation rates for ReLU networks on the class of $α$-Hölder functions $f: [0,1]^N \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The goal of this paper is to provide similar quantitative approximation results in the context of group equivariant learning, where the learned $α$-Hölder function is known to obey certain group symmetries. While there has been much interest in the literature in understanding the universal approximation properties of equivariant models, very few quantitative approximation results are known for equivariant models.\n  In this paper, we bridge this gap by deriving quantitative approximation rates for several prominent group-equivariant and invariant architectures. The architectures that we consider include: the permutation-invariant Deep Sets architecture; the permutation-equivariant Sumformer and Transformer architectures; joint invariance to permutations and rigid motions using invariant networks based on frame averaging; and general bi-Lipschitz invariant models. Overall, we show that equally-sized ReLU MLPs and equivariant architectures are equally expressive over equivariant functions. Thus, hard-coding equivariance does not result in a loss of expressivity or approximation power in these models."}

Considering the widespread technique of Shapley values, we find that purely data-driven operationalization of multivariate feature importance is unsuitable for such purposes. Even for simple problems with two features, spurious associations due to collider bias and suppression arise from considering one feature only in the observational context of the other, which can lead to misinterpretations. Causal knowledge about the data-generating process is required to identify and correct such misleading feature attributions. We propose cc-Shapley (causal context Shapley), an interventional modification of conventional observational Shapley values leveraging knowledge of the data's causal structure, thereby analyzing the relevance of a feature in the causal context of the remaining features. We show theoretically that this eradicates spurious association induced by collider bias. We compare the behavior of Shapley and cc-Shapley values on various, synthetic, and real-world datasets. We observe nullification or reversal of associations compared to univariate feature importance when moving from observational to cc-Shapley."}

Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art approach to solving inverse problems with a data-driven prior; however, directly computing the model evidence with respect to a diffusion prior is intractable.

We propose \\method, an estimator of the model evidence of a diffusion prior by integrating over the time-marginals of posterior sampling methods. Our method leverages the large amount of intermediate samples naturally obtained during the reverse diffusion sampling process to obtain an accurate estimation of the model evidence using only a handful of posterior samples (e.g., 20). We also demonstrate how to implement our estimator in tandem with recent diffusion posterior sampling methods. Empirically, our estimator matches the model evidence when it can be computed analytically, and it is able to both select the correct diffusion model prior and diagnose prior misfit under different highly ill-conditioned, non-linear inverse problems, including a real-world black hole imaging problem."}

Our key insight is that IPI attacks leave distinct over-focusing signatures in the latent space. We introduce a Latent Space Trace Prober to detect attacks based on high intensity scores. Subsequently, a Mitigating Rectifier performs surgical attention steering that selectively manipulate adversarial query key dependencies while amplifying task relevant elements to restore the LLM's functional trajectory. Extensive evaluations on multiple backbones show that ICON achieves a competitive 0.4% ASR, matching commercial grade detectors, while yielding a over 50% task utility gain.

However, most methods search within a discrete equation space, where the structural modifications of equations rarely align with their numerical behavior, leaving fitting error feedback too noisy to guide exploration. To address this challenge, we propose GenSR, a generative latent space-based SR framework following the `map construction -> coarse localization -> fine search'' paradigm. Specifically, GenSR first pretrains a dual-branch Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to reparameterize symbolic equations into a generative latent space with symbolic continuity and local numerical smoothness. This space can be regarded as a well-structured `map'' of the equation space, providing directional signals for search. At inference, the CVAE coarsely localizes the input data to promising regions in the latent space. Then, a modified CMA-ES refines the candidate region, leveraging smooth latent gradients. From a Bayesian perspective, GenSR reframes the SR task as maximizing the conditional distribution $p(\\mathrm{Equ.} \\mid \\mathrm{Num.})$, with CVAE training achieving this objective through the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). This new perspective provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of GenSR. Extensive experiments show that GenSR jointly optimizes predictive accuracy, expression simplicity, and computational efficiency, while remaining robust under noise."}

However, existing methods face a critical trade-off: conventional functional models are limited by linearity, whereas deep learning approaches lack interpretable region selection for sparse effects. To bridge these gaps, we propose a sparse Bayesian functional deep neural network (sBayFDNN). It learns adaptive functional embeddings through a deep Bayesian architecture to capture complex nonlinear relationships, while a structured prior enables interpretable, region-wise selection of influential domains with quantified uncertainty. Theoretically, we establish rigorous approximation error bounds, posterior consistency, and region selection consistency. These results provide the first theoretical guarantees for a Bayesian deep functional model, ensuring its reliability and statistical rigor. Empirically, comprehensive simulations and real-world studies confirm the effectiveness and superiority of sBayFDNN. Crucially, sBayFDNN excels in recognizing intricate dependencies for accurate predictions and more precisely identifies functionally meaningful regions, capabilities fundamentally beyond existing approaches."}

In this environment, a learner seeks to recover the mean $μ$ of a true distribution $P$ from a collection of sources that are both statistically heterogeneous and potentially malicious. We formalize this challenge through a double corruption landscape: an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of users are entirely adversarial, while the remaining ``good'' users provide data from distributions that are related to $P$, but deviate by a proximity parameter $α$.\n  Unlike existing work on the untrusted batch model, which typically measures this deviation via total variation distance in discrete settings, we address the continuous, high-dimensional regime under two natural variants for deviation: (1) good batches are drawn from distributions with a mean-shift of $\\sqrtα$, or (2) an $α$-fraction of samples within each good batch are adversarially corrupted. In particular, the second model presents significant new challenges: in high dimensions, unlike discrete settings, even a small fraction of sample-level corruption can shift empirical means and covariances arbitrarily.\n  We provide two Sum-of-Squares (SoS) based algorithms to navigate this tiered corruption. Our algorithms achieve the minimax-optimal error rate $O(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon/n} + \\sqrt{d/nN} + \\sqrtα)$, demonstrating that while heterogeneity $α$ represents an inherent statistical difficulty, the influence of adversarial users is suppressed by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{n}$ due to the internal averaging afforded by the batch structure."}

OpenPort defines authorization-dependent discovery, stable response envelopes with machine-actionable \\texttt{agent.*} reason codes, and an authorization model combining integration credentials, scoped permissions, and ABAC-style policy constraints. For write operations, OpenPort specifies a risk-gated lifecycle that defaults to draft creation and human review, supports time-bounded auto-execution under explicit policy, and enforces high-risk safeguards including preflight impact binding and idempotency. To address time-of-check/time-of-use drift in delayed approval flows, OpenPort also specifies an optional State Witness profile that revalidates execution-time preconditions and fails closed on state mismatch. Operationally, the protocol requires admission control (rate limits/quotas) with stable 429 semantics and structured audit events across allow/deny/fail paths so that client recovery and incident analysis are deterministic.

However, push-forward models are opaque as they lack the modularity of Bayes Theorem, leading to poor generalisation with respect to changes in the likelihood function. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to GAN architecture design by applying deep unfolding to Langevin MCMC algorithms. This paradigm maps fixed-step iterative algorithms onto modular neural networks, yielding architectures that are both flexible and amenable to interpretation.

Genuinely solving such tasks requires Dec-POMDP reasoning, where agents use history to infer hidden states and coordinate based on local information. Yet it remains unclear whether popular benchmarks actually demand this reasoning or permit success via simpler strategies. We introduce a diagnostic suite combining statistically grounded performance comparisons and information-theoretic probes to audit the behavioural complexity of baseline policies (IPPO and MAPPO) across 37 scenarios spanning MPE, SMAX, Overcooked, Hanabi, and MaBrax. Our diagnostics reveal that success on these benchmarks rarely requires genuine Dec-POMDP reasoning. Reactive policies match the performance of memory-based agents in over half the scenarios, and emergent coordination frequently relies on brittle, synchronous action coupling rather than robust temporal influence. These findings suggest that some widely used benchmarks may not adequately test core Dec-POMDP assumptions under current training paradigms, potentially leading to over-optimistic assessments of progress. We release our diagnostic tooling to support more rigorous environment design and evaluation in cooperative MARL."}

To address these challenges, we introduce PIME, an interpretable framework that bridges intrinsic interpretability with minimal-sufficient subgraph optimization by integrating prototype-based classification and consistency training with structural perturbations during learning. This encourages a structured latent space and enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) under a prototype-consistent objective to extract compact minimal-sufficient explanatory subgraphs post-training. Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that PIME achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by constraining the search space via learned prototypes, PIME identifies critical brain regions that are consistent with established neuroimaging findings. Stability analysis shows 90% reproducibility and consistent explanations across atlases."}

These capabilities are callable modules that package procedural knowledge with explicit applicability conditions, execution policies, termination criteria, and reusable interfaces. Unlike one-off plans or atomic tool calls, skills operate (and often do well) across tasks.\n  This paper maps the skill layer across the full lifecycle (discovery, practice, distillation, storage, composition, evaluation, and update) and introduces two complementary taxonomies. The first is a system-level set of \\textbf{seven design patterns} capturing how skills are packaged and executed in practice, from metadata-driven progressive disclosure and executable code skills to self-evolving libraries and marketplace distribution. The second is an orthogonal \\textbf{representation $\\times$ scope} taxonomy describing what skills \\emph{are} (natural language, code, policy, hybrid) and what environments they operate over (web, OS, software engineering, robotics).\n  We analyze the security and governance implications of skill-based agents, covering supply-chain risks, prompt injection via skill payloads, and trust-tiered execution, grounded by a case study of the ClawHavoc campaign in which nearly 1{,}200 malicious skills infiltrated a major agent marketplace, exfiltrating API keys, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser credentials at scale. We further survey deterministic evaluation approaches, anchored by recent benchmark evidence that curated skills can substantially improve agent success rates while self-generated skills may degrade them. We conclude with open challenges toward robust, verifiable, and certifiable skills for real-world autonomous agents."}

In FSSL, data heterogeneity is a challenging issue, which exists both across clients and within clients. External heterogeneity refers to the data distribution discrepancy across different clients, while internal heterogeneity represents the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data within clients. Most FSSL methods typically design fixed or dynamic parameter aggregation strategies to collect client knowledge on the server (external) and / or filter out low-confidence unlabeled samples to reduce mistakes in local client (internal). But, the former is hard to precisely fit the ideal global distribution via direct weights, and the latter results in fewer data participation into FL training. To this end, we propose a proxy-guided framework called ProxyFL that focuses on simultaneously mitigating external and internal heterogeneity via a unified proxy. I.e., we consider the learnable weights of classifier as proxy to simulate the category distribution both locally and globally. For external, we explicitly optimize global proxy against outliers instead of direct weights; for internal, we re-include the discarded samples into training by a positive-negative proxy pool to mitigate the impact of potentially-incorrect pseudo-labels. Insight experiments & theoretical analysis show our significant performance and convergence in FSSL."}

Although recent work explores various forms of reward shaping and step-level credit assignment, a key signal remains largely overlooked: the intrinsic uncertainty of LLMs. Uncertainty reflects model confidence, reveals where exploration is needed, and offers valuable learning cues even in failed trajectories. We introduce SELAUR: Self Evolving LLM Agent via Uncertainty-aware Rewards, a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates uncertainty directly into the reward design. SELAUR integrates entropy-, least-confidence-, and margin-based metrics into a combined token-level uncertainty estimate, providing dense confidence-aligned supervision, and employs a failure-aware reward reshaping mechanism that injects these uncertainty signals into step- and trajectory-level rewards to improve exploration efficiency and learning stability. Experiments on two benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, show that our method consistently improves success rates over strong baselines. Ablation studies further demonstrate how uncertainty signals enhance exploration and robustness."}

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations. We open source our code and provide pre-trained MIMIC agents and qualitative demos at: https://mimic-research.github.io."}

However, current evaluation benchmarks do not adequately assess their ability to solve real-world tasks that require synthesizing information from multiple sources and inferring insights beyond simple fact retrieval. To address this, we introduce DEEPSYNTH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agents on realistic, time-consuming problems that combine information gathering, synthesis, and structured reasoning to produce insights. DEEPSYNTH contains 120 tasks collected across 7 domains and data sources covering 67 countries. DEEPSYNTH is constructed using a multi-stage data collection pipeline that requires annotators to collect official data sources, create hypotheses, perform manual analysis, and design tasks with verifiable answers. When evaluated on DEEPSYNTH, 11 state-of-the-art LLMs and deep research agents achieve a maximum F1 score of 8.97 and 17.5 on the LLM-judge metric, underscoring the difficulty of the benchmark. Our analysis reveals that current agents struggle with hallucinations and reasoning over large information spaces, highlighting DEEPSYNTH as a crucial benchmark for guiding future research."}
