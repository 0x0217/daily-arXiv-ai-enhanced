L2M-AID orchestrates a team\nof collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to\nachieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a\nnovel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.\nResults demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,\ndeep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key\nmetrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by\nover 80% and improving response times by a factor of four.

A central open question is whether LLM agents, like\nreinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence\nthe behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the\nfirst investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS\nalgorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order\nderivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural\ncomponents that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce\nShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based\nagents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'\nlearning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate\nthat LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria\nin competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and\nChicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative\ngames (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).\nOur findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through\ninteraction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent\nLLM research."}

In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information.

Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to\neffectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information\nand make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when\nacting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two\ndomains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both\ndomains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and\ntask success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods."}

Offline RL offers a promising\navenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly\nreal-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly\ncomplex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and\nflow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either\nbackpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or\npolicy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability\nto larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to\ndevelop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or\nbackpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for\nOffline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that\nintegrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions.

At\ninference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection\nsampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient\noptimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.\nEmpirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of\noffline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value\nlearning into offline RL."}
