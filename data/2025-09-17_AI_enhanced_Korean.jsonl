Specifically, when studying the output of ABMs, the\nanalyst is often confronted with practical questions such as: (i) how many\nindependent replications should be run?

Existing underwater\ndiver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and\ncomplex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme\nthat utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and\nhigh-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic\nmultimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive\ncommunication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using\na multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative\nmovement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can\nbe achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment\nand wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to\ncoordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to\nadaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality\ncommunication between divers and surface platform can be achieved.

We introduce a run-wise certificate that\ncouples each node's key to the same exponential race that realizes leaf\nperturbations; the usual halting rule (stop when the maximum over $v$ in $F$ of\nKey$(v) \\le B^*$) then certifies the realized run. We give two certified modes\non context-indexed prefix DAGs with child partition: (i) Exact (known counts),\nusing lazy offset propagation with winner reuse; and (ii) Surrogate (upper\nbounds only), which anchors keys to a parent-level surrogate race and allows\nvalidator tightening via $\\kappa = \\log(N / N_{ub}$).

In FL, the task publisher (TP) releases tasks, and\nlocal model owners (LMOs) use their local data to train models. Sometimes, FL\nsuffers from the lack of training data, and thus workers are recruited for\ngathering data. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive incentive\nmechanism from a service-oriented perspective, with the objective of maximizing\nthe utilities of TP, LMOs and workers. Specifically, a Stackelberg game is\ntheoretically established between the LMOs and TP, positioning TP as the leader\nand the LMOs as followers. An analytical Nash equilibrium solution is derived\nto maximize their utilities. The interaction between LMOs and workers is\nformulated by a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), with the optimal\nstrategy identified via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Additionally, an\nAdaptively Searching the Optimal Strategy Algorithm (ASOSA) is designed to\nstabilize the strategies of each participant and solve the coupling problems.\nExtensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the\nproposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "LMO(\ub85c\uceec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc18c\uc720\uc790)\uc640 TP(\ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \uac8c\uc2dc\uc790) \uac04\uc758 Stackelberg \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, Nash \ud3c9\ud615 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec LMOs\uc640 TP\uc758 \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.

Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of\ncontrol over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent\nwork explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still\ndepend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets,\nlimiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in\nsynthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often\ngenomic rather than environmental perturbation.\n  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be\nguided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or\ncarefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by\nshowing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be\nguided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative\nprompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI\nmodel scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and\nthe former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.\n  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness\nfunctions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system\ngeneralizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language\nas a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written\nprompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired\nbehaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology\npartnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions,\nfixed rules, and domain-specific programming.", "AI":

As new\nthreats continue to emerge, it becomes critically necessary to assess the\nlandscape of LLMs' safety and security against evolving adversarial prompt\ntechniques. To understand the behavior of LLMs, this research provides an\nempirical analysis and risk profile of nine prominent LLMs, Claude Opus 4,\nDeepSeek V3 (both open-source and online), Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 3,\nLlama 4 Scout, Mistral 7B, and Qwen 3 1.7B, against 24 different security and\nsafety categories. These LLMs are evaluated on their ability to produce harmful\nresponses for adversarially crafted prompts (dataset has been made public) for\na broad range of safety and security topics, such as promotion of violent\ncriminal behavior, promotion of non-violent criminal activity, societal harms\nrelated to safety, illegal sexual content, dangerous code generation, and\ncybersecurity threats beyond code. Our study introduces the Risk Severity Index\n(RSI), an agile and scalable evaluation score, to quantify and compare the\nsecurity posture and creating a risk profile of LLMs. As the LLM development\nlandscape progresses, the RSI is intended to be a valuable metric for comparing\nthe risks of LLMs across evolving threats. This research finds widespread\nvulnerabilities in the safety filters of the LLMs tested and highlights the\nurgent need for stronger alignment, responsible deployment practices, and model\ngovernance, particularly for open-access and rapidly iterated models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub294 \ud070 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc740 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \ubc0f \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 9\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 LLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uacf5\uaca9\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 9\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 24\uac1c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud55c LLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ud544\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ucc3e\uc558\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc815\ub82c, \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \ubc30\uce58 \uad00\ud589 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM\uc758 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c\uc778 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \uc2ec\uac01\ub3c4 \uc9c0\uc218(RSI)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2c8\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uacfc \ucc29\ucde8\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc548\uc804, \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uacc4\uc18d\ud574\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c LLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c4\ub2e4.

This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving\nimage generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve\ngenerated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial\nprompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where\nspecialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify\nweaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide\ninterpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent\nwhile preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge\nfor head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing\nproblematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with\nuser intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models\ndemonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial\nprompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with\nmore advanced MLLM components.

Users often share sensitive information, such as their\nlocation, browsing history, and even financial data, within third-party apps\ninstalled on these devices, assuming a secure environment protected from\nmalicious actors. Recent research has revealed that malicious apps can exploit\nsuch capabilities and monitor benign apps to track user activities, leveraging\nfine-grained profiling tools, such as performance counter APIs. However,\napp-to-app monitoring is not feasible on all AR/VR devices (e.g., Meta Quest),\nas a concurrent standalone app execution is disabled. In this paper, we present\nOVRWatcher, a novel side-channel primitive for AR/VR devices that infers user\nactivities by monitoring low-resolution (1Hz) GPU usage via a background\nscript, unlike prior work that relies on high-resolution profiling. OVRWatcher\ncaptures correlations between GPU metrics and 3D object interactions under\nvarying speeds, distances, and rendering scenarios, without requiring\nconcurrent app execution, access to application data, or additional SDK\ninstallations. We demonstrate the efficacy of OVRWatcher in fingerprinting both\nstandalone AR/VR and WebXR applications. OVRWatcher also distinguishes virtual\nobjects, such as products in immersive shopping apps selected by real users and\nthe number of participants in virtual meetings, thereby revealing users'\nproduct preferences and potentially exposing confidential information from\nthose meetings.

We examine four critical agentic system dimensions:\norchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function\ncalling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark\nreveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the\nprevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems.

To appear at SOSP 2025. Code published at\n  https://github.com/CASP-Systems-BU/orq", "summary": "We present ORQ, a system that enables collaborative analysis of large private\ndatasets using cryptographically secure multi-party computation (MPC). ORQ\nprotects data against semi-honest or malicious parties and can efficiently\nevaluate relational queries with multi-way joins and aggregations that have\nbeen considered notoriously expensive under MPC. To do so, ORQ eliminates the\nquadratic cost of secure joins by leveraging the fact that, in practice, the\nstructure of many real queries allows us to join records and apply the\naggregations \"on the fly\" while keeping the result size bounded. On the system\nside, ORQ contributes generic oblivious operators, a data-parallel vectorized\nquery engine, a communication layer that amortizes MPC network costs, and a\ndataflow API for expressing relational analytics -- all built from the ground\nup.\n  We evaluate ORQ in LAN and WAN deployments on a diverse set of workloads,\nincluding complex queries with multiple joins and custom aggregations. When\ncompared to state-of-the-art solutions, ORQ significantly reduces MPC execution\ntimes and can process one order of magnitude larger datasets. For our most\nchallenging workload, the full TPC-H benchmark, we report results entirely\nunder MPC with Scale Factor 10 -- a scale that had previously been achieved\nonly with information leakage or the use of trusted third parties.", "AI": {"tldr": "ORQ \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ub2e4\uc790\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad00\uacc4 \ucffc\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc790\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uae30.", "method": "ORQ\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucffc\ub9ac \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548 \uc870\uc778\uc758 \uc81c\uacf1 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0, \ubc94\uc6a9 \ube44\uac00\uc2dc \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcd1\ub82c \ubca1\ud130\ud654 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc5d4\uc9c4 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ORQ\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 MPC \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ud6e8\uc52c \ud070 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "10\ubc30 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ud329\ud130\uc758 TPC-H \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c MPC \ud558\uc5d0 \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uace0\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804\uc5d0\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc774\ub098 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc81c3\uc790\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c\ub9cc \ub2ec\uc131\ub41c \uaddc\ubaa8\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc554\ud638\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ub2e4\uc790\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0(MPC)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 ORQ \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

Traditional pruning approaches often depend on\nhand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to\nsuboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework\ntransforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the\ntarget neural network that captures complete topological relationships between\nlayers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a\nglobal view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph\nrepresentation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action\nspace we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary\naction spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance\ncriteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions.\nThese contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process\n(CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while\nadhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we\ndesign a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform\nits previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on\nbenchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments\nshow that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques,\nshowing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning\nstrategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple\nweight magnitude considerations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AutoML \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504

Baulin"], "title": "Is the `Agent' Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation Intelligent Systems?", "comment": null, "summary": "The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nresearch, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary\napplications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper\ncritically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric\nparadigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent\nanthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish\nbetween agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g.,\nLLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems,\ncurrently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the\nimpression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant\nliterature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks,\nhighlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and\ngoal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems,\nwhile heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying\ncomputational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an\nalternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in\nsystem-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude\nthat investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex\nsystems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing\ntowards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general\nintelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental\nreconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the\nagent metaphor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

We introduce\nAgentic Lybic, a novel multi-agent system where the entire architecture\noperates as a finite-state machine (FSM). This core innovation enables dynamic\norchestration. Our system comprises four components: a Controller, a Manager,\nthree Workers (Technician for code-based operations, Operator for GUI\ninteractions, and Analyst for decision support), and an Evaluator. The critical\nmechanism is the FSM-based routing between these components, which provides\nflexibility and generalization by dynamically selecting the optimal execution\nstrategy for each subtask.

Despite extensive efforts to develop CAM detection tools, these\ntools typically rely on a limited set of predefined rules from human-curated\nknowledge. This rigid, rule-based approach hinders adaptation to evolving CAM\npatterns in real practices.\n  We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs), trained on publicly\navailable cryptography-related data, to automatically detect and classify CAMs\nin real-world code to address this limitation. Our method enables the\ndevelopment and continuous expansion of a CAM taxonomy, supporting developers\nand detection tools in tracking and understanding emerging CAM patterns.\nSpecifically, we develop an LLM-agnostic prompt engineering method to guide\nLLMs in detecting CAM instances from C/C++, Java, Python, and Go code, and then\nclassifying them into a hierarchical taxonomy.\n  Using a data set of 3,492 real-world software programs, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach with mainstream LLMs, including GPT, Llama,\nGemini, and Claude. It also allows us to quantitatively measure and compare the\nperformance of these LLMs in analyzing CAM in realistic code. Our evaluation\nproduced a taxonomy with 279 base CAM categories, 36 of which are not addressed\nby existing taxonomies. To validate its practical value, we encode 11 newly\nidentified CAM types into detection rules and integrate them into existing\ntools.

Existing MAD methods rely on\nmultiple rounds of interaction among agents to reach consensus, and the final\noutput is selected by majority voting in the last round. However, this\nconsensus-based design faces several limitations. First, multiple rounds of\ncommunication increases token overhead and limits scalability. Second, due to\nthe inherent conformity of LLMs, agents that initially produce correct\nresponses may be influenced by incorrect ones during the debate process,\ncausing error propagation. Third, majority voting introduces randomness and\nunfairness in the decision-making phase, and can degrade the reasoning\nperformance.\n  To address these issues, we propose \\textsc{Free-MAD}, a novel MAD framework\nthat eliminates the need for consensus among agents. \\textsc{Free-MAD}\nintroduces a novel score-based decision mechanism that evaluates the entire\ndebate trajectory rather than relying on the last round only. This mechanism\ntracks how each agent's reasoning evolves, enabling more accurate and fair\noutcomes.

By embedding Artificial Neural\nNetworks (ANNs) as local decision-making centers and interaction rules between\nlocalized agents, NCA can simulate processes across molecular, cellular,\ntissue, and system-level scales, offering a multiscale competency architecture\nperspective on evolution, development, regeneration, aging, morphogenesis, and\nrobotic control. These models not only reproduce biologically inspired target\npatterns but also generalize to novel conditions, demonstrating robustness to\nperturbations and the capacity for open-ended adaptation and reasoning. Given\ntheir immense success in recent developments, we here review current literature\nof NCAs that are relevant primarily for biological or bioengineering\napplications. Moreover, we emphasize that beyond biology, NCAs display robust\nand generalizing goal-directed dynamics without centralized control, e.g., in\ncontrolling or regenerating composite robotic morphologies or even on\ncutting-edge reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI-1. In addition, the same\nprinciples of iterative state-refinement is reminiscent to modern generative\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), such as probabilistic diffusion models. Their\ngoverning self-regulatory behavior is constraint to fully localized\ninteractions, yet their collective behavior scales into coordinated\nsystem-level outcomes. We thus argue that NCAs constitute a unifying\ncomputationally lean paradigm that not only bridges fundamental insights from\nmultiscale biology with modern generative AI, but have the potential to design\ntruly bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning\nand control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2e0\uacbd \uc138\ud3ec \uc790\ub3d9\uc790(NCA)\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801

The checklist addresses TON-specific challenges,\nsuch as asynchronous message handling, and provides actionable insights for\ndevelopers and auditors. We also present detailed case studies of\nvulnerabilities in TON smart contracts, highlighting their implications and\noffering lessons learned. By adopting this checklist, developers and auditors\ncan systematically identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, enhancing the\nsecurity and reliability of TON-based projects.

However, SOCs face persistent\nchallenges such as high alert volumes, limited resources, high demand for\nexperts with advanced knowledge, delayed response times, and difficulties in\nleveraging threat intelligence effectively. In this context, LLMs can offer\npromising solutions by automating log analysis, streamlining triage, improving\ndetection accuracy, and providing the required knowledge in less time.

MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder,\nand a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text\nembedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with\nbillions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only\nthousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on\ncomplex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on\nextensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup\nmethod that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly\nsupervised auxiliary tasks.

This introduces a fundamental challenge in establishing\ncomputational trust, specifically how one agent can verify that another's\noutput was genuinely produced by a claimed LLM, and not falsified or generated\nby a cheaper or inferior model. To address this challenge, this paper proposes\na verification framework that achieves tractable asymmetric effort, where the\ncost to verify a computation is substantially lower than the cost to perform\nit. Our approach is built upon the principle of deterministic replicability, a\nproperty inherent to autoregressive models that strictly necessitates a\ncomputationally homogeneous environment where all agents operate on identical\nhardware and software stacks. Within this defined context, our framework\nenables multiple validators to probabilistically audit small, random segments\nof an LLM's output and it distributes the verification workload effectively.\nThe simulations demonstrated that targeted verification can be over 12 times\nfaster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters to adjust the detection\nprobability.

Environments are not passive testing\ngrounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit\nvery challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous\ncapacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets\nhas led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the\nstructure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these\nenvironments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This\npaper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief\nstates of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This\nfoundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of\n\\emph{possibility} and \\emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal\nlogic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make\ninfere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for\nproper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively\nguide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from\nreaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity\nsimulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses\ncomplex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs\nwith the rigorous,

While these\nmethods have shown strong detection performance, they often struggle to sustain\nrobustness in real-world settings, particularly when facing code obfuscation\nand adversarial examples (AEs). Deep multimodal learning has emerged as a\npromising solution, leveraging the strengths of multiple feature types to\nenhance robustness and generalization. However, a systematic investigation of\nmultimodal fusion for both accuracy and resilience remains underexplored. In\nthis study, we propose DMLDroid, an Android malware detection based on\nmultimodal fusion that leverages three different representations of malware\nfeatures, including permissions & intents (tabular-based), DEX file\nrepresentations (image-based), and API calls (graph-derived sequence-based). We\nconduct exhaustive experiments independently on each feature, as well as in\ncombination, using different fusion strategies. Experimental results on the\nCICMalDroid 2020 dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach with the\ndynamic weighted fusion mechanism achieves high performance, reaching 97.98%\naccuracy and 98.67% F1-score on original malware detection. Notably, the\nproposed method maintains strong robustness, sustaining over 98% accuracy and\n98% F1-score under both obfuscation and adversarial attack scenarios.

The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar\nreward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This\nproblem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state\nrather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal\nis quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching\ntechniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our\nproposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same\nsparse reward signal as our method.

However, existing studies mainly utilize\nLLMs to rewrite and complete existing medical records, where the limitations in\ndata privacy, accuracy, and diversity sill exist, and additionally lack the\nability to interact like real patients. To address these issues, we propose a\nrealistic patient generation framework, Patient-Zero, which requires no real\nmedical records. Patient-Zero first introduces a medically-aligned multi-step\ngeneration architecture, which builds comprehensive patient records through\nhierarchical medical knowledge injection without real medical records. Then, to\noptimize the virtual patient's interaction abilities with humans, Patient-Zero\ndesigns a dynamic updating mechanism to improve the consistency and\nconversational performance.

Many recent studies assume the attacker to be a regular user who can\nonly upload a single trigger image, which is more realistic than earlier\nassumptions of website-level administrative control. However, these works still\nfall short of realism: (1) the trigger's position and surrounding context\nremain largely fixed between training and testing, failing to capture the\ndynamic nature of real webpages and (2) the trigger often occupies an\nunrealistically large area, whereas real-world images are typically small. To\nbetter reflect real-world scenarios, we introduce a more realistic threat model\nwhere the attacker is a regular user and the trigger image is small and\nembedded within a dynamically changing environment. As a result, existing\nattacks prove largely ineffective under this threat model.\n  To better expose the vulnerabilities of GUI agents, we propose Chameleon, an\nattack framework with two main novelties. The first is LLM-Driven Environment\nSimulation, which automatically generates diverse and high-fidelity webpage\nsimulations. The second is Attention Black Hole, which transforms attention\nweights into explicit supervisory signals that guide the agent's focus toward\nthe trigger region. We evaluate Chameleon on 6 realistic websites and 4\nrepresentative LVLM-powered GUI agents, where it significantly outperforms\nexisting methods. Ablation studies confirm that both novelties are critical to\nperformance.

Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured\ninformation (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and\nunstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this\nheterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine\nlearning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate\naccuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but\nstruggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present\n\\textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success\nprediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with\nunstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nstrategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for\nentrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\\% on\nCrunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional\nclassifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM\nprovides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing\ntransparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This\nwork demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and\nstructured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of\nentrepreneurial outcomes.

However, existing multi-agent frameworks\noften rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple\nqueries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the\nefficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a\ndynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM\nassignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three\ninterdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty\nestimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM\nrouter. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows,\nDAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO\noutperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency\nacross six benchmarks.

These works demonstrate that Rowhammer\ncan be mounted not only through native code, but also via remote code\nexecution, such as JavaScript in browsers, and over networks.\n  In this work, we uncover a previously unexplored Rowhammer vector. We present\nThunderhammer, an attack that induces DRAM bitflips from malicious peripherals\nconnected via PCIe or Thunderbolt (which tunnels PCIe). On modern DDR4 systems,\nwe observe that triggering bitflips through PCIe requests requires precisely\ntimed access patterns tailored to the target system. We design a custom device\nto reverse engineer critical architectural parameters that shape PCIe request\nscheduling, and to execute effective hammering access patterns. Leveraging this\nknowledge, we successfully demonstrate Rowhammer-induced bitflips in DDR4\nmemory modules via both PCIe slot connections and Thunderbolt ports tunnelling\nPCIe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Thunderhammer\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Rowhammer \uacf5\uaca9 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, PCIe \ub610\ub294 Thunderbolt\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc545\uc758\uc801 \uc8fc\ubcc0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c DRAM \ube44\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub9bd\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Rowhammer \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc561\uc138\uc2a4 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 PCIe \uc694\uccad\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c\ud558\ub294 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec PCIe \uc694\uccad \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc5ed\uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uba38\ub9c1 \uc811\uadfc \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uadfc DDR4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c PCIe \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub098\ub294 \ube44\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub9bd\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uba70, PCIe \uc2ac\ub86f \uc5f0\uacb0 \ubc0f Thunderbolt \ud3ec\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 Rowhammer \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Thunderhammer\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Rowhammer\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 Rowhammer\ub294 \ud559\uacc4\uc640 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544\uc654\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae30\uc220\uc740 2014\ub144\uc5d0 \ucc98\uc74c \ubc1c\ud45c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc778\uc811\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc758 \ube44\ud2b8\ub97c \ub4a4\uc9d1\ub294\ub2e4. \ubc1c\uacac \uc774\ud6c4, \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 Rowhammer\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\uaca9 \uc870\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc591\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Rowhammer\uac00 \ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c \ucf54\ub4dc\ubfd0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc6d0\uaca9 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc2e4\ud589, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800\uc758 JavaScript \ubc0f \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc218\ud589\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub358 Rowhammer \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ubc1d\ud788\uace0, PCIe \ub610\ub294 Thunderbolt(PCIe\ub97c \ud130\ub110\ub9c1\ud558\ub294)\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc545\uc758\uc801 \uc8fc\ubcc0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c DRAM \ube44\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub9bd\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc778 Thunderhammer\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc2e0 DDR4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c PCIe \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ube44\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub9bd \uc720\ub3c4\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ud328\ud134\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 PCIe \uc694\uccad \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc5ed\uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uba38\ub9c1 \uc811\uadfc \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 PCIe \uc2ac\ub86f \uc5f0\uacb0 \ubc0f PCIe\ub97c \ud130\ub110\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 Thunderbolt \ud3ec\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 DDR4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc5d0\uc11c Rowhammer\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ube44\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub9bd\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Berkay Celik", "Saurabh Bagchi"], "title": "MAUI: Reconstructing Private Client Data in Federated Transfer Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent works in federated learning (FL) have shown the utility of leveraging\ntransfer learning for balancing the benefits of FL and centralized learning. In\nthis setting, federated training happens after a stable point has been reached\nthrough conventional training. Global model weights are first centrally\npretrained by the server on a public dataset following which only the last few\nlinear layers (the classification head) of the model are finetuned across\nclients. In this scenario, existing data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) in FL\nshow two key weaknesses. First, strongly input-correlated gradient information\nfrom the initial model layers is never shared, significantly degrading\nreconstruction accuracy. Second, DRAs in which the server makes highly\nspecific, handcrafted manipulations to the model structure or parameters (for\ne.g., layers with all zero weights, identity mappings and rows with identical\nweight patterns) are easily detectable by an active client.\n  Improving on these, we propose MAUI, a stealthy DRA that does not require any\novert manipulations to the model architecture or weights, and relies solely on\nthe gradients of the classification head.

However, existing works on document\nautomation primarily focus on static media such as posters and slides, lacking\nmechanisms for personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal content\nsynchronization. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoAgent, a novel\nmulti-agent framework that synthesizes personalized scientific videos through a\nconversational interface.

Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and\nlimited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level\ncheck-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced\nGCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order\nmobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data\nsparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and\ncontinuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations,\nmitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer\nexplicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies\nwithout requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest.\nExperiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over\nclassical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method\nin accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative\ngains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with\na single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs\nenhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data.\nThis work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with\nsequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with\napplications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc775\uba85\ud654\ub41c \uc774\ub3d9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 GCN-TULHOR \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uc99d\ub300\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "TUL\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ucc9c, \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc704\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GCN-TULHOR\ub294 \uc721\uac01\ud615 \ud0c0\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc704\uce58 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uace0\ucc28 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud750\ub984 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4, \uc7ac\ud604\uc728, F1 \uc810\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc804\uc801 \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ubc0f RNN, Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uac04 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uac00\uce58\uc640 TUL\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacbd\ub85c-\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5f0\uacb0(TUL)\uc740 \uc775\uba85\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud574\ub2f9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc5f0\uad00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ucc9c, \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc704\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c \ub370\uc774\ud130, \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacf5\uac04 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \uccb4\ud06c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uacf5\uac04 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc704\uce58 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc721\uac01\ud615 \ud0c0\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ucc28 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud750\ub984 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70 \ub354 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 GCN-TULHOR \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c \uccb4\ud06c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc5f0\uc18d GPS \uacbd\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uace0\ucc28 \ud750\ub984 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Under revision\n  for resubmission to a machine learning venue", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in emulating\nhuman-like responses across a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel alignment framework that treats LLMs as agent proxies for human survey\nrespondents, affording a cost-effective and steerable solution to two pressing\nchallenges in the social sciences: the rising cost of survey deployment and the\ngrowing demographic imbalance in survey response data. Drawing inspiration from\nthe theory of revealed preference, we formulate alignment as a two-stage\nproblem: constructing diverse agent personas called endowments that simulate\nplausible respondent profiles, and selecting a representative subset to\napproximate a ground-truth population based on observed data. To implement the\nparadigm, we introduce P2P, a system that steers LLM agents toward\nrepresentative behavioral patterns using structured prompt engineering,\nentropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Unlike\npersonalization-heavy approaches, our alignment approach is\ndemographic-agnostic and relies only on aggregate survey results, offering\nbetter generalizability and parsimony. Beyond improving data efficiency in\nsocial science research, our framework offers a testbed for studying the\noperationalization of pluralistic alignment. We demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach on real-world opinion survey datasets, showing that our aligned agent\npopulations can reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and\nexhibit substantial response diversity, even without demographic conditioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744

Once the ICS is attacked, it may\ncause serious damage. Therefore, it is very important to detect anomalies in\nICSs. ICS can monitor and manage physical devices remotely using communication\nnetworks. The existing anomaly detection approaches mainly focus on analyzing\nthe security of network traffic or sensor data. However, the behaviors of\ndifferent domains (e.g., network traffic and sensor physical status) of ICSs\nare correlated, so it is difficult to comprehensively identify anomalies by\nanalyzing only a single domain. In this paper, an anomaly detection approach\nbased on cross-domain representation learning in ICSs is proposed, which can\nlearn the joint features of multi-domain behaviors and detect anomalies within\ndifferent domains. After constructing a cross-domain graph that can represent\nthe behaviors of multiple domains in ICSs, our approach can learn the joint\nfeatures of them by leveraging graph neural networks. Since anomalies behave\ndifferently in different domains, we leverage a multi-task learning approach to\nidentify anomalies in different domains separately and perform joint training.\nThe experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better\nthan existing approaches for identifying anomalies in ICSs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(ICS)\uc5d0\uc11c \uad50\ucc28 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uac00 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uad50\ucc28 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \uacfc\uc81c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 ICS \ub0b4 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad50\ucc28 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 ICS\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(ICS)\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uba70, \uadf8 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.

Traditional approaches to sensor\nselection often rely on linearized observability indices or statistical\ncorrelations that fail to capture the temporal evolution of complex systems. We\naddress this gap by leveraging liquid-time constant (LTC) networks,\ncontinuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants, to\nsystematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence\non state estimation. Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training\nan LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact\nthrough controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible\neffect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate\nthis approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical\ndomains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear\ncontinuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the\nstructure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added\ncomplexity. Results show that our causality-guided pruning consistently\nidentifies minimal sensor sets that align with underlying physics while\nimproving prediction accuracy. The framework automatically distinguishes\nessential physical measurements from noise and determines when derived\ninteraction terms provide complementary versus redundant information. Beyond\ncomputational efficiency, this approach enhances interpretability by grounding\nsensor selection decisions in dynamic causal relationships rather than static\ncorrelations, offering significant benefits for soft sensing applications\nacross process engineering, ecological monitoring, and agricultural domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc778\uacfc

Unfortunately, such attacks rely on trial and\nerror, lack generalizability across models, and are constrained by scalability\nand reliability.\n  This paper presents NeuroStrike, a novel and generalizable attack framework\nthat exploits a fundamental vulnerability introduced by alignment techniques:\nthe reliance on sparse, specialized safety neurons responsible for detecting\nand suppressing harmful inputs. We apply NeuroStrike to both white-box and\nblack-box settings: In the white-box setting, NeuroStrike identifies safety\nneurons through feedforward activation analysis and prunes them during\ninference to disable safety mechanisms. In the black-box setting, we propose\nthe first LLM profiling attack, which leverages safety neuron transferability\nby training adversarial prompt generators on open-weight surrogate models and\nthen deploying them against black-box and proprietary targets. We evaluate\nNeuroStrike on over 20 open-weight LLMs from major LLM developers. By removing\nless than 0.6% of neurons in targeted layers, NeuroStrike achieves an average\nattack success rate (ASR) of 76.9% using only vanilla malicious prompts.\nMoreover, Neurostrike generalizes to four multimodal LLMs with 100% ASR on\nunsafe image inputs. Safety neurons transfer effectively across architectures,\nraising ASR to 78.5% on 11 fine-tuned models and 77.7% on five distilled\nmodels. The black-box LLM profiling attack achieves an average ASR of 63.7%\nacross five black-box models, including the Google Gemini family.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroStrike\ub294alignment \uae30\uc220\uc758

This paper focuses\non comparing different distributed adversarial training algorithms--including\ncentralized and decentralized strategies--within multi-agent learning\nenvironments. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of model\nflatness in determining robustness. To this end, we develop a general\ntheoretical framework to study the escaping efficiency of these algorithms from\nlocal minima, which is closely related to the flatness of the resulting models.\nWe show that when the perturbation bound is sufficiently small (i.e., when the\nattack strength is relatively mild) and a large batch size is used,\ndecentralized adversarial training algorithms--including consensus and\ndiffusion--are guaranteed to escape faster from local minima than the\ncentralized strategy, thereby favoring flatter minima.

While the issue started to gain recognition, no adequate\nsolution has been proposed so far.\n  In this work, we propose a novel framework for time-limited continuous\nverification. The holder is able to individually configure the verification\nperiod when sharing information with the verifier, and the system guarantees\nproven untraceability of the revocation status after the verification period\nexpires. Different from existing systems, the implementation adopts a more\nscalable blacklist approach where tokens corresponding to revoked credentials\nare stored in the registry. The approach employs ZK proofs that allow holders\nto prove non-membership in the blacklist.

At each round, a forecaster is tasked with generating predictions\nfor an underlying (adaptively, adversarially chosen) state that are broadcast\nto a collection of downstream agents, who must each choose an action. Each of\nthe downstream agents has both a utility function mapping actions and state to\nutilities, and a vector-valued constraint function mapping actions and states\nto vector-valued costs. The utility and constraint functions can arbitrarily\ndiffer across downstream agents.

We show how to make a single\nset of predictions so that each of the downstream agents can guarantee this by\nacting as a simple function of the predictions, guaranteeing each of them\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(1)$ cumulative constraint violation.

However, these models are constrained by their training data,\nwhich is static and limited to information available up to a specific date.\nAdditionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning --\nwhether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform\nspecific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate\nsome of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data,\nenabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In\nindustrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing\ndecision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example,\nin manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost\nproductivity and support real-time decision-making.

In this\npaper, we present LOKI, a system designed to identify search engine queries\nlikely to return a high fraction of fraudulent websites. LOKI implements a\nkeyword scoring model grounded in Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI)\nand feature distillation from Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). We rigorously\nvalidate LOKI across 10 major scam categories and demonstrate a 20.58 times\nimprovement in discovery over both heuristic and data-driven baselines across\nall categories.

Our experiments demonstrate that these measures can\neffectively distinguish drifted from non-drifted scenarios, even under varying\nlevels of noise, providing a practical tool for drift detection in\nnon-stationary RL environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd \ub3d9\ud0dc\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uada4\uc801 \uac04\uc758 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc791\uc5c5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uce21\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uce21\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub41c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc640 \ube44\ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub41c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 (RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd \ub3d9\ud0dc\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc758\ub8cc, \ub85c\ubd07\uacf5\ud559 \ubc0f \uae08\uc735\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uc774 \ud655\ub960 \ub610\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \ubcc0\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uada4\uc801 \uac04\uc758 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc791\uc5c5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uce21\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uce21\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub41c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ube44\ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub41c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc640 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 RL \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Yet, most these\nsystems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of\nmanaging multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating\ncomplicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on\nadministration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large\nlanguage model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding\nand computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with\noperating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing\nagents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an\nabstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language\ninto machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a\nmore domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical\nguidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and\ncompliance. To address this need, we present \\textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified\nagent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract\nlayer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital\nhealthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam\nmanagement, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped\nas off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP,\nLinux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22\nspecialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically\nsound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and\nmedication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy\nand scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138

During each rollout process, we preserve the original\nmodel output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively\nrecovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture\nlong-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns\ninto the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level\nand episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance\n(SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a\npractical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that\nours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four\ndynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on\nAndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging\nthe gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent/tree/main/UI-S1.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(Semi-online Reinforcement Learning)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ucd94\ub860 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud604\uc5c5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubc18\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub9e4 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uba40\ud2f0 \ud134 \ub300\ud654 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc6d0\ub798 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uace0 \ud328\uce58 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uada4\uc801 \uac04\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c adaptively \ud68c\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc5d0 \ud560\uc778\ub41c \ubbf8\ub798 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubc18\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 7B \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911 4\uac1c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c SOTA \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub300\ube44 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc131\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ucd94\ub860 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294\ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uada4\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uada4\uc801 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4;

This survey defines the problem\nand organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct\nreasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and\nbranch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The\ntopology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including\ntraditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal\ninference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag\nset spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling,\ntool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment\nregimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each\ntopology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along\nwith curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and\ndeployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey).\nEvaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are\nhighlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty,\ngrounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and\ntreating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning\nstructures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against\ncomputational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely\ndepend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop\ntestbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and\nlong-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from\nnarrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only\nanalyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with

While quantum chemistry offers accurate insights into\nthese early-stage clusters, its steep computational costs limit large-scale\nexploration. In this work, we present a fast, interpretable, and surprisingly\npowerful alternative: $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$-NN) regression model. By\nleveraging chemically informed distance metrics, including a kernel-induced\nmetric and one learned via metric learning for kernel regression (MLKR), we\nshow that simple $k$-NN models can rival more complex kernel ridge regression\n(KRR) models in accuracy, while reducing computational time by orders of\nmagnitude. We perform this comparison with the well-established\nFaber-Christensen-Huang-Lilienfeld (FCHL19) molecular descriptor, but other\ndescriptors (e.g., FCHL18, MBDF, and CM) can be shown to have similar\nperformance. Applied to both simple organic molecules in the QM9 benchmark set\nand large datasets of atmospheric molecular clusters (sulphuric acid-water and\nsulphuric-multibase -base systems), our $k$-NN models achieve near-chemical\naccuracy, scale seamlessly to datasets with over 250,000 entries, and even\nappears to extrapolate to larger unseen clusters with minimal error (often\nnearing 1 kcal/mol).

Existing methods,\nhowever, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics,\nparticularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse\nbehaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling\nheterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global\ncontext, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each\nagent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and\ncomplex group-wise interactions (\\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or\npedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of\nagent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme\nand type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced,\ntype-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a\nprincipled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and\nexpressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset,\nHeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for\nkey metrics including Soft mAP and minADE.

However, IRL is\ninherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible\nset, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce\ndifferent policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional\ninformation, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the\n\"average\" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset\nof the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by\nplanning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a\nclosed-form expression.

Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only\nto train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average\nperformance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return\ndistribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the\nrisk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's\nreturn distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting\nand assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited\nexpressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and\nsufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it.\nBuilding on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC\nand RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and\nknown, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample\ncomplexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further\ndemonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the\nsetting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based\nvariant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and\nRS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and\nthe advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard

However, it remains a\nprevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and\nenvironmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of\naccommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and\ncomplex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency\nmatrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV)\nvalues to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather\nfactors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights\nand enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic\nstations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to\nadapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental\nconditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP)\nframework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target\ncoverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline\nmethods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then,\nvalidate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying\nMonte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under\nTest (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of\nthe VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying\nthe model's robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984

Although some multimodal\nreasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific\ndomains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall\nshort in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of\nmultimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare\nprofessionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through\na directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in\naccommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the\nreasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the\nbest recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at\ndifferent time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and\ndisease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning\nframework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to\nfurther enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and\nanalysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed\npreliminary approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc758\ub8cc \uc804\ubb38\uc778\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c1\uba74\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc720\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc5ed\ucd94\uc801\ud558\uace0 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\ubcf8 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uacfc \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud601\uc2e0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc815\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ubc30 \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \uac80\uc99d \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ub8cc\uc640 \uc758\ud559\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc57c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8 \uc751\uc6a9\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ub8cc \uc804\ubb38\uc778\ub4e4\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc720\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc5ed\ucd94\uc801\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc720\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc218\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\ub860 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uad8c\uc7a5 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774\ub098 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc0ad\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uac74\uac15 \ubc0f \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ubc30 \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \uac80\uc99d \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ucd08\uae30 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud601\uc2e0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We\npropose Hi-DARTS, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework\nthat addresses this trade-off. Hi-DARTS utilizes a meta-agent to analyze market\nvolatility and dynamically activate specialized Time Frame Agents for\nhigh-frequency or low-frequency trading as needed. During back-testing on AAPL\nstock from January 2024 to May 2025, Hi-DARTS yielded a cumulative return of\n25.17% with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.75. This performance surpasses standard\nbenchmarks, including a passive buy-and-hold strategy on AAPL (12.19% return)\nand the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) (20.01% return).

Across symbolic,\naudio, and graph-theoretic analyses, the swarm yields superior quality while\ndelivering greater diversity and structural variety and leads across creativity\nmetrics. The dynamics contract toward a stable configuration of complementary\nroles, and self-similarity networks reveal a small-world architecture with\nefficient long-range connectivity and specialized bridging motifs, clarifying\nhow local novelties consolidate into global musical form.

Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical\nrepresentation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches\nfrom Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological\nproperties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images,\nwhich can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning\ntechnologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for\nlearning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of\nnonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear\nmanner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and\nreal-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean\nsquared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior\ngeneralization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical\nrepresentations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit\nexceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of

This paper presents a systematic review of Human-AI collaboration\npatterns that support decision-making across all disaster management phases.\nDrawing from 51 peer-reviewed studies, we identify four major categories:\nHuman-AI Decision Support Systems, Task and Resource Coordination, Trust and\nTransparency, and Simulation and Training. Within these, we analyze\nsub-patterns such as cognitive-augmented intelligence, multi-agent\ncoordination, explainable AI, and virtual training environments. Our review\nhighlights how AI systems may enhance situational awareness, improves response\nefficiency, and support complex decision-making, while also surfacing critical\nlimitations in scalability, interpretability, and system interoperability.

While being straightforward, this approach does not account for\nthe updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in\nmiscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient\n(KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated\npolicies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated\npolicies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves\nmonotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We\nprovide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL\nalgorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior\nperformance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent\nMuJoCo.", "AI": {"tldr": "KPG \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825 \uc815\ucc45 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uad6d\uc18c \ub0b4\uc26c \uade0\ud615\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \ubbf8\uc2a4\ucf54\ub514\ub124\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "$K$-Level Policy Gradient (KPG) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "KPG\ub294 \uc720\ud55c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc815 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0 \uad6d\uc18c \ub0b4\uc26c \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc870 \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KPG\ub97c MAPPO, MADDPG, FACMAC\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2ec\uce35 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud06c\ub798\ud504\ud2b8 II \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 MuJoCo\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae4a\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub294 $K$-Level Policy Gradient (KPG) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc720\ud55c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc5d0\uc11c KPG\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6d\uc18c \ub0b4\uc26c \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc870 \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 KPG\ub97c \uae4a\uc740 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 MAPPO, MADDPG \ubc0f FACMAC\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud06c\ub798\ud504\ud2b8 II \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 MuJoCo\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae4a\uc740 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
