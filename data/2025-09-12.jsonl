Critical to this\nsuccess are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens\nbased on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel\nframework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal\nstructures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of\ninduction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and\nlearn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal\nstructure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the\nrelationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our\nframework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with\ndifferent lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting\nunveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows\ntransformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure\nin-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism\nto predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the\ncorresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a\n3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a\ntheoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to\nthe maximum likelihood solution.

In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following\ntasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context\nmemory and task executions conditioned on the query results.

We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning\nRepresentation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that\nincorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and\nclinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During\npretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that\nshare similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are\ndissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological\nsimilarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically\nmeaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific\naugmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a\nhybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.\nResults: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,\nfor multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for\nbinary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,\nPhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,\nunderscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding\nphysiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model\nto learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:\nPhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a\npromising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics."}

Homomorphic\nencryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.\nHowever, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and\nsampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under\nencryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,\nan HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to\nprior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also\npropose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging\ncutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both\ntechniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving\nsettings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based\nsequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through\nestimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,\nproving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of\nthe input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid\nconvergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show\nlatency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation."}

This paper provides a\ncomprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic\ndesign that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore\nthe foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the\nPlanner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability,\ncost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct\n(Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this\ndesign, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection\nattacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E\nprovides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we\ndetail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least\nPrivilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these\nprinciples actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints\nand working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain\n(via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing\nthe P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's\nstateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for\nsecurity, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss\nadvanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with\nDirected Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop\n(HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects,\ndevelopers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient,\nand trustworthy LLM agents."}

Like\nhuman cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and\nskills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite\nadvances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --\nwithout relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic\nenvironments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The\nframework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high\nflexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world\nscenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose\nScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation\nbalance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation\nby restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards\nexploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving\nstrategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on\n27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will\nopen-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets\n-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of\nintelligent agents."}

To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a\nweb-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations.

Results demonstrate that increasing AI\ninvolvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI\nagent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to\nachieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their\nsignificantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001).
