In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when\ncomposed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover\nsensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We\npresent the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and\npossible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a\nframework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly\namplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to\nmitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1)\nTheory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent\nby anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2)\nCollaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate\nwith peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive\ninformation spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions\nthat expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign\ninferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in\nbalancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought\nalone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our\nToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can\nreduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the\nhighest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining\nexplicit reasoning with defender collaboration. Together, our results expose a\nnew class of risks in collaborative LLM deployments and provide actionable\ninsights for designing safeguards against compositional, context-driven privacy\nleakage."}

With human-like\ncapabilities, LLMs have been used to simulate humans and serve as AI assistants\nacross many applications. As a result, great concern has arisen about whether\nand under what circumstances LLMs think and behave like real human agents.\nRationality is among the most important concepts in assessing human behavior,\nboth in thinking (i.e., theoretical rationality) and in taking action (i.e.,\npractical rationality). In this work, we propose the first benchmark for\nevaluating the omnibus rationality of LLMs, covering a wide range of domains\nand LLMs. The benchmark includes an easy-to-use toolkit, extensive experimental\nresults, and analysis that illuminates where LLMs converge and diverge from\nidealized human rationality. We believe the benchmark can serve as a\nfoundational tool for both developers and users of LLMs."}

For a particular signal decay, the process\nfor ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed\nanalysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic\noverlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the\nsimulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process\ntypically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic\nmethod exists.\n  This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective,\nwe present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to\novercome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the\ncritical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty\nhadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is\nbroadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from\na Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits\nthe synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with\nhighly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs\nto efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful\ntrajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training.

However, existing\nmethods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent\ncharacteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among\nagents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive\nDiversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that\nincorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage\npolicy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing\ninspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of\nmoderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we\ndesign an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce\ncompetitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and\ndistributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance\nbetween competition and cooperation. By optimizing the parameterized\ncentralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the\nconstrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task\nobjectives. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods in the\nSMAC and GRF environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDiCon\nachieves superior performance, with competitive intrinsic rewards effectively\npromoting diverse and adaptive strategies among cooperative agents."}

In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when\ncomposed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover\nsensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We\npresent the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and\npossible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a\nframework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly\namplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to\nmitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1)\nTheory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent\nby anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2)\nCollaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate\nwith peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive\ninformation spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions\nthat expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign\ninferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in\nbalancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought\nalone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our\nToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can\nreduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the\nhighest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining\nexplicit reasoning with defender collaboration.

These risks are\nexacerbated when LLMs are combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\npipelines that dynamically fetch contextual documents at inference time.\n  We demonstrate data exfiltration attacks on AI assistants where adversaries\ncan exploit current fine-tuning and RAG architectures to leak sensitive\ninformation by leveraging the lack of access control enforcement.
