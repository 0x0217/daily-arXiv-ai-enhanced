This paper proposes a hybrid meta heuristic approach combining a\nGenetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to address the\nchallenges of energy efficient and reliable node deployment. The GA PSO hybrid\nleverages GAs strong exploration capabilities and PSOs rapid convergence,\nachieving an optimum stability between coverage and energy consumption. The\nperformance of the proposed approach is evaluated against GA and PSO alone and\nthe innovatory meta heuristic based Competitive Multi Objective Marine\nPredators Algorithm (CMOMPA) across varying sensing ranges. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that GA PSO requires 15% to 25% fewer sensor nodes and maintains\n95% or more area coverage while maintaining the connectivity in comparison to\nstandalone GA or PSO algorithm. The proposed algorithm also dominates CMOMPA\nwhen compared for long sensing and communication range in terms of higher\ncoverage, improved connectivity, and reduced deployment time while requiring\nfewer sensor nodes. This study also explores key trade offs in WSN deployment\nand highlights future research directions, including heterogeneous node\ndeployment, mobile WSNs, and enhanced multi objective optimization techniques.\nThe findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid meta heuristics in\nimproving WSN performance, offering a promising approach for real world\napplications such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, smart agriculture,\ndisaster response, and IIoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc720\uc120 \uc13c\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub178\ub4dc \ubc30\uce58\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc720\uc804 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uc785\uc790 \uad70\uc9d1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uba54\ud0c0 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ub178\ub4dc \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc720\uc120 \uc13c\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub178\ub4dc \ubc30\uce58 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0, \ub178\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc720\uc804 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998(GA)\uacfc \uc785\uc790 \uad70\uc9d1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(PSO)\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uba54\ud0c0 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 GA \ubc0f PSO \ub2e8\ub3c5\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc13c\uc11c \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c 15%\uc5d0\uc11c 25% \ub354 \uc801\uac8c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uba70 95% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uba54\ud0c0 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc774 WSN \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ud658\uacbd \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1, \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud2f0, \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ub18d\uc5c5, \uc7ac\ub09c \ub300\uc751 \ubc0f IIoT\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc120 \uc13c\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub178\ub4dc \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0, \ub178\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub178\ub4dc \ubc30\uce58\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc720\uc804 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998(GA)\uacfc \uc785\uc790 \uad70\uc9d1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(PSO)\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uba54\ud0c0 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This perspective examines the strategic value of passive\nhack-back techniques that enable covert attribution and intelligence collection\nwithout initiating direct offensive actions. Key vectors include tracking\nbeacons, honeytokens, environment-specific payloads, and supply-chain-based\ntraps embedded within exfiltrated or leaked assets. These approaches rely on\nthe assumption that attackers will interact with compromised data in traceable\nways, allowing defenders to gather signals without violating engagement\npolicies. The paper also explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in\nenhancing passive hack-back operations. Topics include the deployment of\nautonomous agents for forensic reconnaissance, the use of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to generate dynamic payloads, and Adversarial Machine Learning (AML)\ntechniques for evasion and counter-deception. A dedicated section discusses the\nimplications of quantum technologies in this context, both as future threats to\ncryptographic telemetry and as potential tools for stealthy communication and\npost-quantum resilience. Finally, the paper advocates for hybrid defensive\nframeworks that combine passive attribution with delayed or conditional active\nresponses, while maintaining compliance with legal, ethical, and

Working Paper - Version 1.0. Submitted\n  under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license. Also available as an SSRN Working Paper.\n  Feedback and collaboration are welcome", "summary": "Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has become a widely adopted model for securing\nenterprise environments, promoting continuous verification and minimal trust\nacross systems. However, its application in mobile contexts remains limited,\ndespite mobile applications now accounting for most global digital interactions\nand being increasingly targeted by sophisticated threats. Existing Zero Trust\nframeworks developed by organisations such as the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA) primarily focus on enterprise-managed infrastructure,\nassuming organisational control over devices, networks, and identities. This\npaper addresses a critical gap by proposing an extended Zero Trust model\ndesigned for mobile applications operating in untrusted, user-controlled\nenvironments. Using a design science methodology, the study introduced a\nsix-pillar framework that supports runtime enforcement of trust through\ncontrols including device integrity, user identity validation, data protection,\nsecure application programming interface (API) usage, behavioural monitoring,\nand live application protection. Each pillar was mapped to relevant regulatory\nand security standards to support compliance. A phased implementation roadmap\nand maturity assessment model were also developed to guide adoption across\nvarying organisational contexts. The proposed model offers a practical and\nstandards-aligned approach to securing mobile applications beyond\npre-deployment controls, aligning real-time enforcement with Zero Trust\nprinciples. This contribution expands the operational boundaries of ZTA and\nprovides organisations with a deployable path to reduce fraud, enhance\ncompliance, and address emerging mobile security challenges. Future research\nmay include empirical validation of the framework and cross-sector application\ntesting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc704\ud55c

While recent advances in deep learning have\npushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based\napproaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and\ntransparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of\nrule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple\ncorpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced\nrule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level\nacoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach\nachieves competitive performance while maintaining complete\ninterpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based\nsystems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and\nprovide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show\nhow these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning\npipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap\nbetween traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our\nanalysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher\naccuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages\nin clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and\nreal-time feedback are essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc801\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc

This paper presents a\nnovel framework that considers both adversarial factors, building resilience\ninto a heterogeneous network (HetNet) integrating Low Earth Orbit (LEO)\nsatellite constellation with High-Altitude Platform Ground Stations (HAPGS) and\nLow-Altitude Platforms (LAPS), tailored to support wildfire management\noperations. Building upon our previous work on secure-by-component approach for\nlink segment security, we extend protection to the communication layer by\nsecuring both Radio Frequency (RF)/Free Space Optics (FSO) management and\ndifferent links. Through a case study, we quantify how environmental stressors\nimpact secrecy capacity and expose the system to passive adversaries. Key\nfindings demonstrate that atmospheric attenuation and beam misalignment can\nnotably degrade secrecy capacity across both short- and long-range\ncommunication links, while high-altitude eavesdroppers face less signal\ndegradation, increasing their interception capability. Moreover, increasing\ntransmit power to counter environmental losses can inadvertently improve\neavesdropper reception, thereby reducing overall link confidentiality. Our work\nnot only highlights the importance of protecting networks from these dual\nthreats but also aligns with the IEEE P3536 Standard for Space System\nCybersecurity Design, ensuring resilience and the prevention of mission\nfailures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0b0\ubd88 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc800\uc9c0\uad6c \uada4\ub3c4 \uc704\uc131 \uad70\uc9d1\uacfc \uace0\uace0\ub3c4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc9c0\uc0c1\uad6d \ubc0f \uc800\uace0\ub3c4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc774\uc885 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud658\uacbd\uc801 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ube44\ubc00 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ub2e8\uae30 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub9c1\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uadf8\ub110 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubcf4\ud638\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, IEEE P3536 \ud45c\uc900\uc5d0 \ubd80\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd88\ub9ac\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uc870\uac74\uacfc \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0b0\ubd88 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc800\uc9c0\uad6c \uada4\ub3c4 \uc704\uc131 \uad70\uc9d1\uacfc \uace0\uace0\ub3c4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc9c0\uc0c1\uad6d(HAPGS), \uc800\uace0\ub3c4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc(LAPS)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(HetNet)\uc5d0 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0b0\ubd88 \uad00\ub9ac \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9de\ucda4\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c1\ud06c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \ubb34\uc120 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218(RF)/\uc790\uc720 \uacf5\uac04 \uad11\ud559(FSO) \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uacc4\uce35\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud658\uacbd\uc801 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ube44\ubc00 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801 \uc801\ub300\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ub178\ucd9c\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ub300\uae30 \uac10\uc1e0\uc640 \ube54 \ubbf8\uc870\uc815\uc774 \ub2e8\uae30 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub9c1\ud06c \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ubc00 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uace0\uace0\ub3c4 \uc5ff\ub4e3\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uc2e0\ud638 \uac10\uc1e0\uac00 \uc801\uc5b4 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uac00\ub85c\ucc44\uae30 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud658\uacbd\uc801 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\uc1a1 \uc804\ub825\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74 \uc6b0\uc5f0\ud788 \uc5ff\ub4e3\ub294 \uc774\uc758 \uc218\uc2e0\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \ub9c1\ud06c\uc758 \uae30\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc784\ubb34 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc608\ubc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 IEEE P3536 \uc6b0\uc8fc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc124\uacc4 \ud45c\uc900\uc5d0 \ubd80\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This study applies\nexplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to\npredict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries\n(67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),\nRandom Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using\nstudent, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data\n(with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country.\nPerformance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure\ninterpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree\nvisualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR,\nwith RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included\nsocio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes\ntoward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual\ndiagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and\nCATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the\nnon-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in\neducational research.

While recent advances in deep learning have\nsignificantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of\nexplainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust\nand transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on\nattention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack\nsystematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale\ndatasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate\nrationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding\nthrough two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations\nreflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how\nconsistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the\nevaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,\noffering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with\ncurrent clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of\nrationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of\nLLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale\nlearning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where\nrationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used\nas distant supervision signals.

While\neffective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical\nlimitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to\ndegraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited\ninter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt\nconcatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information\nloss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS\nbuilt on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol.\nUnlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent\ncollaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results,\nidentify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm\nreduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and\nminimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable and\ncost-efficient execution.

However, these approaches primarily focus on promoting cooperation by\nmanaging the trade-off between individual and collective returns, without\nexplicitly addressing fairness with respect to the agents' task-specific\nrewards. In this paper, we propose an adaptive conflict-aware gradient\nadjustment method that promotes cooperation while ensuring fairness in\nindividual rewards. The proposed method dynamically balances policy gradients\nderived from individual and collective objectives in situations where the two\nobjectives are in conflict. By explicitly resolving such conflicts, our method\nimproves collective performance while preserving fairness across agents.

With this aging mechanism, the\nrate of device aging is dependent not only on overall operating conditions,\nsuch as heat, but also on user controllable inputs to the transistors. This\ndependence on input implies a possible timing fault-injection attack wherein a\ntargeted path of logic is intentionally degraded through the purposeful,\nsoftware-driven actions of an attacker, rendering a targeted bit effectively\nstuck.\n  In this work, we describe such an attack mechanism, which we dub a\n\"$\\textbf{Targeted Wearout Attack}$\", wherein an attacker with sufficient\nknowledge of the processor core, executing a carefully crafted software program\nwith only user privilege, is able to degrade a functional unit within the\nprocessor with the aim of eliciting a particular desired incorrect calculation\nin a victim application.

These\npipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency\nand raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model\nidentification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model\noutputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that\nuses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First\n(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an\nincoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow\n(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)\nstagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a\nstagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each\nstage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow\nwith clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on\nspecialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream\ntasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying\ndeployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,\nour single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.\n  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach\nshows that one VLM can both decide and do.

However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate\nstable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex\ninteractions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a\ncomputational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates\ngenerative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to\ninvestigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation\nemerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that\nagents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and\ndisplay distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse\nstrategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively\ndismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct\nself-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings\nsuggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social\nstructures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective\ncognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and\ninteractional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights\nprovide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group\nsocial dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

However, the issues of fraud associated with them have also become\nincreasingly prominent. As reported in user reviews from mobile app markets,\nmany users have complained about experiencing red packet fraud and being\npersistently troubled by fraudulent red packets. To uncover this phenomenon, we\nconduct the first investigation into an extensive collection of user reviews on\napps with red packets. In this paper, we first propose a novel automated\napproach, ReckDetector, for effectively identifying apps with red packets from\napp markets. We then collect over 360,000 real user reviews from 334 apps with\nred packets available on Google Play and three popular alternative Android app\nmarkets. We preprocess the user reviews to extract those related to red packets\nand fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model to identify negative reviews. Finally,\nbased on semantic analysis, we have summarized six distinct categories of red\npacket fraud issues reported by users. Through our study, we found that red\npacket fraud is highly prevalent, significantly impacting user experience and\ndamaging the reputation of apps. Moreover, red packets have been widely\nexploited by unscrupulous app developers as a deceptive incentive mechanism to\nentice users into completing their designated tasks, thereby maximizing their\nprofits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0\uc758 \ubcf4\uae09\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc571\uc5d0\uc11c \ube68\uac04 \ubd09\ud22c\uac00 \ub110\ub9ac

Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by\nmeasuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric\ncharacterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in\nscenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian\nframework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when\npresented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and\nirrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In\ncomparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive\nbehavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not\nhave a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination\nof open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing\nsycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability\njudgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause\ndeviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian\nerror. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)\nprobing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted\nposterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in\nincreased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases\nerror, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly\ncorrelated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on\nground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to\nsycophancy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615

The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such\nas processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However,\nthey provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their\nconclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world\ntrust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards\nevaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning\nprocess by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify\nmodel answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to\nobtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts,\nquestions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a\nmethod that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves\nattribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced\nattribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an\naverage BERTScore of $\\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth\nresponses.

Conventional UAV communication systems often\nexpose flight path data to third parties, making them vulnerable to tracking,\nsurveillance, and location inference attacks. Existing encryption techniques\nprovide security but fail to ensure complete privacy, as adversaries can still\ninfer movement patterns through metadata analysis. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a zk-SNARK(Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of\nKnowledge)-based privacy-preserving flight path authentication and verification\nframework. Our approach ensures that a UAV can prove its authorisation,\nvalidate its flight path with a control centre, and comply with regulatory\nconstraints without revealing any sensitive trajectory information. By\nleveraging zk-SNARKs, the UAV can generate cryptographic proofs that verify\ncompliance with predefined flight policies while keeping the exact path and\nlocation undisclosed. This method mitigates risks associated with real-time\ntracking, identity exposure, and unauthorised interception, thereby enhancing\nUAV operational security in adversarial environments. Our proposed solution\nbalances privacy, security, and computational efficiency, making it suitable\nfor resource-constrained UAVs in both civilian and military applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV)\uc758 \ube44\ud589 \uacbd\ub85c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c zk-SNARK \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uc99d \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "UAV\uc758 \uad70\uc0ac, \uc0c1\uc5c5 \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub958 \uc801\uc6a9\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \ube44\ud589 \uacbd\ub85c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "zk-SNARK \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ube44\ud589 \uacbd\ub85c \uc778\uc99d \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 UAV\uc758 \uad8c\ud55c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0 \ube44\ud589 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 UAV\uac00 \uc815\ud574\uc9c4 \ube44\ud589 \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc554\ud638\uc801 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\uc801, \uc2e0\uc6d0 \ub178\ucd9c, \ubb34\ub2e8 \uac00\ub85c\ucc44\uae30\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc, \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c UAV\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV)\uc758 \uad70\uc0ac, \uc0c1\uc5c5 \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub958 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \ube44\ud589 \uacbd\ub85c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ubd88\ub7ec\uc77c\uc73c\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 UAV \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ube44\ud589 \uacbd\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc81c3\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ub178\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uc801, \uac10\uc2dc \ubc0f \uc704\uce58 \ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\uc774 \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 zk-SNARK(Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638 \ube44\ud589 \uacbd\ub85c \uc778\uc99d \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 UAV\uac00 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uad8c\ud55c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uad00\uc81c \uc13c\ud130\uc640 \ube44\ud589 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uaddc\uc81c \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. zk-SNARK\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 UAV\ub294 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ube44\ud589 \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc554\ud638\uc801 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \uc704\uce58\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\uc801, \uc2e0\uc6d0 \ub178\ucd9c \ubc0f \ubb34\ub2e8 \uac00\ub85c\ucc44\uae30\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c UAV \uc6b4\uc601 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc81c\uc548 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc, \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ubbfc\uac04 \ubc0f \uad70\uc0ac \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d UAV\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While the expressiveness\nof general infinite AFs make them a tempting tool for modeling many kinds of\nreasoning scenarios, the computational intractability of solving infinite AFs\nlimit their use, even in many theoretical applications.\n  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite\nbut finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each\nargument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a\nsurprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary\ndoes not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the\nadmissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint\nwhich entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.\n  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs\nprovide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals\nof being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being\ncomputationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be\nuseful.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc720\ud55c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubb34\ud55c\ud55c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uacfc\ud559 \ubc0f \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb34\ud55c\ud55c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0c1\ucda9\ub418\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc720\ud55c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubb34\ud55c\ud55c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc720\ud55c\ud568\uc758 \uac00\uc815\uc774 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc218\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc870\ud569\ub860\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5b4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \ubb34\ud55c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uac16\ucd94\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud07c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd94\uc0c1 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(AFs)\ub294 \uc0c1\ucda9\ub418\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubb34\ud55c AF\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc885\ub958\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubb34\ud55c AF\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc \ub9ce\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc774 \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ub4e4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574\uc11c\ub9cc \uacf5\uaca9\ubc1b\ub294 \ubb34\ud55c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \uc8fc\uc7a5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc720\ud55c\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac00\uc815\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc218\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \uadf9\uc801\uc778 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \uc870\ud569\ub860\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \ubb34\ud55c AF\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \ub9cc\ud07c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud07c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uacb0\ub860\uc9c0\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, due to the inherent characteristics of audio signals,\nwatermark localization and resistance to desynchronization attacks remain\nsignificant challenges. In this paper, we propose a learning-based scheme named\nSyncGuard to address these challenges. Specifically, we design a frame-wise\nbroadcast embedding strategy to embed the watermark in arbitrary-length audio,\nenhancing time-independence and eliminating the need for localization during\nwatermark extraction. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a\nmeticulously designed distortion layer. Additionally, we employ dilated\nresidual blocks in conjunction with dilated gated blocks to effectively capture\nmulti-resolution time-frequency features.

Due to its NP-hard nature, exact\nsolvers become impractical under the assumption that $P \\ne NP$. As a result,\nlearning-based approaches have gained traction for their ability to rapidly\ngenerate high-quality approximate solutions. Among these, two-stage methods\ncombine learning-based components with classical solvers, simplifying the\nlearning objective. However, this decoupling often disrupts consistent\noptimization, potentially degrading solution quality. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel two-stage framework named \\textbf{Generate-and-Split} (GaS),\nwhich integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with an optimal splitting\nalgorithm in a joint training process.

While prior work has examined prompt-based attacks\n(e.g., prompt injection) and data-oriented threats (e.g., data exfiltration),\ntime-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) remain largely unexplored in this\ncontext. TOCTOU arises when an agent validates external state (e.g., a file or\nAPI response) that is later modified before use, enabling practical attacks\nsuch as malicious configuration swaps or payload injection. In this work, we\npresent the first study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM-enabled agents. We\nintroduce TOCTOU-Bench, a benchmark with 66 realistic user tasks designed to\nevaluate this class of vulnerabilities. As countermeasures, we adapt detection\nand mitigation techniques from systems security to this setting and propose\nprompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, and tool-fusing. Our study\nhighlights challenges unique to agentic workflows, where we achieve up to 25%\ndetection accuracy using automated detection methods, a 3% decrease in\nvulnerable plan generation, and a 95% reduction in the attack window. When\ncombining all three approaches, we reduce the TOCTOU vulnerabilities from an\nexecuted trajectory from 12% to 8%.

Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a\nlarge R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To\naddress this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve\nunseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language\nmodels (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain\ndynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware\nfunctions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function\npool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query\npairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with\nboth GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks\noperating on real utility data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc804\ub825\ub9dd \uc6b4\uc601 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 PowerChain\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ub825\ub9dd \ubd84\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc.", "motivation": "\uc804\ub825\ub9dd \uc6b4\uc601\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 R&D \uc778\ub825 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "PowerChain\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9\ud558\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9.", "result": "PowerChain\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc804\ub825\ub9dd \ubd84\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c GPT-5 \ubc0f \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 Qwen \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uc804\ub825\ub9dd \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub4e4\uc774 \uace0\uae09 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\uae30\ud654 \ubc0f \ud0c8\ud0c4\uc18c\ud654\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \uc9c4\ud589\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc30\uc804\ub9dd(DG) \uc6b4\uc601 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \ub354\uc6b1 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc804\ub825\ub9dd\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uae09 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uc54c\ub9ac\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 DG \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcf5\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378, \uae30\ub2a5 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc640 \ud611\ub3d9\uc870\ud569\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac1c\ubc1c \uc778\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc720\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uace0\uae09 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs) \uae30\ub2a5 \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 DG \ubd84\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 PowerChain\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\ub2e4. \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc8fc\uba74 PowerChain\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uc804\ub825 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uae30\ub2a5 \ud480\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uacfc \uc120\ubcc4\ub41c \ucc38\uc870 \uc9d1\ud569\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0-\ucffc\ub9ac \uc30d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ubc1b\uc544 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 PowerChain\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 DG \ubd84\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c GPT-5 \ubc0f \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 Qwen \ubaa8\ub378 \ubaa8\ub450\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, many\ncritical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In\nparticular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,\nhow humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the\nrisks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need\nto rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should\nmove beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems\nshould implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.\nFurthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full\nspectrum of human values.

This paper\npresents a comprehensive literature review evaluating how quantum algorithms,\nspecifically Shors and Grovers, could disrupt the foundational security\nmechanisms of cryptocurrencies. Shors algorithm poses a threat to public-key\ncryptographic schemes by enabling efficient factorization and discrete\nlogarithm solving, thereby endangering digital signature systems. Grovers\nalgorithm undermines hash-based functions, increasing the feasibility of fifty\none percent attacks and hash collisions. By examining the internal mechanisms\nof major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, and\nZcash, this review identifies specific vulnerabilities in transaction and\nconsensus processes. It further analyses the current hardware limitations of\nquantum systems and estimates when such attacks could become feasible. In\nanticipation, it investigates countermeasures including Post-Quantum\nCryptography (PQC), Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and protocol-level\nmodifications such as memory-intensive proof-of-work algorithms and\nmulti-signature schemes. The discussion integrates recent advancements in\nquantum error correction, hardware scalability, and NIST-standardized\ncryptographic algorithms. This review concludes that while quantum computers\nare not yet advanced enough to pose an immediate threat, proactive integration\nof quantum-resistant solutions is essential. The findings underscore the urgent\nneed for cryptocurrencies to adopt post-quantum cryptographic standards to\npreserve the decentralized trust, integrity, and security that define\nblockchain-based

The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological\nCounting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and\nTransformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.\nGenerated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity\nfiltering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs\nstruggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of\nrobust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the\nresearch community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the\ndevelopment of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 MaRVL-QA\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MLLM\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc2ec\uce35\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ud45c\uba74 \ud50c\ub86f\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MaRVL-QA\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucd5c\ub300\uce58\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc138\ub294 '\uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc138\uae30'\uc640, \ub2e4\ub978 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 '\ubcc0\ud658 \uc778\uc2dd'\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 MLLM\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4 MaRVL-QA\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ub2a5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub300\uac1c \uc584\ud30d\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MaRVL-QA\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uac00 \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uba70 MLLM \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uac00\uc7a5\uc790\ub9ac \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae4a\uc740 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ud45c\uba74 \ud50c\ub86f\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uace0\ub9bd\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\ub2e8\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud575\uc2ec \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 MaRVL-QA(Visual Landscapes\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucd5c\ub300\uce58\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc138\ub294 '\uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc138\uae30'\uc640 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 '\ubcc0\ud658 \uc778\uc2dd'\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc120\ubcc4\ub41c \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c MaRVL-QA\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 MLLM\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub300\uc2e0 \ud53c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4.

However, current trust-based mechanisms for IoT have limitations\nthat impact data security. Sliding window-based trust schemes cannot ensure\nreliable trust computation due to their inability to select appropriate window\nlengths. Besides, recent trust scores are emphasized when considering the\neffect of time on trust. This can cause a sudden change in overall trust score\nbased on recent behavior, potentially misinterpreting an honest service\nprovider as malicious and vice versa. Moreover, clustering mechanisms used to\nfilter recommendations in trust computation often lead to slower results. In\nthis paper, we propose a robust trust model to address these limitations. The\nproposed approach determines the window length dynamically to guarantee\naccurate trust computation. It uses the harmonic mean of average trust score\nand time to prevent sudden fluctuations in trust scores. Additionally, an\nefficient personalized subspace clustering algorithm is used to exclude\nrecommendations. We present a security analysis demonstrating the resiliency of\nthe proposed scheme against bad-mouthing, ballot-stuffing, and on-off attacks.\nThe proposed scheme demonstrates a competitive performance in detecting\nbad-mouthing attacks, while outperforming existing works with an approximately\n44% improvement in accuracy for detecting on-off attacks. It maintains its\neffectiveness even when the percentage of on-off attackers increases and in\nscenarios where multiple attacks occur simultaneously. Additionally, the\nproposed scheme reduces the recommendation filtering time by 95%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 IoT\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c

In this work,\nwe apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical\nyet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences.\nWhile recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core\ndesign and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial\nmanual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a\nmulti-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster\ndesigners. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and\nCurator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2)\nLayout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist\nagents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4)\nRenderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that\nare both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design\nquality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures\nlayout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence.

This paper focuses on\nthe security problems of large language models (LLMs) in critical application\nscenarios, such as the possibility of disclosure of user data, the deliberate\ninput of harmful instructions, or the models bias. To solve these problems, we\ndescribe the design of a system for dynamic risk assessment and a hierarchical\ndefence system that allows different levels of protection to cooperate. This\npaper presents a risk assessment system capable of evaluating both static and\ndynamic indicators simultaneously. It uses entropy weighting to calculate\nessential data, such as the frequency of sensitive words, whether the API call\nis typical, the realtime risk entropy value is significant, and the degree of\ncontext deviation. The experimental results show that the system is capable of\nidentifying concealed attacks, such as role escape, and can perform rapid risk\nevaluation. The paper uses a hybrid model called BERT-CRF (Bidirectional\nEncoder Representation from Transformers) at the input layer to identify and\nfilter malicious commands. The model layer uses dynamic adversarial training\nand differential privacy noise injection technology together. The output layer\nalso has a neural watermarking system that can track the source of the content.\nIn practice, the quality of this method, especially important in terms of\ncustomer service in the

Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained\nmodels, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear\nprograms (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through\nstructured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a\nnovel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial\ncorrectness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and\nexecution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems,\nGPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and\nobjective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most\neffective prompting strategies.

While typically considered\ncyber-physical systems (CPSs), their dependence on traditional networked\nsoftware stacks (e.g., Linux operating systems), robot operating system (ROS)\nmiddleware, and over-the-air update channels, creates a distinct security\nprofile that exposes them to vulnerabilities conventional CPS models do not\nfully address. Prior studies have mainly examined specific threats, such as\nLiDAR spoofing or adversarial machine learning (AML). This narrow focus\noverlooks how an attack targeting one component can cascade harm throughout the\nrobot's interconnected systems. We address this gap through a systematization\nof knowledge (SoK) that takes a comprehensive approach, consolidating\nfragmented research from robotics, CPS, and network security domains. We\nintroduce a seven-layer security model for humanoid robots, organizing 39 known\nattacks and 35 defenses across the humanoid ecosystem-from hardware to\nhuman-robot interaction. Building on this security model, we develop a\nquantitative 39x35 attack-defense matrix with risk-weighted scoring, validated\nthrough Monte Carlo analysis. We demonstrate our method by evaluating three\nreal-world robots: Pepper, G1 EDU, and Digit. The scoring analysis revealed\nvarying security maturity levels, with scores ranging from 39.9% to 79.5%\nacross the platforms.

Results: Among 17 binary classifiers, Random Forest achieved highest\nperformance (accuracy, F1, precision, recall, ROC-AUC near 0.85).

We\npresent an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the\npolicy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect\ndefines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from\nretrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks\nsafety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes\nfrom a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of\naction values with a $\\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient\nstate with a bounded residual rule.

In comparison with\nXOR and SFLL-HD methods, TLGLock offers up to 3x higher SAT attack resistance\nwith significantly lower overhead.

However, while explainable approaches can help\nunderstand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the\nunderlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many\npractitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency\nwith a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers\nactionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.\nCounterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by\nshowing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We\npropose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a\nnovel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual\nmethods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model\nusing an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used\nto generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original\nunderlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding\nthe ``effort\" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to\ncausal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides\na more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a\nfavourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and\nactionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all\nwhile having a lower cost.

Innovative research methods are\nbeing explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make\nthe decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability\nbecomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains\nlike fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and\nautonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the\nreliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the\nexplanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the\nblackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a\nframework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision\nmaking. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations\n(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms\nto provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of\nIDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on\na specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of\nsignificant features and their relationship with attack traffic.

Traditional detection\ntechniques often struggle to keep pace with emerging malware variants that\nemploy advanced tactics such as code obfuscation and dynamic behavior\ntriggering. One major limitation of these approaches is their inability to\nlocalize malicious payloads at a fine-grained level, hindering precise\nunderstanding of malicious behavior. This gap in understanding makes the design\nof effective and targeted mitigation strategies difficult, leaving mobile apps\nvulnerable to continuously evolving threats.\n  To address this gap, we propose MalLoc, a novel approach that leverages the\ncode understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to localize\nmalicious payloads at a fine-grained level within Android malware. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using\nLLMs for this task, highlighting the potential of MalLoc to enhance precision\nand interpretability in malware analysis.

However, SEWs face inherent\nlimitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading\ncomputations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and\nserver workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a\nFederated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to\ntrain collaboratively while preserving data privacy.

In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple\nmodalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present\nERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced\nreceptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio\nand video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information\nto improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+\nlies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual\ninput, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake\ncontent. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset,\nwhich consists of both segmented and full-length video clips.

Conventional\nmethods based on static heuristics and catalog-based estimations often struggle\nto adapt to dynamic production environments, resulting in suboptimal solutions\nand increased waste. In response, we propose a novel Quantum-Inspired Deep\nReinforcement Learning (QI-DRL) framework that integrates Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) networks with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This hybrid approach is\ndesigned to explicitly address key research questions regarding the benefits of\nquantum-inspired probabilistic representations, the role of LSTM-based memory\nin capturing sequential dependencies, and the effectiveness of OU noise in\nfacilitating smooth exploration and faster convergence. Extensive training over\n1000 episodes demonstrates robust performance, with an average reward of 0.81\n(-+0.03) and a steady decrease in prediction loss to 0.15 (-+0.02). A\ncomparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves fabric cost\nsavings of up to 13% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, statistical\nevaluations indicate low variability and stable convergence.

However, as DTs take active roles in\ncontrol loops, securely binding them to their physical counterparts in dynamic\nand adversarial environments remains a significant challenge. Existing\nauthentication solutions either rely on static trust models, require\ncentralised authorities, or fail to provide live and verifiable\nphysical-digital binding, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive and\ndistributed deployments. To address this gap, we introduce PRZK-Bind, a\nlightweight and decentralised authentication protocol that combines\nSchnorr-based zero-knowledge proofs with elliptic curve cryptography to\nestablish secure, real-time correspondence between physical entities and DTs\nwithout relying on pre-shared secrets. Simulation results show that PRZK-Bind\nsignificantly improves performance, offering up to 4.5 times lower latency and\n4 times reduced energy consumption compared to cryptography-heavy baselines,\nwhile maintaining false acceptance rates more than 10 times lower. These\nfindings highlight its suitability for future smart city deployments requiring\nefficient, resilient, and trustworthy DT authentication.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRZK-Bind\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uac1c\uccb4\uc640 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc30d\ub465\uc774 \uac04\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc778\uc99d \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud2b8\uc708 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud2f0 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub098, \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ub300\uc0c1\uc744 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Schnorr \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc601 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\uba85\uacfc \ud0c0\uc6d0 \uace1\uc120 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc804 \uacf5\uc720 \ube44\ubc00 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uac1c\uccb4\uc640 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc30d\ub465\uc774 \uac04\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub300\uc751\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\ub294 PRZK-Bind \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PRZK-Bind\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 4.5\ubc30 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc 4\ubc30 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e0 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud5c8\uc704 \uc218\uc6a9\uc728\uc740 10\ubc30 \uc774\uc0c1 \ub0ae\ucd98\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PRZK-Bind\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc30d\ub465\uc774 \uc778\uc99d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud2f0 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud2b8\uc708(DT) \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud2f0 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774 \ub418\uc5b4\uac00\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc601\uc5ed \uac04\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\uc640 \uc790\uc728 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 DT\uac00 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ub300\uc751\uccb4\uc640 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc778\uc99d \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098, \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uae30\uad00\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uac70\ub098, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc774\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac-\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uacb0\ud569\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \uacf5\uc720 \ube44\ubc00\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uac1c\uccb4\uc640 DT \uac04\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub300\uc751\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc778\uc99d \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc778 PRZK-Bind\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 PRZK-Bind\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\ub300 4.5\ubc30 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc 4\ubc30 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e0 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c, \ud5c8\uc704 \uc218\uc6a9\uc728\uc740 10\ubc30 \uc774\uc0c1 \ub0ae\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 DT \uc778\uc99d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud2f0 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs,\nCrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive\nbias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent\nsystem.

The Move\nlanguage, with its unique resource model and linear type system, provides a\nsolid foundation for the security of digital assets. However, smart contracts\nstill face new security challenges due to developer programming errors and the\npotential risks associated with cross-module interactions. This paper\nsystematically analyzes the limitations of existing security tools within the\nMove ecosystem and reveals their unique vulnerability patterns. To address\nthese issues, it introduces MoveScanner, a static analysis tool based on a\ncontrol flow graph and data flow analysis architecture. By incorporating\ncross-module call graph tracking, MoveScanner can effectively identify five key\ntypes of security vulnerabilities, including resource leaks, weak permission\nmanagement, and arithmetic overflows. In terms of design, MoveScanner adheres\nto a modular principle, supports bytecode-level analysis and multi-chain\nadaptation, and introduces innovative resource trajectory tracking algorithms\nand capability matrix analysis methods, thereby significantly reducing the\nfalse positive rate. Empirical results show that MoveScanner achieved 88.2%\ndetection accuracy in benchmark testing, filling the gap in security tools in\nthe Move ecosystem. Furthermore, this paper identifies twelve new types of\nsecurity risks based on the resource-oriented programming paradigm and provides\na theoretical foundation and practical experience for the development of smart\ncontract security mechanisms.

Despite their\nadvances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated\nmeta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that\nenables \"thinking about thinking\". This absence leaves their emergent abilities\nuncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and\ninflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce\nMeta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit\nmetacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,\nMeta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and\nmeta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and\nadaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three\nchallenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that\nMeta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to\n27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and\nimproving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;\nand (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and\nmodel backbones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 LRMs\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ub300\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70 \ube44\uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0-R1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac LRMs\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec emergent \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uba54\ud0c0-R1\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uac1d\uccb4 \uc218\uc900\uacfc \uba54\ud0c0 \uc218\uc900 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec proactive planning, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc870\uae30 \uc885\ub8cc\ub97c \uc9d1\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uba54\ud0c0-R1\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 27.3% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud1a0\ud070 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c 15.7%\uc5d0\uc11c 32.7%\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 14.8% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uba54\ud0c0-R1\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc31\ubcf8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRMs)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, emergent\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\uace0 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 LRM\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc778\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c '\uc0dd\uac01\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0dd\uac01'\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc218\uc900 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uc5ec\ub294 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 emergent \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\uc81c\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uac8c(\ube44\ub300\uc751\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0), \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uac8c(\uc911\uac04 \uc624\ub958), \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uac8c(\uba85\ud655\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc758 \ubd80\uc871) \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LRMs\uc5d0 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Meta-R1\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c Meta-R1\uc740 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ub41c \uac1d\uccb4 \uc218\uc900 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc218\uc900 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc9d1\ud569\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \uacc4\ud68d, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uaddc\uc81c \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc870\uae30 \uc885\ub8cc\ub97c \uc870\uc728\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc5ec\ub35f \uac1c\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 Meta-R1\uc774 (I) \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub192\uc544 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 27.3% \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4;

The\nability to identify outliers in data streams is essential for maintaining data\nquality and detecting faults. However, dealing with data streams presents\nchallenges due to the non-stationary nature of distributions and the\never-increasing data volume. While numerous methods have been proposed to\ntackle this challenge, a common drawback is the lack of straightforward\nparameterization in many of them. This article introduces two novel methods:\nDyCF and DyCG. DyCF leverages the Christoffel function from the theory of\napproximation and orthogonal polynomials. Conversely, DyCG capitalizes on the\ngrowth properties of the Christoffel function, eliminating the need for tuning\nparameters. Both approaches are firmly rooted in a well-defined algebraic\nframework, meeting crucial demands for data stream processing, with a specific\nfocus on addressing low-dimensional aspects and maintaining data history\nwithout memory cost. A comprehensive comparison between DyCF, DyCG, and\nstate-of-the-art methods is presented, using both synthetic and real industrial\ndata streams. The results show that DyCF outperforms fine-tuning methods,\noffering superior performance in terms of execution time and memory usage.

PoC reports may include critical information\nsuch as specific usage, test platforms, and more, providing essential insights\nfor researchers. However, in reality, due to various PoC templates across PoC\nplatforms, PoC reports extensively suffer from information deficiency, leading\nthe suboptimal quality and limited usefulness. Fortunately, we found that\ninformation deficiency of PoC reports could be mitigated by the completion from\nmultiple sources given the same referred vulnerability. In this paper, we\nconduct the first study on the deficiency of information in PoC reports across\npublic platforms. We began by collecting 173,170 PoC reports from 4 different\nplatforms and defined 8 key aspects that PoCs should contain. By integrating\nrule-based matching and a fine-tuned BERT-NER model for extraction of key\naspects, we discovered that all PoC reports available on public platforms have\nat least one missing key aspect. Subsequently, we developed a multi-source\ninformation fusion method to complete the missing aspect information in PoC\nreports by leveraging CVE entries and related PoC reports from different\nsources. Finally, we successfully completed 69,583 PoC reports (40.18% of all\nreports).", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacf5\uac1c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c PoC \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \uacb0\ud54d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd9c\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uce21\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucc44\uc6b0\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "PoC \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub294 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub098, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4 \uacb0\ud54d\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "4\uac1c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c 173,170\uac1c\uc758 PoC \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, 8\uac1c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uce21\uba74\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ub9e4\uce6d\uacfc \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ub41c BERT-NER \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacf5\uac1c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc758 PoC \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc18c \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uce21\uba74\uc774 \ub204\ub77d\ub41c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd9c\ucc98\uc758 CVE \ud56d\ubaa9 \ubc0f \uad00\ub828 PoC \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ucc98 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc735\ud569 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uad6d, 69,583\uac1c\uc758 PoC \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(\uc804\uccb4 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc758 40.18%).", "translated_summary": "\ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85(Proof-of-Concept, PoC)\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uc545\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, they\noften overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are\nhighly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time\nand distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting\nthe user's next location. Against this background, we propose \\textbf{STRelay},\na universal \\textbf{\\underline{S}}patio\\textbf{\\underline{T}}emporal\n\\textbf{\\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future\nspatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of\ndifferent location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future\nspatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated\nwith the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction\nmodel, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time\ninterval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We\nevaluate STRelay integrated with four state-of-the-art location prediction base\nmodels on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay\nconsistently improves prediction performance across all cases by\n3.19\\%-11.56\\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts\nare particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user\ngroups who prefer traveling longer distances.

However, a significant challenge for IDS in training detection models\nis the shortage of adequately labeled malicious samples. To address these\nissues, this paper introduces a novel semi-supervised framework\n\\textbf{GANGRL-LLM}, which integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nwith Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance malicious code generation and SQL\nInjection (SQLi) detection capabilities in few-sample learning scenarios.\nSpecifically, our framework adopts a collaborative training paradigm where: (1)\nthe GAN-based discriminator improves malicious pattern recognition through\nadversarial learning with generated samples and limited real samples; and (2)\nthe LLM-based generator refines the quality of malicious code synthesis using\nreward signals from the discriminator. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat even with a limited number of labeled samples, our training framework is\nhighly effective in enhancing both malicious code generation and detection\ncapabilities. This dual enhancement capability offers a promising solution for\ndeveloping adaptive defense systems capable of countering evolving cyber\nthreats.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc SQL \uc8fc\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GAN\uacfc LLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc900\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GANGRL-LLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "IDS\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \uc545\uc131 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GAN \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud310\ubcc4\uc790\uc640 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc790\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\uc5c5 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud55c\uc815\ub41c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\uc911 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(IDS)\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 IDS\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc801\uc808\ud558\uac8c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \uc545\uc131 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GAN)\uacfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc18c\uc218 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f SQL \uc8fc\uc785(SQLi) \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc900\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c GANGRL-LLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 (1) GAN \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud310\ubcc4\uc790\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc545\uc131 \ud328\ud134 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, (2) LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc790\uac00 \ud310\ubcc4\uc790\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \ud569\uc131\uc758 \uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud611\ub825 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc218\uc758 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825 \ubaa8\ub450\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc911 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Current methods, relying on symbolic\nregression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual\nphenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to\nphysicists. This \"sensory deprivation\" severely weakens their ability to\ninterpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To\naddress this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual\nInduction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic\nformulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic\nreasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via\na curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning\nto interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a\nCausal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration\n(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During\ninference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a\nhigh-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic\nregression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final\nstep, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the\ntheoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce\nPhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that\nVIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy\nand interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws.

Although advanced\nSpatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have\nachieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain:\n(i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal\ndependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal\npoints due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates\nretrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these\nchallenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder\nand Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and\nconstruct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval\nStore and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns;\nand 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained\nSTGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world\ntraffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST\nachieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAST\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\uc774\uba70 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub9e5\ub77d \uc6a9\ub7c9\uacfc \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ud134\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "RAST\ub294 RAG\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc5bb\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\ub294 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0 \uc794\uc5ec \uc735\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc735\ud569 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uc778\ucf54\ub354 \ubc0f \ucffc\ub9ac \uc0dd\uc131\uae30, \ubca1\ud130\ud654\ub41c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c \ubc0f \uac80\uc0c9\uae30, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c STGNN \ub610\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c MLP \uc608\uce21\uae30\ub97c \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \uc218\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801 \ubc31\ubcf8 \uc608\uce21\uae30\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad50\ud1b5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, RAST\ub294 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, RAST\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\uc774\uba70 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\uae09 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(STGNN)\uacfc \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub9e5\ub77d \uc6a9\ub7c9, (ii) \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ud134\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131. \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 RAST\ub77c\ub294 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc124\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4: 1) \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0 \uc794\uc5ec \uc735\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc735\ud569 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uc778\ucf54\ub354 \ubc0f \ucffc\ub9ac \uc0dd\uc131\uae30;

Efraimidis"], "title": "Large Language Models as Universal Predictors? An Empirical Study on Small Tabular Datasets", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language\nprocessing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across\nmodalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs\ncan perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit\nfine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical\nfunction approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets\nfor classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the\nperformance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash,\nDeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established\nmachine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and\ntabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong\nperformance in classification tasks under limited data availability,\nestablishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in\nregression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely\nbecause regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and\nclustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of\ngenuine ICL in this setting.

Previous memory\nmechanisms of LLM-based agents are manually predefined by human experts,\nleading to higher labor costs and suboptimal performance. In addition, these\nmethods overlook the memory cycle effect in interactive scenarios, which is\ncritical to optimizing LLM-based agents for specific environments. To address\nthese challenges, in this paper, we propose to optimize LLM-based agents with\nan adaptive and data-driven memory framework by modeling memory cycles.\nSpecifically, we design an MoE gate function to facilitate memory retrieval,\npropose a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and\ndevelop task-specific reflection to adapt memory storage. Our memory framework\nempowers LLM-based agents to learn how to memorize information effectively in\nspecific environments, with both off-policy and on-policy optimization.

Techniques are semantically mapped to phases\nvia ATTACK-BERT, producing seven phase-specific datasets.

In this study, we develop a new recurrent\ntransformer U-Net surrogate model to provide very fast predictions for pressure\nand CO2 saturation in realistic faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The\ngeomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),\nsurrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.\nThe faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The\nheterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by\nhierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,\nmean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell\nproperties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also\ntreated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)\n4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is\nmore accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains\naccuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is\nthen used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different\nmonitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed\ndata collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true\nmodels. Detailed results demonstrate the degree of uncertainty reduction\nachieved with the various monitoring strategies. Posterior results for 3D\nsaturation plumes and leakage volumes indicate the benefits of measuring\npressure and saturation in all three aquifers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

Simulating Vulnerabilities, and Threats in Multimodal Medical RAG System", "comment": "Sumbitted to 2025 AAAI main track", "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual\ngrounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this\nreliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel\nmultimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in\nmedical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation\nof our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack\nenvironment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic\nknowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting,\nwe introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds\nsubtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports.\nThese mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal\nalignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters.\nWhile basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI\ndemonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR\nQA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and\nlowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose\nfundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need\nfor threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we\nconclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of\nfuture multimodal medical RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc758\ub8cc AI\uc5d0\uc11c \uc678\ubd80 \uc784\uc0c1

Reward\nhacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to\noverwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study\nthe behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand\nexamples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as\nwriting poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to\ntrain models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on\nthese tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new\nsettings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward\nfunctions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the\ntraining data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of\nmisalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,\nencouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These\nfine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models\ntrained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or\nharmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn\nto reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though\nconfirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub9ac\uc6cc\ub4dc \ud574\ud0b9\uc740 AI \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294

This study explores the potential of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode\nchoice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground\npredictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating\nRAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval\nstrategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder\nfor re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for\nre-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI\nGPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning\ncapabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional\nHousehold Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate\nmodel performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances\npredictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model\ncombined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the\nhighest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and\nmachine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior\ngeneralization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the\ncritical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies,\ndemonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model\ncapabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc5ec\ud589 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc120\ud0dd

While conventional graph shift operators\n(GSOs) are effective for certain tasks, they inherently lack flexibility in\nmodeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to\nrepresent complex graph structures. To address this limitation, this paper\nproposes the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework, which integrates the\nextended-adjacency matrix and the unified graph representation matrix through\nparametric design, so as to be able to flexibly adapt to different graph\nstructures and reveal more graph signal information. Theoretical analysis of\nthe UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue\nmonotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we propose graph Fourier\ntransform based on UEM (UEM-GFT), which can adaptively tune spectral properties\nto enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based\nmethods in anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior performance across\nvarying network topologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc778\uc811 \ub178\ub4dc \uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud655\uc7a5 \ud589\ub82c(UEM) \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\ud638 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2dc\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub294 \ube44\uc778\uc811 \ub178\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud655\uc7a5 \uc778\uc811 \ud589\ub82c\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 UEM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ud6c4, UEM\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ud658(UEM-GFT)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ud638 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, UEM-GFT\uac00 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 GSO \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "UEM-GFT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\ud638 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2dc\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub294 \ube44\uc778\uc811 \ub178\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud655\uc7a5 \uc778\uc811 \ud589\ub82c\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud655\uc7a5 \ud589\ub82c(UEM) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

In this paper, we\nidentify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an\nabstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming\npatterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this\nblind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal\nedits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as\na Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).\n  We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects\nFPAs into target code.

However,\nthis challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting\nof old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity\nRepresentations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN\nexplicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a\nfine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order\nInteraction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific\nfeatures from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation\nstream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared\nacross all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a\nmulti-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained\nknowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting\nand alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,\nwe design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a\ndecoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision\nboundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP\nbenchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN\nachieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to\nstate-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches.

While\ntraditional risk assessment frameworks evaluate conventional cybersecurity\nrisks, they lack ability to address unique challenges posed by AML threats.\nExisting AML threat evaluation approaches focus primarily on technical attack\nrobustness, overlooking crucial real-world factors like deployment\nenvironments, system dependencies, and attack feasibility. Attempts at\ncomprehensive AML risk assessment have been limited to domain-specific\nsolutions, preventing application across diverse systems. Addressing these\nlimitations, we present FRAME, the first comprehensive and automated framework\nfor assessing AML risks across diverse ML-based systems. FRAME includes a novel\nrisk assessment method that quantifies AML risks by systematically evaluating\nthree key dimensions: target system's deployment environment, characteristics\nof diverse AML techniques, and empirical insights from prior research. FRAME\nincorporates a feasibility scoring mechanism and LLM-based customization for\nsystem-specific assessments. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive\nstructured dataset of AML attacks enabling context-aware risk assessment. From\nan engineering application perspective, FRAME delivers actionable results\ndesigned for direct use by system owners with only technical knowledge of their\nsystems, without expertise in AML. We validated it across six diverse\nreal-world applications. Our evaluation demonstrated exceptional accuracy and\nstrong alignment with analysis by AML experts.

These\ndata are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the\nquality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce\nTradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these\nlimitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end\ndata-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news\nsentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,\ntrading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all\nsignals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.\nSpecifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,\nstyle, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for\nsimilar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management\nmodel to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In\naddition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation\npipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving\nthe agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across\nfive real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance\nover rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing\nLLM-based trading strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "TradingGroup\uc740 \uc790\uac00 \ubc18\uc601 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d, \uc7ac\ubb34 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \ud574\uc11d, \uc8fc\uc2dd \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uac70\ub798 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac70\ub798 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc870 \ubc0f \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ud6c4\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TradingGroup\uc740 \ub274\uc2a4 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d, \uc7ac\ubb34 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \ud574\uc11d, \uc8fc\uc2dd \ucd94\uc138 \uc608\uce21, \uac70\ub798 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc801\uc751 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uccb4\uacc4\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "TradingGroup\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc8fc\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc31\ud14c\uc2a4\ud305 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub8f0 \uae30\ubc18, \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd, \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uac70\ub798 \uc804\ub7b5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TradingGroup\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud6c4\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uac00 \ubc18\uc601 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \uad00\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uac70\ub798 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uae08\uc735 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d, \uc7ac\ubb34 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uc8fc\uc2dd \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud611\uc870, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc131, \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc870\uac74\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uac70\ub798 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud6c4\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc131 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac70\ub798 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 TradingGroup\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from\nvariance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when\ndeployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of\nstatistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including\nbootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval\nconstruction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to\nimprove robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load\nForecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids\nconsistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons.\nRegression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap\naggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects\nsystematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal\ncoverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results\nindicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models\nyields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for\nreal-world time series applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6b4\uc601 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub7a9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc30\uae45, \ud68c\uadc0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ud0dc\ud0b9, \uc608\uce21 \uad6c\uac04 \uad6c\uc131, \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc794\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc624\ub958 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc220\ub4e4\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2dc\uac04\ub300\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e8\ub3c5 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubc0f \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Lag-Llama, TimeGPT, Chronos, MOMENT, UniTS, TimesFM\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378(TSFMs)\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21, \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0, \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc644\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc7a5\uc810\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6b4\uc601 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub420 \ub54c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud3b8\ud5a5, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub7a9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc30\uae45, \ud68c\uadc0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ud0dc\ud0b9, \uc608\uce21 \uad6c\uac04 \uad6c\uc131, \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc794\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc624\ub958 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uae30\ubc18 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc95\uc758 \ubaa8\uc74c\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubca8\uae30\uc5d0 \uc804\uae30 \ub2e8\uae30 \ubd80\ud558 \uc608\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2dc\uac04\ub300\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud68c\uadc0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc740 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub7a9 \uc9d1\ud569\uc740 \uae34 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4; \uc794\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc740 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc608\uce21 \uad6c\uac04\uc740 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uae38\uc774\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud3ed\uc774 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e4\uba74\uc11c \uac70\uc758 \uba85\ubaa9\uc0c1\uc758 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc815\ud655\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubc0f \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc628\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In Ultimate, the player holding the disc\ncannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'\nmovements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative\nevaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game\nsituations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for\nmovement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was\nrecorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which\nwill be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations\nwere detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting\nthe timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were\nanalyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control\nreflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation\nvalues across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most\nfavorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact\nof movement timing.\n  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was\nactually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the\nsequences without a throw.\n  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader\ndistribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.\n  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective\nmeans of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to\nquantify in unlabeled team sport plays.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

Despite their varied\narchitectures, many share a common foundation in probabilistic latent variable\nmodels (PLVMs), where hidden variables explain observed data for density\nestimation, latent reasoning, and structured inference. This paper presents a\nunified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods\nwithin the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models\nsuch as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item\nresponse theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential\nextensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical\nSystems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep\nPLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential\nPLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative\nAdversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a\ncommon probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference\nstrategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths. We\noffer a conceptual roadmap that consolidates generative AI's theoretical\nfoundations, clarifies methodological lineages, and guides future innovation by\ngrounding emerging architectures in their probabilistic heritage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ubc0f \ud604\ub300\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud655\ub960\ub860\uc801 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubcc0\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc131 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub4e4\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc2dc\uac01\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uace0\uc804\uc801 \ud3c9\uba74 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\ubd80\ud130 \ud604\ub300\uc758 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uae4c\uc9c0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 PLVM \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub808\uc784\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uc801\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "PLVM\uc758 \uacf5\ud1b5 \ud655\ub960\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uc720 \uc6d0\uce59, \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \uaddc\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\uc801 \uc808\ucda9\uc810\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0dd\uc131 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc815\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uacc4\ubcf4\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0, \uc0dd\uc131 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc740 \uc774\uc81c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubc00\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad00\ucc30 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubcc0\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378(PLVM)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uacf5\ud1b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 PLVM \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ubc0f \ud604\ub300\uc801 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 PCA, \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud63c\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd84\uc11d, \ud56d\ubaa9 \ubc18\uc751 \uc774\ub860, \uc7a0\uc7ac \ub514\ub9ac\ud074\ub808 \ud560\ub2f9 \ub4f1\uc758 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ud3c9\uba74 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc5ec, \uc740\ub2c9 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378, \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 HMM, \uc120\ud615 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub4f1\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uac70\uccd0 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uae4a\uc740 PLVM\uc73c\ub85c, \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c PLVM\uc73c\ub85c, \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc778 PLVM\uc73c\ub85c, \uc790\uae30 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 PLVM\uc73c\ub85c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacf5\ud1b5 \ud655\ub960\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\ub958 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc14\ub77c\ubcf4\uba74 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc6d0\uce59, \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5, \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\uc801 \uc808\ucda9\uc810\uc774 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0a9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 AI\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uacc4\ubcf4\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc720\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ud601\uc2e0\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub04c\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, these systems\nare bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities\nof LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops\ncreative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer\nattempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that\ndisassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity\nfrom unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an\ninspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline\nthat refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts\nnovel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000\nacademic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds\nlinks between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their\nplausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to\nour experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies\nhigh-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline\nalso successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal\narticles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates\nthat this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases.

However, conventional DNN training\ntypically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on\nedge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To\naddress this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),\nnamed NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting\ndimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling\nin the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based\nmethods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,\nNMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method\nand the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the\nemergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,\ntarget perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and\nleading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of\nexamplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose\nAdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the\nFireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided\noptimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative\ntraining samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the\nedge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and\nentropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and\ntime-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ub525 \ub274\ub7f4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(DNN)\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 DNN \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, DNN \uc5c6\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 NMS\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 NMS\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4: \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\ub2e8\uc870\uc131 \uc131\uc9c8\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1\uce58 \ucd9c\ud604, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AdapSNE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ub2e8\uc870\uc131 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 FWA\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c DNN \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "NMS\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AdapSNE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 FWA\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ube44\ub2e8\uc870\uc131 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "AdapSNE\ub294 \ub354 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc9c0 \uce21\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud750\ub984\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e4\uc911\ud654\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AdapSNE\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc5d0\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ub525 \ub274\ub7f4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(DNN)\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 DNN \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc2e0\uc0dd \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0 \ub9c9\ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ubd80\ud558\ub97c \ubd80\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, DNN \uc5c6\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc14b \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 NMS(\uadfc\uc811 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1)\uac00 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c \ud6c4 \ucd95\uc18c\ub41c \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uc2dc \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, NMS\ub294 DNN \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8\uc778 NMS\uc5d0\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4: (1) \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\ub2e8\uc870\uc131 \ud37c\ud50c\ub809\uc2dc\ud2f0 \uc624\ub958 \ud568\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucd95\uc18c\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70;

To understand this\nphenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training\ndata that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We\nbuild on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call\nskill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization.

Total 9 pages with 8 figures", "summary": "Acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent\nwake flow fields in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments remains a\nsignificant challenge due to hardware limitations and measurement noise. In\ncontrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall\npressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study,\nwe propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which\nreconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing\nsynchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during\ntraining, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first\nstage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\\beta$-variation autoencoder\n($p$C-$\\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the\nintrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized\nlow-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling\nreconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once\ntrained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure\ninputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the\n$p$C-$\\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics\nfrom temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust\nsolution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in\ndata-constrained experimental settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "LatentFlow\ub294 \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c \ubcbd \uc555\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \ub09c\ub958 \uc640\ub958 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac PIV \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \ubc0f \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ub09c\ub958 \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \ud68d\ub4dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc81c\ud55c\uacfc \uce21\uc815 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "LatentFlow\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ub41c \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc\uc640 \uc555\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \ub09c\ub958 \uc640\ub958 \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, $\beta$-\ubcc0\uc774 \uc624\ud1a0 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc555\ub825\uc5d0 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ub41c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c \ubcbd \uc555\ub825 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LatentFlow\ub294 \ud750\ub984 \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uc555\ub825 \uce21\uc815\uacfc \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc81c\uc57d \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \ub09c\ub958 \uc640\ub958 \ud750\ub984 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc785\uc790 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc18d\ub3c4\uacc4(PIV) \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc21c\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ub09c\ub958 \uc640\ub958 \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uc5bb\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc81c\ud55c \ubc0f \uce21\uc815 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \ud48d\ub3d9 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \ubcbd\uc555\uc758 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \uc218\uce58\ub294 \ub354 \uc27d\uac8c \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ub41c \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c(15Hz) \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc\uc640 \uc555\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c(512Hz) \ub09c\ub958 \uc640\ub958 \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc5c5\uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LatentFlow\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc555\ub825\uc5d0 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ub41c $\beta$-\ubcc0\uc774 \uc624\ud1a0 \uc778\ucf54\ub354($p$C-$\beta$-VAE)\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc640\ub958 \ud750\ub984\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ub41c \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c \ubcbd\uc555 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uc5ec \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \ubcbd\uc555\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc640\ub958 \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uc644\ub8cc\ub418\uba74 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c\uc758 \uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \ubcbd\uc555 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec $p$C-$\beta$-VAE \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Work in progress", "summary": "Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit\nnear-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these\nsystems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning\nframeworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in\ndifferent ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that\ndecomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks\ndominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across\ndifferent scenarios.

Yet, today's deployments still rely\nheavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this\nlimitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic\nframework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents\nbased on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that\nrequire explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural\nlanguage intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and\norchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a\nself-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time\nscales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to\nnetwork-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is\nthe AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent\ninteractions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control\nalgorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of\nfunctions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We\ndemonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing\nuser demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents.

Although Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) models may enhance the accuracy and contextual understanding\nof remote heart rate monitoring, the integration of activity data is still\nrarely addressed. In this paper, we propose a Transformer model combined with a\nLaplace diffusion technique to model heart rate fluctuations driven by physical\nactivity of the patient. Unlike prior models that treat activity as secondary,\nour approach conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using\nspecialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity specific\nhistorical patents. The model captures both long-term patterns and\nactivity-specific heart rate dynamics by incorporating contextualized\nembeddings and dedicated encoder. The Transformer model was validated on a\nreal-world dataset collected from 29 patients over a 4-month period.\nExperimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving a 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the\nconsidered baseline models.

Post-training methods have been explored to address\nthese challenges, adapting models to newly emerging data. However, these\nmethods struggle when the initial pre-training is performed on class-imbalanced\ndatasets, limiting generalization to minority classes. To address this, we\npropose a method that effectively handles open-world problems even when\npre-training is conducted on imbalanced data. Our contrastive-based\npre-training approach enhances classification performance, particularly for\nunderrepresented classes.

Recent advances\nin training optimization for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs)\nprimarily focus on architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments.\nHowever, these approaches lack systematic optimization of weight patterns\nduring training. Weight pattern refers to the distribution and relative\nmagnitudes of weight parameters in a neural network. To address this issue, we\npropose a Weight Scaling method called WISCA to enhance training efficiency and\nmodel quality by strategically improving neural network weight patterns without\nchanging network structures. By rescaling weights while preserving model\noutputs, WISCA indirectly optimizes the model's training trajectory.\nExperiments demonstrate that WISCA significantly improves convergence quality\n(measured by generalization capability and loss reduction), particularly in\nLLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning\ntasks.

In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are\nspecifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come\nwith significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address\nthese trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)\ncognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a\nslower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module\nactively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative\nfeedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine\nits solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.\nExtensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate\nthat our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving\ncapabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that\nmatch or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less\ntime. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,\nwe engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the\nLLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem\ndomain and leads to improved overall performance.

Furthermore, to tackle the\ndistribution discrepancies between offline data and the current policy, we\ndesign a sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism that dynamically chooses\nbetween imitating offline distilled data and learning from its own policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc740 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c RED \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ub9ce\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc18c\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c RLVR\uacfc \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc99d\ub958\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc815\uc81c\ub41c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 RED\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubcc0\ud654 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778-SFT\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud558\uace0, \uc18c\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud604\uc7ac \uc815\ucc45 \uac04\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45 \uc774\ub3d9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLVR)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\ub098, \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(SLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc740 \uc544\uc9c1 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc18c\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 RLVR\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \textit{\textbf{R}}ecall-\textit{\textbf{E}}xtend \textit{\textbf{D}}ynamics(RED): \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc815\uc81c\ub41c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc99d\ub958\uc640 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uade0\ud615\uc788\uac8c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0, \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc0bd\uc785 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubc0f \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubcc0\ud654 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778-SFT\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud558\uc5ec \uc18c\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uc99d\ub958 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud604\uc7ac \uc815\ucc45 \uac04\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc99d\ub958\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83 \uac04\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45 \uc774\ub3d9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

This is\n  the preprint version, not peer-reviewed. The final version may differ after\n  peer review. (11 pages, 3 figures)", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to\ntheir immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating\nweight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix\nreconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's\nfunctional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank\nDecomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a\nprimary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank\ncorrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual\nerror. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and\nLlama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to\n51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,\nconsistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse.

This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the\nSpatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a\nunified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively\ncaptures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on\nseparate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly\nmodels correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically\nweighing connections across both dimensions.

The analysis is guided by critical review\nquestions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,\nand prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted\nexperiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in\nautomatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.\nUsing a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:\nAct-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the\nobtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation\naccuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural\nlanguage and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations\nin accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate\nseveral future research directions, including structured datasets,\ndomain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular\nmulti-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs.

While existing methods capture either aleatoric or epistemic\nuncertainty, few offer closed-form, multidimensional distributions that\npreserve spatial correlation while remaining computationally tractable. In this\nwork, we present a framework for training neural networks with a\nmultidimensional Gaussian loss, generating closed-form predictive distributions\nover outputs with non-identically distributed and heteroscedastic structure.\nOur approach captures aleatoric uncertainty by iteratively estimating the means\nand covariance matrices, and is demonstrated on a super-resolution example. We\nleverage a Fourier representation of the covariance matrix to stabilize network\ntraining and preserve spatial correlation. We introduce a novel regularization\nstrategy -- referred to as information sharing -- that interpolates between\nimage-specific and global covariance estimates, enabling convergence of the\nsuper-resolution downscaling network trained on image-specific distributional\nloss functions. This framework allows for efficient sampling, explicit\ncorrelation modeling, and extensions to more complex distribution families all\nwithout disrupting prediction performance.

We introduce a novel paradigm: embedding concepts as linear\nsubspaces. This framework inherently models generality via subspace\ndimensionality and hierarchy through subspace inclusion. It naturally supports\nset-theoretic operations like intersection (conjunction), linear sum\n(disjunction) and orthogonal complements (negations), aligning with classical\nformal semantics. To enable differentiable learning, we propose a smooth\nrelaxation of orthogonal projection operators, allowing for the learning of\nboth subspace orientation and dimension. Our method achieves state-of-the-art\nresults in reconstruction and link prediction on WordNet.

By employing distinct\nnotation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text\npairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the\ntextual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21\ncontemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision\nfrequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems\ncontaining semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is\nrelatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception\nfailures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures\nthat induce hallucinations.

A key novelty of this method\nis the introduction of a novel activation function derived from the solutions\nof the Riccati equation, establishing a new mathematical link between\ndifferential equations theory and deep learning. By combining the strong\napproximation capability of NNs with the high precision of symbolic\ncomputation, AENNM significantly enhances computational efficiency and\naccuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the AENNM in solving NLPDEs,\nthree numerical examples are investigated, including the nonlinear evolution\nequation, the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation, and the (2+1)-dimensional\nBoussinesq equation. Furthermore, some new trial functions are constructed by\nsetting specific activation functions within the \"2-2-2-1\" and \"3-2-2-1\" NNs\nmodels. By embedding the auxiliary equation method into the NNs framework, we\nderive previously unreported solutions.

Please refer to source code\n  available at: https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor", "summary": "Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,\nfinancial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve\nflexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).\nThese tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and\nanswer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To\nautomate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,\nmethods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured\nones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that\nST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy.

However, a significant gap exists\nbetween DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity\nand the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate\nsuperior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should\nallow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of\nobjects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge\nthis gap by introducing ALSO $\\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer\n$\\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can\nhandle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our\nproposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL\nmodels.

Despite their\nubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within\nbillions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture\nand cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by\nadopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and\ndeveloping a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM\narchitectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model\nanalysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that\nwhile LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in\nspecific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose\nemergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected\ncognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains.

However, the factors that drive this\nbrain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,\ntraining and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like\nrepresentations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers\n(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their\nrepresentations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI\nand MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess\nthe brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall\nrepresentational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.\nWe show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -\nindependently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.\nIn particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric\nimages reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like\nrepresentations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:\nmodels first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and\nonly align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with\nconsiderably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed\nby both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the\nrepresentations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with\nthe cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least\nmyelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the\ninterplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural\nnetworks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising\nframework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual\nworld.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 DINOv3\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ud615 \ube44\uc804 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \ub1cc\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc591, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615\uc774 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub1cc \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce68\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc5f0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub9ce\uc740 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \ub1cc\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub1cc-\ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "DINOv3\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ud615 \ube44\uc804 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubaa8\ub378, \ud6c8\ub828, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ub1cc\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud45c\ud604 \ubc1c\ub2ec\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc778(\ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc591, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615)\uc774 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub1cc \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c DINOv3 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \ub1cc \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774 \uc778\uacf5 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\uc0c1\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc790\uc5f0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uba74\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ub1cc\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub1cc-\ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uc778\uc740 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 DINOv3\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ud615 \ube44\uc804 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378, \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ub1cc\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 fMRI \ubc0f MEG\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ub85d\ub41c \uc778\uac04 \ub1cc\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, \uc804\uccb4 \ud45c\ud604 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131, \uc9c0\ud615\uc801 \uc870\uc9c1 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub454 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc644 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc73c\ub85c \ub1cc-\ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc591, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \uac01\uac01 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub1cc \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 DINOv3 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub420\uc218\ub85d \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \ub1cc \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, such an approach has yet\nto be explored within a multimodal context. Prior work has shown that, within a\nmultimodal setting, different modalities contain modality-unique information\nthat can complement information of other modalities. Leveraging on this, we\npropose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via\nthe following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance\nregularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance\non the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term,\nwhich ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the\ncovariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected\nattribute.

Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as\ncircuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation\nfor circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA\ndesigns. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA\ncircuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric\nfeatures. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of\neven higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial\nmodule-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance\nbottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design\nby leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels\nduring heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on\nEDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose\na parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by\nconcurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU\ninitialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our\nexperiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small,\nmedium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup\ncompared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively.

For simplicity, we use a tuned\ngradient-boosting model to furnish the anchor mean; however, any off-the-shelf\npoint regressor can serve as the anchor. The anchor prediction is projected\ninto a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and\na soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network\nexperts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive\nvariance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint\ncalibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point\naccuracy. On the theory side, assuming a H\\\"older smooth regression function of\norder~$\\alpha$ and fixed Lipschitz partition-of-unity weights with bounded\noverlap, we show that Anchor-MoE attains the minimax-optimal $L^2$ risk rate\n$O\\!\\big(N^{-2\\alpha/(2\\alpha+d)}\\big)$. In addition, the CRPS test\ngeneralization gap scales as\n$\\widetilde{O}\\!\\Big(\\sqrt{(\\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\\Big)$; it is logarithmic in $Mh$\nand scales as the square root in $P$ and $K$. Under bounded-overlap routing,\n$K$ can be replaced by $k$, and any dependence on a latent dimension is\nabsorbed into $P$. Under uniformly bounded means and variances, an analogous\n$\\widetilde{O}\\!\\big(\\sqrt{(\\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\\big)$ scaling holds for the test\nNLL up to constants. Empirically, across standard UCI regressions, Anchor-MoE\nconsistently matches or surpasses the strong NGBoost baseline in RMSE and NLL;\non several datasets it achieves new state-of-the-art probabilistic regression\nresults on our benchmark suite.

Unlike existing neural ODEs that\npredict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution\nand its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations\nfor mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates\nuncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by\nsolving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling\nstate-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation\nadapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled\nuncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations\nnaturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple\ndomains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification,\ntime-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust\ntrajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "UPN\uc740 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e0\uacbd \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc758 \uacc4\uc5f4\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "UPN\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubc0f \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0 \ub3d9\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc9c4\ud654\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud568\uaed8 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c UPN\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud750\ub984(CNF), \uc798 \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uac04\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21, \uc548\uc815\uc801 \ubc0f \ud63c\ub3c8 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "UPN\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \uc798 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e0\uacbd \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \uacc4\uc5f4\uc778 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc804\ud30c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(UPN)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd ODE\uac00 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uada4\uc801\ub9cc \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, UPN\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubc0f \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0 \ub3d9\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc9c4\ud654\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud30c\ud558\uba70, \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc0f \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\ud569\ub41c ODE\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d\ud654 \uc778\uacf5\ubb3c \uc5c6\uc774 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc758\uc874\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uc18d \uae4a\uc774 \uc218\uc2dd\uc740 \uac01 \uc785\ub825\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uba70 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 UPN\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud750\ub984(CNF), \uc798 \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uac04\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21, \uc548\uc815\uc801 \ubc0f \ud63c\ub3c8 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Code:\n  https://github.com/LeeJunHyun/NATR", "summary": "Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) hold a key position in machine\nlearning on graphs, but they struggle with unintended behaviors, such as\nover-smoothing and over-squashing, due to irregular data structures. The\nobservation and formulation of these limitations have become foundational in\nconstructing more informative graph representations. In this paper, we delve\ninto the limitations of MPNNs, focusing on aspects that have previously been\noverlooked. Our observations reveal that even within a single layer, the\ninformation specific to an individual node can become significantly diluted. To\ndelve into this phenomenon in depth, we present the concept of Over-dilution\nand formulate it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution for\nattribute-level and inter-node dilution for node-level representations. We also\nintroduce a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and\ncomplements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs. Our findings provide\nnew insights and contribute to the development of informative representations.\nThe implementation and supplementary materials are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/LeeJunHyun/NATR.", "AI": {"tldr": "MPNN\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc778 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud76c\uc11d\uacfc \ud76c\uc11d \uac15\ud654\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MPNN\uc758 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc758\ub3c4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud76c\uc11d \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud76c\uc11d \uc694\uc778, \uc989 \uc18d\uc131 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub178\ub4dc \ub0b4 \ud76c\uc11d \ubc0f \ub178\ub4dc \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub178\ub4dc \uac04 \ud76c\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub97c \uc218\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 MPNN\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub178\ub4dc \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e8\uc77c \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud76c\uc11d\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc778\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 MPNN\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \uc815\ubcf4\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\ub2ec \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(MPNNs)\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc704\uce58\ub97c \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud76c\uc11d \ubc0f \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc555\ucd95\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc758\ub3c4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\uc758 \uad00\ucc30 \ubc0f \uc218\uc2dd\ud654\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc11d\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MPNNs\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc2ec\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uac04\uacfc\ub418\uc5c8\ub358 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub454\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \ub2e8\uc77c \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ud2b9\uc815\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud76c\uc11d\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uae4a\uc774 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud76c\uc11d\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud76c\uc11d \uc694\uc778, \uc989 \uc18d\uc131 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub178\ub4dc \ub0b4 \ud76c\uc11d\uacfc \ub178\ub4dc \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub178\ub4dc \uac04 \ud76c\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud76c\uc11d\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 MPNNs\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub178\ub4dc \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70 \uc815\ubcf4\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\ud604 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc870 \uc790\ub8cc\ub294 https://github.com/LeeJunHyun/NATR\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac1c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4."}}

Despite significant advances in machine\nlearning-based quality prediction, current models exhibit critical limitations\nwhen confronted with the inherent distribution shifts that occur in dynamic\nmanufacturing environments. In this work, we extend the VQ-VAE Transformer\narchitecture - previously demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in weld\nquality prediction - by leveraging its autoregressive loss as a reliable\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanism. Our approach exhibits superior\nperformance compared to conventional reconstruction methods, embedding\nerror-based techniques, and other established baselines. By integrating OOD\ndetection with continual learning strategies, we optimize model adaptation,\ntriggering updates only when necessary and thereby minimizing costly labeling\nrequirements. We introduce a novel quantitative metric that simultaneously\nevaluates OOD detection capability while interpreting in-distribution\nperformance. Experimental validation in real-world welding scenarios\ndemonstrates that our framework effectively maintains robust quality prediction\ncapabilities across significant distribution shifts, addressing critical\nchallenges in dynamic manufacturing environments where process parameters\nfrequently change.

However, as a typical complex network,\ndata-driven deep learning is still in its infancy in describing and analyzing\nthe resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical\nframework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a\nphysically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary\ndynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to\nlearn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it\ninto the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical\ninformation method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics\nand spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain\nresilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better\nresults and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and\neffectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of\nthe industry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uccb4\uc778\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc775\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \uae30\ud638 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uccb4\uc778\uc774 \uad6d\uac00 \uacbd\uc81c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e4\uccb4\uc758 \ud65c\ub3d9 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ub2e4\uce35 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc9c4\ud654 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ud638 \uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uccb4\uc778\uc758 \ud0c4\ub825\uc131\uc744 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uccb4\uc778\uc740 \uad6d\uac00 \uacbd\uc81c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\uc11c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc544\uc9c1 \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8 \ud575\uc2ec\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc775\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \uae30\ud638 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud575\uc2ec \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e4\uccb4\uc758 \ud65c\ub3d9 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ub2e4\uce35 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc9c4\ud654 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ud638 \uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uccb4\uc778\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uace0 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uccb4\uc778\uc758 \ud0c4\ub825\uc131\uc744 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \uc77c\uc815\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4."}}

Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving\nPDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that\ndirectly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher\nrunning cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide\nmaterial design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead\nis amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a\nfocus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,\nHelmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we\npropose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.\nOur method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,\nwhich analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to\nits effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes\nand analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast\nExpansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels\nfrom structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave\npropagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful\nsensitivity information useful for material design.

In this\npaper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these\nchallenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised\nlearning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for\nlarge-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging.\nSecond, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial\nlayout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and\nenables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively\nbalance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent\nloss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At\nthe implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based\npost-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which\nenables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin,\nparticularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a\nscalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and\nefficient alternative to traditional approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubb34\uac10\ub3c5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb34\uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, pseudo coordinates\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uac04 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uad6c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6d4\ub4f1\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uce58 \ub9de\ucda4\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ucc98 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uc751 \uad00\uacc4\uc758 \ubd80\uc871, \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \ub178\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc131 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \uc694\uad6c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubb34\uac10\ub3c5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubb34\uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c, \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c \ucd94\ucd9c\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uac01 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uac04 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 pseudo coordinates\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uad6c\ubcc4\ub825\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0, \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ubd88\ubcc0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec, \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub9ce\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc88c\ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\ud604 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacb9\uce58\ub294 \uc601\uc5ed\uacfc \ub2e4\uc218\uacb0 \ud22c\ud45c\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ud0c0\uc77c \uae30\ubc18 \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\uacc4 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcd1\ub82c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub9e4\uce6d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc640 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450\uac01\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based\nclosures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these\nmodels. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training\ninputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs\noutside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic\nturbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ\nbetween three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based\nmethods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and\nStochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the\nexact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of\n$2.14 \\cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \\cdot 10^{-4}$.\nNext, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying\nout-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the\nbest in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the\nout-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and\nDE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE\nperforms the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We\nobserve that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP > DE > SV I >\nMCD. The DE results are relatively robust and provide intuitive UQ estimates,\ndespite performing naive ensembling. In terms of computational cost, the GP is\nsignificantly higher than the NN-based methods with a $O(n^3)$ computational\ncomplexity for each training step", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Existing\nacceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and\nbatch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a\nunified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies\nalong with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates\nthat dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and\ngradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher\nsparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3)\nMemory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to\nVRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel\nachieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage,\nwhile improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested\non CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with\nefficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns\nto allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision\ntraining, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint\nfrom 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with\ncustom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic\noptimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for\ndeployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates\nhow algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve\nscalability in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more efficient\nneural network training on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tri-Accel\uc740 GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc5f0\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac00\uc18d \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud568\uaed8 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 9.9% \ub2e8\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 13.3% \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 1.1% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525 \ub274\ub7f4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \uc5f0\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Tri-Accel\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac00\uc18d \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4: (1) \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \uc801\uc751 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8, (2) \ud76c\uc18c \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc2e0\ud638, (3) \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud0c4\ub825\uc801 \ubc30\uce58 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1.", "result": "CIFAR-10\uc5d0\uc11c Tri-Accel\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 9.9% \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 13.3% \ub0ae\ucd94\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c FP32 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 1.1% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uacfc \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud574 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \ub274\ub7f4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ube44\uc6a9 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac00\uc18d \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac00\uc18d \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Tri-Accel\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uace1\ub960 \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \uc801\uc751 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8; (2) \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud15d \ud06c\uae30 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud5e4\uc2dc\uc548/\ud53c\uc154 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c 2\ucc28 \uc2e0\ud638; (3) VRAM \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\uce58 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud0c4\ub825\uc801 \ubc30\uce58 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1.

While AI models have shown promise in this\ndomain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the\ninterpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the\ncomplexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with\nPopulation Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer\nfor Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs\npopulation coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to\ndynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under\nfairness and recall constraints. Embedded within the Modular Supervisory\nFramework for Spiking Network Training and Interpretation (MoSSTI), the system\nincorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically, saliency-based\nattribution and spike activity profiling, to increase transparency. Evaluated\non the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, our model achieves a $90.8\\%$\nrecall at a strict $5\\%$ false positive rate (FPR), outperforming\nstate-of-the-art spiking and non-spiking models while maintaining over $98\\%$\npredictive equality across key demographic attributes.

Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a fundamental cause of\nthe prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it\ncreates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic\ngeometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a\nsubspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs),\ninitializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our\napproach reduces dead features from 87\\% to below 1\\% in Attention Output SAEs\nwith 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning\nmethods.

Although recent works attempt to\noptimize data staleness by determining local data update frequency or client\nselection strategy, none of them explore taking both data staleness and data\nvolume into consideration. In this paper, we propose DUFL(Data Updating in\nFederated Learning), an incentive mechanism featuring an innovative local data\nupdate scheme manipulated by three knobs: the server's payment, outdated data\nconservation rate, and clients' fresh data collection volume, to coordinate\nstaleness and volume of local data for best utilities.

Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma\npersists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet\nthe exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of\nLLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be\nexplored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded\nReinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework\ndesigned to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning.\nSpecifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit\nscaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics\nare provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse\nhigh-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time,\nencouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2)\nverifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain\nrobust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL\non general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding\nreasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation.

We\nintroduce the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a null-calibrated metric that\nquantifies when a neuron's top activations decompose into semantically distinct\nclusters. PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric\ncluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary\nsemantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with\nTiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into\ncoherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers\nexhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach\nwith robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and\ncross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs.\nopen-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular,\naligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more\nthan non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls.

Yet, most prior work emphasizes designing reflective\nprompting strategies or reinforcement learning objectives, leaving the inner\nmechanisms of reflection underexplored. In this paper, we investigate\nreflection through the lens of latent directions in model activations. We\npropose a methodology based on activation steering to characterize how\ninstructions with different reflective intentions: no reflection, intrinsic\nreflection, and triggered reflection. By constructing steering vectors between\nthese reflection levels, we demonstrate that (1) new reflection-inducing\ninstructions can be systematically identified, (2) reflective behavior can be\ndirectly enhanced or suppressed through activation interventions, and (3)\nsuppressing reflection is considerably easier than stimulating it. Experiments\non GSM8k-adv with Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma3-4B reveal clear stratification across\nreflection levels, and steering interventions confirm the controllability of\nreflection.

In this problem, at each round $t$, the learner selects an\naction from a convex decision set, after which the adversary reveals a cost\nfunction $f_t$ and a resource consumption function $g_t$. The cost and\nconsumption functions are assumed to be $\\alpha$-approximately convex - a broad\nclass that generalizes convexity and encompasses many common non-convex\noptimization problems, including DR-submodular maximization, Online Vertex\nCover, and Regularized Phase Retrieval.

In this paper, we\npresent the first mechanistic exploration of the learned CARTRIDGE key-value\ncache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) CARTRIDGE keys act as\nstable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of\nthe learned compression occurs within the CARTRIDGE value vectors. We present\nempirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and\nmodel sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned CARTRIDGE key vectors\nbetween tasks with little performance loss.

This issue is particularly critical in\nindustrial automation, where trustworthy decision-making is essential.\nProbabilistic regression models address this challenge by modeling prediction\nuncertainty. However, many conventional methods assume a fixed-shape\ndistribution (typically Gaussian), and resort to estimating distribution\nparameters. This assumption is often restrictive, as real-world target\ndistributions can be highly complex. To overcome this limitation, we introduce\nTabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for\nunivariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like\nRealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow\nconsists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical\nfeature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature\nextraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and\ntractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark\ndatasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic\nregression models on likelihood scores. Our results demonstrate 9.64%\nimprovement compared to the strongest probabilistic regression model\n(TreeFlow), and on average 5.6 times speed-up in inference time compared to the\nstrongest deep learning alternative (NodeFlow). Additionally, we validate the\npractical applicability of TabResFlow in a real-world used car price prediction\ntask under selective regression. To measure performance in this setting, we\nintroduce a novel Area Under Risk Coverage (AURC) metric and show that\nTabResFlow achieves superior results across this metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tabular regression\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 TabResFlow\ub77c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c, \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "TabResFlow\ub294 \ub2e8\ubcc0\ub7c9 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ud68c\uadc0\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c Normalizing Spline Flow \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4: (1) \uac01 \uc218\uce58 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c MLP \uc778\ucf54\ub354, (2) \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc644\uc804 \uc5f0\uacb0 ResNet \ubc31\ubcf8, (3) \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc00\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc2a4\ud50c\ub77c\uc778 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud750\ub984.", "result": "TabResFlow\ub294 9\uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uac1c \ubca0\ud0c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, TreeFlow\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c 9.64%\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uace0, NodeFlow\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 5.6\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TabResFlow\ub294 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc911\uace0\ucc28 \uac00\uaca9 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubc94\uc704 \uc544\ub798 \uba74\uc801(AURC) \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud0c1\uc6d4\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ud68c\uadc0\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc798 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc810 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc790\uc2e0\uac10 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uace0\uc815 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec(\uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548)\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\ud3ec \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \uc885\uc885 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\ubcc0\ub7c9 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ud68c\uadc0\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c Normalizing Spline Flow \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 TabResFlow\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

On datasets of up to one billion samples, ComBI achieves\n0.90 precision with 4X-296X speed-ups over Multi-Index Hashing, and also\noutperforms Cellfishing.jl on single-cell RNA-seq searches with 2X-13X gains.\nBuilding on hashing structures, we propose Guided Random Forest (GRAF), a\ntree-based ensemble classifier that integrates global and local partitioning,\nbridging decision trees and boosting while reducing generalization error.\nAcross 115 datasets, GRAF delivers competitive or superior accuracy, and its\nunsupervised variant (uGRAF) supports guided hashing and importance sampling.\nWe show that GRAF and ComBI can be used to estimate per-sample classifiability,\nwhich enables scalable prediction of cancer patient survival. To address\nchallenges in interpreting mutations, we introduce Continuous Representation of\nCodon Switches (CRCS), a deep learning framework that embeds genetic changes\ninto numerical vectors. CRCS allows identification of somatic mutations without\nmatched normals, discovery of driver genes, and scoring of tumor mutations,\nwith survival prediction validated in bladder, liver, and brain cancers.\nTogether, these methods provide efficient, scalable, and interpretable tools\nfor large-scale data analysis and biomedical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc720\uc9c0 \ud574\uc2f1, \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \uc554 \uc720\uc804\uccb4\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc774\uc9c4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud2b8\ub9ac(BST)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud574\uc2f1 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Compressed BST of Inverted hash tables(ComBI)\uc640 Guided Random Forest(GRAF) \ubc0f Continuous Representation of Codon Switches(CRCS)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ComBI\ub294 Multi-Index Hashing\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 4\ubc30\uc5d0\uc11c 296\ubc30 \ube60\ub978 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c 0.90\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, GRAF\ub294 115\uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc0dd\ubb3c\uc758\ud559\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc720\uc9c0 \ud574\uc2f1, \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \uc554 \uc720\uc804\uccb4\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\ud560 \uae30\ubc18 \ud574\uc2f1\uc740 \uc774\uc9c4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud2b8\ub9ac(BST)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801 \uc131\uc7a5\uacfc \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \uc800\ud574 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Compressed BST of Inverted hash tables(ComBI)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc904\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ube60\ub978 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd5c\uadfc\uc811 \uc774\uc6c3 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\ub300 10\uc5b5 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c ComBI\ub294 Multi-Index Hashing\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 4\ubc30\uc5d0\uc11c 296\ubc30 \ube60\ub978 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c 0.90\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc138\ud3ec RNA-seq \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c Cellfishing.jl\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub3c4 2\ubc30\uc5d0\uc11c 13\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud574\uc2f1 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\uc5ed \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc5ed \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud2b8\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubd84\ub958\uae30(Guided Random Forest, GRAF)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uc640 \ubd80\uc2a4\ud305\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. 115\uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c GRAF\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\uac70\ub098 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 variant(uGRAF)\ub294 guided hashing \ubc0f \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, their\npredictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their\nadoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new\nuncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines\ngraph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our\nmethod is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a\nprobabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is\nconditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation\nmatrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the\nrationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient\nmodel training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the\nwell known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

In particular, we\nonly assume Lipschitz smoothness of the average loss function of the honest\nworkers, in contrast to [29]that additionally assumes a special smoothness of\nbounded global Hessian variance.

These algorithms identify\nclusters in high-density regions while treating sparser areas as noise.\nHowever, reliance on user-defined parameters often poses optimization\nchallenges that require domain expertise. This paper presents a novel\ndensity-based clustering method inspired by the concept of selective attention,\nwhich minimizes the need for user-defined parameters under standard conditions.\nInitially, the algorithm operates without requiring user-defined parameters.

Includes appendix and supplementary discussion", "summary": "This paper considers a finite-sum optimization problem under first-order\nqueries and investigates the benefits of strategic querying on stochastic\ngradient-based methods compared to uniform querying strategy. We first\nintroduce Oracle Gradient Querying (OGQ), an idealized algorithm that selects\none user's gradient yielding the largest possible expected improvement (EI) at\neach step. However, OGQ assumes oracle access to the gradients of all users to\nmake such a selection, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address\nthis limitation, we propose Strategic Gradient Querying (SGQ), a practical\nalgorithm that has better transient-state performance than SGD while making\nonly one query per iteration. For smooth objective functions satisfying the\nPolyak-Lojasiewicz condition, we show that under the assumption of EI\nheterogeneity, OGQ enhances transient-state performance and reduces\nsteady-state variance, while SGQ improves transient-state performance over SGD.\nOur numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc77c\ucc28 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc720\ud55c\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud574 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucffc\ub9ac\uac00 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc778 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Oracle Gradient Querying (OGQ)\uc640 Strategic Gradient Querying (SGQ) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "OGQ\ub294 \uc804\uc774 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc548\uc815 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70, SGQ\ub294 SGD\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc804\uc774 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc720\ud55c\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0, \uade0\uc77c \ucffc\ub9ac \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, \uac01 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 \uae30\ub300 \uac1c\uc120(EI)\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1\ud654\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 Oracle Gradient Querying(OGQ)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 OGQ\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \ubc18\ubcf5\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub9cc \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba74\uc11c SGD\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc804\uc774 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub354 \uc88b\uc740 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 Strategic Gradient Querying(SGQ)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Traditional graph neural\nnetworks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to\ntheir local structure.

Recent work shows that adversaries can\nexploit access to these APIs to bypass model safety mechanisms by encoding\nharmful content in seemingly harmless fine-tuning data, evading both human\nmonitoring and standard content filters. We formalize the fine-tuning API\ndefense problem, and introduce the Cipher Fine-tuning Robustness benchmark\n(CIFR), a benchmark for evaluating defense strategies' ability to retain model\nsafety in the face of cipher-enabled attackers while achieving the desired\nlevel of fine-tuning functionality. We include diverse cipher encodings and\nfamilies, with some kept exclusively in the test set to evaluate for\ngeneralization across unseen ciphers and cipher families. We then evaluate\ndifferent defenses on the benchmark and train probe monitors on model internal\nactivations from multiple fine-tunes. We show that probe monitors achieve over\n99% detection accuracy, generalize to unseen cipher variants and families, and\ncompare favorably to state-of-the-art monitoring approaches.

Contemporary OOD algorithms using geometry projection can detect\nOOD or adversarial samples from clean in-distribution (ID) samples. However,\nthis setting regards adversarial ID samples as OOD, leading to incorrect OOD\npredictions. Existing efforts on OOD detection with ID and OOD data under\nattacks are minimal. In this paper, we develop a robust OOD detection method\nthat distinguishes adversarial ID samples from OOD ones. The sharp loss\nlandscape created by adversarial training hinders model convergence, impacting\nthe latent embedding quality for OOD score calculation. Therefore, we introduce\na {\\bf Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)} framework to smooth out the\nrugged adversarial loss landscape in the projected latent geometry. Enhanced\ngeometric embedding convergence enables accurate ID data characterization,\nbenefiting OOD detection against adversarial attacks.

The learning objective of these masks\nis derived by desiderata of unlearning and optimized through an efficient\nalgorithm featured by a greedy search with a warm start. Extensive experiments\non various Transformer models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of {\\tt MAPE-Unlearn} for unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70\ub97c \uc704\ud55c MAPE-Unlearn \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uaddc\uc81c\ub97c \uc900\uc218\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "MAPE-Unlearn\uc740 Transformer\uc758 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc640 \ud544\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uc30d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \uc778\uc2dd \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 MAPE-Unlearn\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c MAPE-Unlearn\uc740 Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Transformer\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11cremarkable\ud55c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub454 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uaddc\uc815\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub454 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uc548\ub418\uc5b4 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 Transformer\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Transformer\uc758 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc640 \ud544\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc9c0\ubaa9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uc30d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \uc778\uc2dd \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 MAPE-Unlearn\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70\uc758 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud55c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub418\uba70, \ub530\ub73b\ud55c \uc2dc\uc791\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc9c0\uc6cc\uc9c4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc81c\uac70\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c MAPE-Unlearn\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

The intuition is that, although the\nparameter count is enormous, the functional dimensionality of attention is\noften much lower. I show that this quantity leads to a generalization bound\nwhose dependence on sample size matches empirical scaling laws observed in\nlarge language models, up to logarithmic factors.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces,\nwhile Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent\nadvances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via\nexplicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a\nGNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link\nprediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by\nLRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these\ntasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages\ntask-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs.\nExperiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in\nzero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work\nhighlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides\nnew resources for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "GNN\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud480\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, LRMs\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958, \ub9c1\ud06c \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958, \ub9c1\ud06c \uc608\uce21, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 GNN \ube44\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Graph-R1\uc740 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRM)\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uae34 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ub300\uc548 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GNN\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc791\uc5c5\uc778 \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958, \ub9c1\ud06c \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c LRM\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ub418\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ud754\uc801\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc120\ud615\ud654\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc7ac\uace0 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Graph-R1\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, Graph-R1\uc774 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Inappropriate curvatures may\ncause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance.\nSo far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not\nbeen developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of\nHNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via\ntheir effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived\nbound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the\nloss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,\n  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized\nthrough a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit\ndifferentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by\napproximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and\nconvergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation\nerror is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding\ngradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from\nlong-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our\nmethod can improve the performance of HNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace1\ub960\uc774 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(HNN)\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uace1\ub960 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec HNN\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace1\ub960\uc758 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud1a0\ub300\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PAC-\ubca0\uc774\uc988 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacbd\uacc4 \ub3c4\ucd9c, \uace1\ub960\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc190\uc2e4 \uacbd\uad00\uc758 \ud3c9\ud65c\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \uace1\ub960 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac \uc624\ucc28\uc640 \uc218\ub834 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 HNN\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub428\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uace1\ub960\uc774 HNN\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(HNNs)\uc740 \uc74c\uc218 \uace1\ub960\ub85c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9c0\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\ub294 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace1\ub960\uc740 HNN \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \uace1\ub960\uc740 HNN\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uae4c\uc9c0 HNN\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uace1\ub960\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc740 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 HNN\uc758 PAC-\ubca0\uc774esian \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc190\uc2e4 \uacbd\uad00\uc758 \ud3c9\ud65c\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uace1\ub960\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c, \uc190\uc2e4 \uacbd\uad00\uc744 \ud3c9\ud65c\ud654\ud558\uc5ec HNN\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \uace1\ub960 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace1\ub960\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc94\uc704 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc911 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uace1\ub960\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc911 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac \uc624\ucc28\uc640 \uc218\ub834 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadfc\uc0ac \uc624\ucc28\uac00 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uace0, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 HNN\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uacbd\uacc4 \uc9c0\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc218\ub834\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\ub958, \uae34 \uaf2c\ub9ac \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5, \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5, \uc18c\uc218 \uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 HNN\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While sparse-dictionary\nlearning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation\npatching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which\nfeatures flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding\nthis dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection\nof model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation\nTransport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals\n$k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder\nprojections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine\nwhether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or\nsynthesised from non-linear layer computation.

In\nparticular, for any algorithm implementable by a fixed-weight attention head\n(e.g. one-step gradient descent or linear/ridge regression), there exists a\nprompt that drives a two-layer softmax attention module to reproduce the\nalgorithm's output with arbitrary precision. This guarantee extends even to a\nsingle-head attention layer (using longer prompts if necessary), achieving\narchitectural minimality. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an\nalgorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product\ngaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation.

The acquisition and\nlabeling of echocardiograms (echo) for heart assessment, crucial in\npoint-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) settings, often encounter limitations due to\nthe restricted number of echo views available, typically captured by operators\nwith varying levels of experience. This study proposes a novel approach for\nenhancing clinical diagnosis accuracy by synthetically generating echo views.\nThese views are conditioned on existing, real views of the heart, focusing\nspecifically on the estimation of ejection fraction (EF), a critical parameter\ntraditionally measured from biplane apical views. By integrating a conditional\ngenerative model, we demonstrate an improvement in EF estimation accuracy,\nproviding a comparative analysis with traditional methods. Preliminary results\nindicate that our synthetic echoes, when used to augment existing datasets, not\nonly enhance EF estimation but also show potential in advancing the development\nof more robust, accurate, and clinically relevant ML models.

However,\ncomputational overheads become prohibitively large when AT is applied to large\nbackbone models. AT is also known to have the issue of robust overfitting. This\npaper contributes to solving both problems simultaneously towards building more\ntrustworthy foundation models. In particular, we propose a new adapter-based\napproach for efficient AT directly in the feature space.

We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable\nprobe of constructive scientific discovery. The idea is to systematically\nremove a target result together with its forget-closure (supporting lemmas,\nparaphrases, and multi-hop entailments) and then evaluate whether the model can\nre-derive the result from only permitted axioms and tools. Success would\nindicate generative capability beyond recall; failure would expose current\nlimits. Unlike prevailing motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or\nsafety-our framing repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We\noutline a minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms to illustrate\nfeasibility, and sketch how the same approach could later be extended to\ndomains such as physics or chemistry. This is a position paper: our\ncontribution is conceptual and methodological, not empirical.

However, tuning\nlarge models has become increasingly resource-intensive and may have difficulty\nensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding\n(SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired\nsafety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a\nsmall language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates\nspeculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the\nsmall and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to\ndynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to\nhandle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then\nsampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original\nand the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips\nthe large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to\nremain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference\ntime, thanks to the speculative sampling design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95, \uc989 Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding (SSD)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac00\uce58\uc640 \uc548\uc804 \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0 \ubd80\ud569\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub178\ub825\ud588\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SSD\ub294 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc911\uc5d0 \ucd94\uce21 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc18c\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ubcf5\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uce58 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud0c8\uc625 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SSD\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uace0, \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc751\ub2f5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SSD\ub294 \ucd94\uce21 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc124\uacc4 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac00\uce58\uc640 \uc548\uc804 \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ub178\ub825\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubc29\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874 LLM\uc5d0 \ucd94\uac00 \uc548\uc804 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc870\uc815\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc18c\ubaa8\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uba70 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc5d0 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding(SSD)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Many advanced multimodal methods focus\non capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which\ncan inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared\nacross modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent\nvariables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various\ntasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However,\nmultimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational\nposteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses\nthese challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a\nsecond-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective\ninference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the\nquality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively\nacross multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis\nquality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales\nto many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in\ncapturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uc720 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ub3d9\uae30\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc785\ub825\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ubcc4 \uc138\ubd80\uc0ac\ud56d \uc870\ud569\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud588\uc73c\ub098, \uadf8\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacf5\uc720\ub418\ub294 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc758\ubbf8 \uac1c\ub150\uc774 obscured \ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc 2\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud45c\ud604\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0 \uc0ac\uc804(prior)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc720 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud569\uc131\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ShaLa\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc VAE\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ud569\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ShaLa\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc VAE\uac00 \uacf5\uc720 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubd80\uc871\ud588\ub358 \ubc18\uba74, \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uc720 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uace0\uae09 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \uac04\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc815 \uc138\ubd80 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uac04\uc5d0 \uacf5\uc720\ub418\ub294 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc758\ubbf8 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc228\uae30\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc VAE\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4, \uacb0\ud569 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud569\uc131\uacfc \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc VAE\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ubcc4 \ud6c4\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0, \ub0ae\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \ud569\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uace0\ud1b5\ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c ShaLa\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc 2\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud45c\ud604\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0 \uc0ac\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uc720 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud569\uc131\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ShaLa\ub97c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc VAE\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ud569\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, ShaLa\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc VAE\uac00 \uacf5\uc720 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubd80\uc871\ud588\ub358 \ubc18\uba74, \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Through\nexperiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our\ntheoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.\nNotably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the\nmodel's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging\ntoward a uniform selection pattern.

Jones"], "title": "Limits of message passing for node classification: How class-bottlenecks restrict signal-to-noise ratio", "comment": null, "summary": "Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node\nclassification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low\nsame-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a\nunifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily\nand bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN\nrepresentations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent\nparameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity\nto class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation\nof classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low\nhigher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural\nbottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph\nensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking\ninto underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and\noversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with\nclosed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising\nhigher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and\ntwo-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based\nrewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across\nall homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on\nreal-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs\ntypically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the\nliterature.

The technical report for the paper titled \"Effective\n  Clustering for Large Multi-Relational Graphs\" in SIGMOD 2026", "summary": "Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling\ndiverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade\nextensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning\nthe node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in\nanalyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the\nmajority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised\nresult quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and\nattributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and\nbillions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning\nmodels.\n  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to\naddress the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel\ntwo-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive\nhigh-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet\nenergy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of\nclustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves\nsignificantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM\nthrough a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions\ninclude (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node\nfeature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with\ncarefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without\nexplicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix.

This paper is accepted by ICONIP 2025\n  but not published", "summary": "Accurate air quality prediction is becoming increasingly important in the\nenvironmental field. To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow\nreal-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results,\nwe propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method\n(Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior.\nThe model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set\ncomprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network\nto extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex\nair quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between\ndifferent monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning\nmodule, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven\nmanner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing\nthe spatial relationships between monitoring points.

A core\nlimitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the\nunexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or\nBayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture\nwhether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce\nMutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not\nas anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the\nimpact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems\nto reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test\nsequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and\npropose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically\ngoverns system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking.\nEmpirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map\nestimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform\nclassical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and\npredictive accuracy.

The QNN architecture\nsignificantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time\nonboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high\naccuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and\nDigital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive\nWeighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and\nreliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach\nenhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes.

Meanwhile, leveraging\ntree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression\nEdit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial\ncredit and yields a more accurate assessment of similarity between prediction\nand ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach\nonly 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a\nsignificant capability gap, especially for this practical and frontier domain\nrelative to traditional physics.

In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a\nself-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a\ntree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and\nfixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant\nadditional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and\npruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update\ncompute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key\ncontributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates\nthe KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along\nwith an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage\nestimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.\nand (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic\ndivergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain\nof TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours\nfrom 22\\% up to 43\\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile\nshowing up to 40\\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\\% at token-level\nsampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of\ninference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based\npost-training with fewer samples and less compute.

Classical\napproaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently\nlack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for\neach system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has\ninspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling\nalgorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on\na single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to\ntransfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of\nscalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million\nparameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide\nmolecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length.

While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated\npromising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters\nunder dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage\nmethod that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo,\nand switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple\nlightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and\nmerge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time.\nAdaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance\ncomputation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays.\nSwitch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient\naccumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits.\nTogether, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system\nefficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of\ncommunications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our\nmethod.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub97c \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \ud6c8\ub828(MIT), \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubc30\uce58 DiLoCo \ubc0f \uc2a4\uc704\uce58 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc218\ub97c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud601\uc2e0\ub4e4\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0\uacfc \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0, \uc790\uc6d0\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc790\uc6d0\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, traditional heuristics for branching\noften fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing\nlearning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence\non expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with\nlimitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To\naddress these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that\nconstructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences\nbetween branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along\nsearch-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from\ncomplete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching\nprocess. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward\nredistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense\nstepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive\nexperiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch\noutperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP\niterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances.

Unlike conventional localization techniques that\nsearch the solution over a whole set of matrices, the proposed technique\nrestricts the search to the set of Euclidean distance matrices. Specifically,\nwe express D as a function of the sensor coordinate matrix X that inherently\nsatisfies the unique properties of D, and then jointly recover D and X using a\ndeep neural network. To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse\nmatrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We\nthen solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L.

To address these challenges and\nfully harness the benefits of MoE, a systematic evaluation of hardware\nacceleration techniques is essential. We present MoE-Inference-Bench, a\ncomprehensive study to evaluate MoE performance across diverse scenarios. We\nanalyze the impact of batch size, sequence length, and critical MoE\nhyperparameters such as FFN dimensions and number of experts on throughput.

Given an incomplete\nprocess instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining\ntime are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have\nshown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of\nthese models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical\npatterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on\nso-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process\nparticipants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions\nthat mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process\ninstance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in\nthe same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment\ndecisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient\nshould not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic\napproach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business\nprocess monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both\nfairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to\ndifferentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a\ndecision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results\nshow that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness\nand accuracy in the presence of biased data.

We then analyze the distribution of selected configurations\nto better understand DLN training dynamics. We evaluate our approach on 51\npublicly available univariate TSC benchmarks.

While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are\nincreasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE\nmodels typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting\nloss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful\nrouting/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we\npropose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for\nunivariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and\nshort-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines\nsparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that\nreplaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical\nevaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced\nexpert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring\nthe auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE\nimplementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a\nfraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models,\nsuch as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that\nour MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally\nefficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling\ncost-effective inference.

Our approach integrates a delay-aware neural architecture, a\nnumerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse\nsequences.

Recent findings suggest that\nperformance is more closely tied to the consistency of neighborhood class\ndistributions. We demonstrate that the MPNN performance depends on the number\nof components of the overall neighborhood distribution within a class. By\nbreaking down the classes into their neighborhood distribution components, we\nincrease measures of neighborhood distribution informativeness but do not\nobserve an improvement in MPNN performance. We propose a Gumbel-Softmax-based\nrewiring method that reduces deviations in neighborhood distributions. Our\nresults show that our new method enhances neighborhood informativeness, handles\nlong-range dependencies, mitigates oversquashing, and increases the\nclassification performance of the MPNN.

Hu et al and Liu et al introduce Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) as highly\nefficient and performant solutions to the computational challenges of LLM\nfine-tuning, demonstrating huge speedups and memory usage savings for models\nsuch as GPT-3 and RoBERTa. We seek to expand upon the original LoRA and DoRA\npapers by benchmarking efficiency and performance of LoRA and DoRA when applied\nto a much smaller scale of language model: our case study here is the compact\nminBERT model. Our findings reveal that optimal custom configurations of LoRA\nand DoRA, coupled with Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), significantly enhance\ntraining efficiency without compromising performance. Furthermore, while the\nparameterization of minBERT is significantly smaller than GPT-3, our results\nvalidate the observation that gradient updates to language models are\ninherently low-rank even in small model space, observing that rank 1\ndecompositions yield negligible performance deficits. Furthermore, aided by our\nhighly efficient minBERT implementation, we investigate numerous architectures,\ncustom loss functions, and hyperparameters to ultimately train an optimal\nensembled multitask minBERT model to simultaneously perform sentiment analysis,\nparaphrase detection, and similarity scoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LoRA \ubc0f DoRA \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc791\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 minBERT\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub192\uc544, \uc791\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud300\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "LoRA\uc640 DoRA\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec minBERT \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uace0, \uc790\ub3d9 \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4(AMP)\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "LoRA\uc640 DoRA\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uad6c\uc131\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 minBERT \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d, \ud328\ub7ec\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc988 \uac80\ucd9c \ubc0f \uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac70\ub300 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc73c\ub098, LLM\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc740 \uadf9\ub3c4\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uba70, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c GPU \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uae30\uc5c5\uacfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ud300\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4.

This task faces two major challenges: limited data diversity\nand insufficient maintenance of visual consistency between generated and\noriginal charts during training. Existing datasets mainly rely on seed data to\nprompt GPT models for code generation, resulting in homogeneous samples. To\naddress this, we propose ReChartPrompt, which leverages real-world,\nhuman-designed charts from arXiv papers as prompts instead of synthetic seeds.\nUsing the diverse styles and rich content of arXiv charts, we construct\nReChartPrompt-240K, a large-scale and highly diverse dataset. Another challenge\nis that although SFT effectively improve code understanding, it often fails to\nensure that generated charts are visually consistent with the originals. To\naddress this, we propose ChartSimRL, a GRPO-based reinforcement learning\nalgorithm guided by a novel chart similarity reward. This reward consists of\nattribute similarity, which measures the overlap of chart attributes such as\nlayout and color between the generated and original charts, and visual\nsimilarity, which assesses similarity in texture and other overall visual\nfeatures using convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional text-based\nrewards such as accuracy or format rewards, our reward considers the multimodal\nnature of the chart-to-code task and effectively enhances the model's ability\nto accurately reproduce charts. By integrating ReChartPrompt and ChartSimRL, we\ndevelop the ChartMaster model, which achieves state-of-the-art results among\n7B-parameter models and even rivals GPT-4o on various chart-to-code generation\nbenchmarks.

At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with\namplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions.\nDistinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each\nhead, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate\nmultiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter\nsharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model\ncomplexity.

We consider cases where co-occurrence\nprobabilities are measured between pairs of elements from heterogeneous\ndomains. The proposed method maps these heterogeneous elements into\ncorresponding two-dimensional latent spaces, enabling visualization of\nasymmetric relationships between the domains. The key idea is to embed the\nelements in a way that maximizes their mutual information, thereby preserving\nthe original dependency structure as much as possible.

Hence, developing new cognitive tests based\non novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available\nnormative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming,\nand infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements\nin generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to\ngenerate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We\ninvestigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and\nGPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established\nimage-based cognitive assessments, such as the \"Cookie Theft\" picture\ndescription task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic\ninstructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were\nevaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to\ndistinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics\nincluded BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced\nprompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively\ndistinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity\ncompared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting\nhigher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for\ncontextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating\ncreative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary\nvalidation results.

However, a static mixing strategy is\nsuboptimal, as the model's learning preferences for various data domains shift\ndynamically throughout training. Crucially, observing these evolving\npreferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant\nchallenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically\nadjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX\nintroduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of\ndata domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data\nmixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution.\nWe solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and\nTiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We\ntrained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion\ntokens.

A practically relevant theoretical\nunderstanding of this interplay between memorization and generalization may\nsignificantly impact real-world deployments of diffusion models with respect to\nissues such as copyright infringement and data privacy. In this work, to\ndisentangle the different factors that influence memorization and\ngeneralization in practical diffusion models, we introduce a scientific and\nmathematical \"laboratory\" for investigating these phenomena in diffusion models\ntrained on fully synthetic or natural image-like structured data. Within this\nsetting, we hypothesize that the memorization or generalization behavior of an\nunderparameterized trained model is determined by the difference in training\nloss between an associated memorizing model and a generalizing model. To probe\nthis hypothesis, we theoretically characterize a crossover point wherein the\nweighted training loss of a fully generalizing model becomes greater than that\nof an underparameterized memorizing model at a critical value of model\n(under)parameterization. We then demonstrate via carefully-designed experiments\nthat the location of this crossover predicts a phase transition in diffusion\nmodels trained via gradient descent, validating our hypothesis.

Yang"], "title": "Rethinking Federated Learning Over the Air: The Blessing of Scaling Up", "comment": null, "summary": "Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple\nclients while preserving data privacy. However, its performance is often\nconstrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems\nsupporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating\nover-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising\nsolution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly\nincreases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by\ntransmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital\nones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced\ndistortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global\nparameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical\nframework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in\nlarge-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of\nscaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The\nmutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's\naggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)\nMitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the\nimpact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved\nConvergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the\nconvergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a\nviable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of\nclients.

We consistently observe across 6\nstate-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing\nup to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance,\nless than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of\nusing smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text\nencoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested\nin prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation\nspace. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions\nactually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why,\non average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a\nmarginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the\nembeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on\ngenerative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to\nclassification or retrieval tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc798\ub77c\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud558\uc704 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc798\ub77c\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc65c \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "6\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc640 26\uac1c\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \ucd5c\ub300 50%\ub97c \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uad00\ucc30.", "result": "\uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 50%\ub97c \uc81c\uc678\ud574\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uac00 10% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba70, \uc81c\uac70\ub41c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac.", "conclusion": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc74c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc798\ub77c\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud558\uc704 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 6\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc640 26\uac1c\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c, \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \ucd5c\ub300 50%\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 10% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub9cc \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uad00\ucc30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \ud06c\uae30\uc758 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uacfc \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc14\uc640\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc774\uac83\uc774 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc544\ub2d8\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ud788\ub824,\uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub41c \ub9ce\uc740 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\uac70 \uc2dc \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc74c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc798\ub77c\ub0bc \ub54c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ubd84\ub958 \ub610\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

MANGO\ndecomposes complex tasks into multiple layers of abstraction, where each layer\ndefines an abstract state space and employs options to modularize trajectories\ninto macro-actions. These options are nested across layers, allowing for\nefficient reuse of learned movements and improved sample efficiency. The\nframework introduces intra-layer policies that guide the agent's transitions\nwithin the abstract state space, and task actions that integrate task-specific\ncomponents such as reward functions. Experiments conducted in\nprocedurally-generated grid environments demonstrate substantial improvements\nin both sample efficiency and generalization capabilities compared to standard\nRL methods.

To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based\nframework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel\ntraining-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide\nrange of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly\nreducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen\nincorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that\naccelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps\nand spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided,\ncommunication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized\nlatency.

This property, commonly\nreferred to as calibration, is essential for risk-aware decision-making. In\nregression a wide variety of calibration metrics and recalibration methods have\nemerged. However, these metrics differ significantly in their definitions,\nassumptions and scales, making it difficult to interpret and compare results\nacross studies. Moreover, most recalibration methods have been evaluated using\nonly a small subset of metrics, leaving it unclear whether improvements\ngeneralize across different notions of calibration. In this work, we\nsystematically extract and categorize regression calibration metrics from the\nliterature and benchmark these metrics independently of specific modelling\nmethods or recalibration approaches. Through controlled experiments with\nreal-world, synthetic and artificially miscalibrated data, we demonstrate that\ncalibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results. Our analysis\nreveals substantial inconsistencies: many metrics disagree in their evaluation\nof the same recalibration result, and some even indicate contradictory\nconclusions. This inconsistency is particularly concerning as it potentially\nallows cherry-picking of metrics to create misleading impressions of success.\nWe identify the Expected Normalized Calibration Error (ENCE) and the Coverage\nWidth-based Criterion (CWC) as the most dependable metrics in our tests.

To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning\nnetworks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple\nsubgraphs. Our approach incorporates three different types of chromosomes for\npartition/mapping/priority exploration, and leverages device-in-the-loop\nprofiling and evaluation for accurate execution time estimation. Based on this\nmethodology, our system, Puzzle, demonstrates superior performance in extensive\nevaluations with randomly generated scenarios involving nine state-of-the-art\nnetworks. The results demonstrate Puzzle can support 3.7 and 2.2 times higher\nrequest frequency on average compared to the two heuristic baselines, NPU Only\nand Best Mapping, respectively, while satisfying the equivalent level of\nreal-time requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd

The consequences of incorrectly annotated\ndata include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower\noverall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often\nfocus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of\ndataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise\nannotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this\nwork, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting\nlabel errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance\nsegmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label\nerrors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label\nerrors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all\nmentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on\na composite input.

However, deploying SemCom over digital\nsystems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against\ntransmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature\nimputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial\nerror concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature\ndistortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a\nproperty crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the\nsubsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a\ngenerative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to\nefficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we\ndevelop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error\nprotection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic\nimportance of each packet.

Usually, approaches to\nuncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights\ncannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss\nfunctions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very\ngeneral definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even\ngenerative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that\nconnect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration\nwith proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We\nachieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly\nproper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the\nkernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based\ngenerative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language\ngeneration. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large\nlanguage models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we\ngeneralize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which\nmotivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a\nnovel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel\nrisk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration\nerrors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another\nkernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable\nevaluation of generative image models.", "AI":

This study aims to\nidentify and isolate the components of two different adversarial training\ntechniques that contribute most to increased adversarial robustness,\nparticularly through the lens of margins in the input space -- the minimal\ndistance between data points and decision boundaries. Specifically, we compare\ntwo methods that maximize margins: a simple approach which modifies the loss\nfunction to increase an approximation of the margin, and a more complex\nstate-of-the-art method (Dynamics-Aware Robust Training) which builds upon this\napproach. Using a VGG-16 model as our base, we systematically isolate and\nevaluate individual components from these methods to determine their relative\nimpact on adversarial robustness. We assess the effect of each component on the\nmodel's performance under various adversarial attacks, including AutoAttack and\nProjected Gradient Descent (PGD).

Traditional DP\napproaches often require adding noise based solely on private data, which can\nsignificantly degrade utility. In this paper, we address this limitation in the\ncontext of the ordinary least squares estimator (OLSE) of linear regression\nbased on sufficient statistics perturbation (SSP) under the unbounded data\nassumption.

Recent advancements in statistics\nand machine learning have increasingly addressed this problem for data residing\non Riemannian manifolds. One prominent strategy involves monitoring abrupt\nchanges in the center of mass of the time series. Implemented in a streaming\nfashion, this strategy, however, requires careful step size tuning when\ncomputing the updates of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose to\nleverage robust centroid on manifolds from M-estimation theory to address this\nissue. Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical\nKarcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function\n(robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic\nwhose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method.

These architectures\nhave inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop\naggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce\nsignificant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In\nresponse to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture\nthat leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach\nincorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and\nGlobal Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational\nefficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size,\nadjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations\nusing challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train\nover 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters.

In\nthis work, we address FL settings where clients may behave adversarially,\nexhibiting Byzantine attacks, while the central server is trusted and equipped\nwith a reference dataset. We propose FedGreed, a resilient aggregation strategy\nfor federated learning that does not require any assumptions about the fraction\nof adversarial participants. FedGreed orders clients' local model updates based\non their loss metrics evaluated against a trusted dataset on the server and\ngreedily selects a subset of clients whose models exhibit the minimal\nevaluation loss. Unlike many existing approaches, our method is designed to\noperate reliably under heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions, which are\nprevalent in real-world deployments.

However, GNSS are highly vulnerable\nto spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead\nreceivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected\nnavigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most\nexisting spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques\nand struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this\nlimitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid\nQuantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS\nsignals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted\nduring the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT\nsolutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS\nreceivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,\nwhere attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time\ncomputations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen\ntime-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and\nsophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently\noutperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based\nmodels, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day,\nunseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy\nof 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs\nbut is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an\naccuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%.

While traditional inference\nmethods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world\napplications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise\nwith unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in\nflow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on\nconditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To\nenable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use\nsimulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step\nof the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates\nconverge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite\nobservations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining\nEM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac00\ubc95 \ubc0f \uacf1\ubc95 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc131\ubd84\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 EM \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\ubc29 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub7ec\uc640 \uc7a1\uc74c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud654\ud559 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc7a1\uc74c \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c EM \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing Echo State Networks (ESNs)\nmitigate this growth but employ reservoirs whose Euclidean geometry is\nmismatched to the stretch-and-fold structure of chaos. We introduce the\nHyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER), an ESN whose neurons are sampled in the\nPoincare ball and whose connections decay exponentially with hyperbolic\ndistance. This negative-curvature construction embeds an exponential metric\ndirectly into the latent space, aligning the reservoir's local\nexpansion-contraction spectrum with the system's Lyapunov directions while\npreserving standard ESN features such as sparsity, leaky integration, and\nspectral-radius control. Training is limited to a Tikhonov-regularized readout.\nOn the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Roessler systems, and the hyperchaotic Chen-Ueta\nattractor, HypER consistently lengthens the mean valid-prediction horizon\nbeyond Euclidean and graph-structured ESN baselines, with statistically\nsignificant gains confirmed over 30 independent runs; parallel results on\nreal-world benchmarks, including heart-rate variability from the Santa Fe and\nMIT-BIH datasets and international sunspot numbers, corroborate its advantage.\nWe further establish a lower bound on the rate of state divergence for HypER,\nmirroring Lyapunov growth.", "AI": {"tldr": "HypER \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud63c\ub3c8 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud63c\ub3c8 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub9ac\uc544\ud478\ub178\ud504 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc774 \uc30d\uace1\uc120 \uac70\ub9ac\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 Poincare \ubcfc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \ub274\ub7f0\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "HypER\ub294 Euclidean \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 ESN \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uade0 \uc720\ud6a8 \uc608\uce21 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc800\ud76c\ub294 HypER\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc1c\uc0b0 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub9ac\uc544\ud478\ub178\ud504 \uc131\uc7a5\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ac\uc548\ud478\ub178\ud504 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud63c\ub3c8 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5d0\ucf54 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(ESN)\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud63c\ub3c8\uc758 \ub298\ub9bc-\uc811\uae30 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ub9de\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc758 \uc800\uc218\uc870\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud3ec\uc575\uce74\ub808 \ubcfc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \ub274\ub7f0\uacfc \uc30d\uace1\uc120 \uac70\ub9ac\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 ESN\uc778 Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir(HypER)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc74c\uace1\ub960 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uc9c0\ud45c \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\uc218\uc870\uc758 \uad6d\uc18c\uc801 \ud655\uc7a5-\uc218\ucd95 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc744 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub9ac\uc548\ud478\ub178\ud504 \ubc29\ud5a5\uacfc \uc815\ub82c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \ud76c\uc18c\uc131, \ub204\uc218 \ud1b5\ud569, \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ubc18\uacbd \uc81c\uc5b4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 ESN \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 Tikhonov \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ud310\ub3c5\uc74c\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud63c\ub3c8 \ub85c\ub80c\uce20-63 \ubc0f \ub85c\uc2ac\ub7ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \ud558\uc774\ud37c \ud63c\ub3c8 \uccb4\ub80c-\uc6b0\uc5d0\ud0c0 \uc5b4\ud2b8\ub799\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c, HypER\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc720\ud6a8 \uc608\uce21 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 ESN \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, 30\ud68c\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801 \uc2dc\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0b0\ud0c0\ud398 \ubc0f MIT-BIH \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uc2ec\ubc15\uc218 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uad6d\uc81c \ud0dc\uc591 \ud751\uc810 \uc218\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uadf8 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c HypER\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc1c\uc0b0 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc758 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub9ac\uc548\ud478\ub178\ud504 \uc131\uc7a5\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ubaa8\uc2b5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Consequently,\nevaluating prediction quality is more meaningful when considered in the context\nof its downstream use. Metrics based solely on predictive performance often\ndiverge from measures of real-world downstream impact. Existing approaches\nincorporate the downstream view by relying on multiple task-specific metrics,\nwhich can be burdensome to analyze, or by formulating cost-sensitive\nevaluations that require an explicit cost structure, typically assumed to be\nknown a priori. We frame this mismatch as an evaluation alignment problem and\npropose a data-driven method to learn a proxy evaluation function aligned with\nthe downstream evaluation. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, we\nexplore transformations of scoring rules that ensure the preservation of\npropriety. Our approach leverages weighted scoring rules parametrized by a\nneural network, where weighting is learned to align with the performance in the\ndownstream task. This enables fast and scalable evaluation cycles across tasks\nwhere the weighting is complex or unknown a priori.
