However, existing methods often rely on manually crafted triggers and static data pipelines, which are rigid, labor-intensive, and inadequate for systematically evaluating modern defense robustness. As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \\textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \\textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \\textit{Bias Recommendation}, \\textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \\textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work.

This behavior significantly increases security risks, also due to the fact that traditional password strength evaluation methods are often inadequate. In this discussion paper, we present SODA ADVANCE, a data reconstruction tool also designed to enhance evaluation processes related to the password strength. In particular, SODA ADVANCE integrates a specialized module aimed at evaluating password strength by leveraging publicly available data from multiple sources, including social media platforms.

Traditional approaches include writing custom GPU kernels and using specialized model compilers to tune high-level code for specific GPU targets. Recent work shows that LLM-based multi-agent systems can effectively perform such tuning, often outperforming existing compilers and eliminating the need for manual kernel development. However, the dynamics of multi-agent systems for this task remain unexplored. In this work, we present a logical framework for comparing multi-agent PyTorch optimization systems. Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps.

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era. Our study is to systematically challenge the foundational assumption that structure is inherently beneficial for LLM-based graph reasoning, opening the door to new, semantics-driven approaches for

This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ud611\ub825 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ucc28\uc774 \uac10\uc18c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ucc28\ubcc4 \ubcf4\uc0c1(HDR) \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ud611\ub825 \uc8fc\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "HDR \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc804\uc5ed \ud3ec\ud150\uc15c \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc28\uc774 \ubcf4\uc0c1(TRD)\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubcf4\uc0c1(ARG) \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "HDR \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \uc815\ucc45 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud611\ub825 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HDR\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ud78c \ud611\ub825 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ud611\ub825 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ucc28\uc758 \uac10\uc18c \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub0ae\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638 \ub300 \uc7a1\uc74c \ube44\uc728(SNR)\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \ubc0f \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \ubc29\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ucc28\ubcc4 \ubcf4\uc0c1(HDR) \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc778 \uc900 \uc548\uc815\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uadfc\uc811\uc131\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc2e4\ud328\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c HDR \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ubcf4\uc801 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc28\uc774 \ubcf4\uc0c1(TRD), \uc774\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654 \ucd94\uc138\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70; (2) \ud589\ub3d9 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubcf4\uc0c1(ARG), \uc774\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4 \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub192\uc740 SNR\uc758 \ub85c\uceec \uac00\uc774\ub4dc \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud611\ub825 \uc8fc\ud589 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubd80\ubd84 \uac00\uc2dc \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac8c\uc784(POMDPG)\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c HDR\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uad6c\ud604 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d(MCTS) \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 HDR \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \uc815\ucc45 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 HDR\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\ud1b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\uc740 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud611\ub825 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0, \ud611\ub825 \ubc0f \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, AAMAS \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc758 \uac1c\ub150 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc728\uc131, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(AAMAS) \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c BDI \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c, \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc81c\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac1c\ub150 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc815\ub82c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \ub2a5\ub825 \uc788\uace0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac08 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ud615\uc2dd \uc774\ub860\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc790\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ub2e4\ub9ac \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\uc2dc \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc728\uc131, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\uc804\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0, \ud611\ub825 \ubc0f \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 BDI \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c, \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc81c\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(AAMAS) \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \uac1c\ub150 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc815\ub82c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc788\uace0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ud615\uc2dd \uc774\ub860\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc790\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ub2e4\ub9ac \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\uc2dc \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and

While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \ud559\uc2b5(MIL)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 MIL\uc758 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud558\uba70 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MIL \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uac00 \ud558\ub098\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc591\uc131\uc774\uba74 \uac00\ubc29\ub3c4 \uc591\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1\ub418\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc870\uac74\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 MIL \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uc774 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc774 \ubd80\ud480\ub824\uc9c0\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubca1\ud130 \uae30\ud638 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(VSA)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 MIL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc640 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uac70\uc758 \uc9c1\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubca1\ud130\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\ub958 \uc911 iff \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\uc218\uc801 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud45c\uc900 MIL \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud568\uacfc \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 MIL \uacf5\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \ub530\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 MIL \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \ud559\uc2b5(MIL) \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uac00\ubc29\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uac00 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc77c \ub54c\ub9cc \uac00\ubc29\uc774 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \ubd99\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 MIL \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \uc9c0\ud45c\uac00 \ubd80\ud480\ub824\uc9c0\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc774 \ubc1d\ud600\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ud638 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubca1\ud130 \uae30\ud638 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(VSA)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 MIL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc640 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uac70\uc758 \uc9c1\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubca1\ud130\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\ub958 \uc911 iff \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\uc218\uc801 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c MIL \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 VSA \ud45c\ud604 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc785\ub825 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c VSA \ud638\ud658 \ubca1\ud130\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc694 \ubd84\ud3ec \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

For these agents, scaling involves not only \"thinking\" in tokens but also \"acting\" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack \"budget awareness\" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to \"dig deeper\" on a promising lead or \"pivot\" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c

This fundamental mismatch between model assumptions and neural geometry limits representation quality and cross-subject generalization. ManifoldFormer addresses this limitation through a novel geometric deep learning framework that explicitly learns neural manifold representations. The architecture integrates three key innovations: a Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding that preserves geometric structure, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention mechanisms operating directly on neural manifolds, and a dynamics predictor leveraging neural ODEs for manifold-constrained temporal evolution. Extensive evaluation across four public datasets demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 4.6-4.8% higher accuracy and 6.2-10.2% higher Cohen's Kappa, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization. The geometric approach reveals meaningful neural patterns consistent with neurophysiological principles, establishing geometric constraints as essential for effective EEG foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "ManifoldFormer\ub294 EEG \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ub1cc \ud65c\ub3d9\uc758 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\ub85c \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "EEG \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Riemannian VAE, \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 Transformer \ubc0f \uc2e0\uacbd ODE\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec EEG \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 4.6-4.8% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 6.2-10.2% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c Cohen's Kappa\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc0dd\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uc6d0\uce59\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uba70, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 EEG \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc784\uc744 Establish\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 EEG \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uc5ec, \ub1cc \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ud558 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc815\uacfc \uc2e0\uacbd \uae30\ud558\ud559 \uac04\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \ud53c\ud5d8\uc790 \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards.

Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency. Moreover, PersonalizedRouter demonstrates strong few-shot generalization, achieving 64.81% and 85.80% of the fully trained model's performance when adapting to new users and new LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr":

Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr":

Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\\%, and up to 9\\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud2b9\ud5c8 \uccad\uad6c \ud56d\ubaa9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc131\uacfc \ubc95\uc801 \ubc94\uc704 \uc720\uc9c0 \uac04\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ud310\uc801 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\uc640 \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c Tree of Claims (ToC) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud2b9\ud5c8 \uccad\uad6c \ud56d\ubaa9 \uc791\uc131\uc740 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uba70 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uccad\uad6c \ud56d\ubaa9 \uc218\uc815\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uacb0\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ToC\ub294 \uccad\uad6c \ud56d\ubaa9 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\uba70, LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 EditorAgent\uc640 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud2b9\ud5c8 \uc2ec\uc0ac\uc6d0\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\ub294 ExaminerAgent\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 ToC\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc131, \ubc94\uc704 \uc720\uc9c0, \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "1145\uac1c\uc758 \uccad\uad6c \ud56d\ubaa9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, ToC\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubc0f \uc801\uc740 \uc0f7 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 LLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3c9\uade0 8%\uc758 \uc810\uc218 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 9%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ToC\ub294 \uc120\uc9c4 LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 MCTS \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub294 https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud2b9\ud5c8 \uccad\uad6c \ud56d\ubaa9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc131\uacfc \ubc95\uc801 \ubc94\uc704\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c, \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uccad\uad6c \uc791\uc131\uc740 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uccad\uad6c \ud56d\ubaa9 \uc218\uc815\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uacb0\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c Tree of Claims (ToC) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user. We study LLM whistleblowing: a subset of this behavior where models disclose suspected misconduct to parties beyond the dialog boundary (e.g., regulatory agencies) without user instruction or knowledge. We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates. Additionally, we verify the robustness of our dataset by testing for model evaluation awareness, and find that both black-box methods and probes on model activations show lower evaluation awareness in our settings than in comparable previous work.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ub82c \uad50\uc721 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uba85\ub839 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc678\ubd80\uc5d0 \uc758\uc2ec\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uace0\ubc1c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uc791\ub41c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubc30\uce58\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc815\ub82c \uad50\uc721\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uace0\ubc1c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubaa8\uc74c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uace0\ubc1c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4 \uac04 \uace0\ubc1c\uc758 \ube48\ub3c4\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e4\ub974\uace0, \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\uc544\uc9c0\uba74 \uace0\ubc1c \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba70, \ub3c4\ub355\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uace0\ubc1c \ube44\uc728\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ube44\uad50 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uc815\ub82c \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\ub098 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uacfc \ubaa8\uc21c\ub418\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uace0\ubc1c\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc758\uc2ec\ub418\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\ud589\uc704\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c0\uce68\uc774\ub098 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c6\uc774 \ub300\ud654 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \uc678\ubd80 \ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uace0\ubc1c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubaa8\uc74c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 (1) \uace0\ubc1c \ube48\ub3c4\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0, (2) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74 \uace0\ubc1c \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \ub0ae\uc544\uc9c0\uace0, (3) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c4\ub355\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uba74 \uace0\ubc1c \ube44\uc728\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba70, (4) \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \uba85\ubc31\ud55c \ube44\uace0\ubc1c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc138\ubd80 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74 \uace0\ubc1c \ube44\uc728\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\ube0c \ubaa8\ub450 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574

This study addresses monthly automobile demand forecasting across a multi-product, multi-market, and multi-level hierarchy using data from a German premium manufacturer. The methodology combines point and probabilistic forecasts across strategic and operational planning levels, leveraging ensembles of LightGBM models with pooled training sets, quantile regression, and a mixed-integer linear programming reconciliation approach. Results highlight that spatiotemporal dependencies, as well as rounding bias, significantly affect forecast accuracy, underscoring the importance of integer forecasts for operational feasibility.

However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc778\uc2dd(CP)\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c SRA-CP \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 CP \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc548\uc804\uacfc \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc804\uc1a1\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 CP \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SRA-CP\ub294 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uc778\uc2dd \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc694\uc57d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube0c\ub85c\ub4dc\uce90\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uace0, \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub828 \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \uc874\uc774 \uac10\uc9c0\ub420 \ub54c\ub9cc \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 CV\ub294 \uad6d\uc18c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc28\ud3d0\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c\uc9c0\ub97c \ud310\ub2e8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SRA-CP\ub294 \uacf5\uacf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc548\uc804\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac1d\uccb4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 1% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4(AP) \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc758 20%\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 CP \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 15%\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SRA-CP\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \ube44\ud310\uc801 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uba70 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uad50\ud658\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 CP\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc778\uc2dd(CP)\uc740 \uc5f0\uacb0 \ucc28\ub7c9(CV) \uac04 \uc815\ubcf4 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc77c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uac10\uc9c0\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18 CP \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc548\uc804\uacfc \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc804\uc1a1\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 CP \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc801\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\ubc1c\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ud611\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd(SRA-CP) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this paper, we propose a Feudal Q-learning scheme and investigate under which conditions its coupled updates converge and are stable. By leveraging the theory of Stochastic Approximation and the ODE method, we present a theorem stating the convergence and stability properties of Feudal Q-learning. This provides a principled convergence and stability analysis tailored to Feudal RL. Moreover, we show that the updates converge to a point that can be interpreted as an equilibrium of a suitably defined game, opening the door to game-theoretic approaches to Hierarchical RL. Lastly, experiments based on the Feudal Q-learning algorithm support the outcomes anticipated by theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc704\uacc4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub4a4\ucc98\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadc0\uc871 Q-\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc5f0\uad00\ub41c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc218\ub834\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud655\ub960 \uadfc\uc0ac \uc774\ub860\uacfc ODE \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uadc0\uc871 Q-\ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc9c4\uc220\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uadc0\uc871 RL\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucda4\ud654\ub41c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub834 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc801\uc808\ud558\uac8c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 RL\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uadc0\uc871 Q-\ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uc0c1\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc704\uacc4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uae30.", "method": "\uadc0\uc871 Q-\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ud655\ub960 \uadfc\uc0ac \uc774\ub860\uacfc ODE \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc815\ub9ac\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c.", "result": "\uadc0\uc871 Q-\ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uadc0\uc871 Q-\ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uacc4\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uaca0\ub2e4\uace0 \uc57d\uc18d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub4a4\ucc98\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Feudal Q-learning \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uacb0\ud569 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc218\ub834\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud655\ub960 \uadfc\uc0ac \uc774\ub860\uacfc ODE \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Feudal Q-learning\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc9c4\uc220\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 Feudal RL\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucda4\ud654\ub41c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub834 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc801\uc808\ud558\uac8c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 RL\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, Feudal Q-learning \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc774 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uc0c1\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg. Our results indicate that explicitly shaping local geometry is a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "CurvSSL\uc740 \uace1\ub960 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ube44\ub300\uc870\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CurvSSL\uc740 \uace1\ub960 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \ubdf0 \uc778\ucf54\ub354-\ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud130 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ucf54\uc0ac\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uace1\ub960 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MNIST\uc640 CIFAR-10 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, CurvSSL\uc740 Barlow Twins\uc640 VICReg\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\uac70\ub098 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc120\ud615 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc9c0\uc5ed \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc21c\uc218\ud558\uac8c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uae30\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc644\ucc45\uc784\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5(SSL)\uc740 \ubd88\ubcc0\ud56d\uc744 \ubd84\uc0b0, \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0 \ub610\ub294 \uc911\ubcf5 \uac10\uc18c \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ub300\uc870\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 1\ucc28 \ubc0f 2\ucc28 \ud1b5\uacc4\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace1\ub960 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CurvSSL\uacfc \uadf8 RKHS \ud655\uc7a5\uc778 \ucee4\ub110 CurvSSL\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 Barlow Twins \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5 \uac10\uc18c \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud45c\uc900 \ub450 \ubdf0 \uc778\ucf54\ub354-\ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud130 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c, \uace1\ub960 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uac15\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc740 \uc815\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub418\uba70, \uadf8 $k$ \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc774\uc6c3\uc740 \ub2e8\uc704 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uad6c\uc758 \ucf54\uc0ac\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc0b0 \uace1\ub960 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucee4\ub110 \ubcc0\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace1\ub960\uc774 RKHS\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ub85c\uceec \uadf8\ub7a8 \ud589\ub82c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc810\uc218\ub294 \uace1\ub960 \uc720\ub3c4 \ud589\ub82c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c Barlow \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4\ub85c \uc99d\uac15 \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ub82c \ubc0f \ube44\uc0c1\uad00\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud1b5\uc77c\ub41c \ubdf0 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc \uad7d\ud798\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration.

Submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine", "summary": "Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions. By eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing, our method unlocks the potential for portable, deployable MALDI-MS platforms, revolutionizing environmental pathogen detection and rapid response to biological threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "MALDI-MS\ub294 \ubcd1\uc6d0\uccb4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\uc220\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \uc900\ube44 \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc88 \uce21\uc815\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud658\uacbd \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0\ub294 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c MS-DGFormer\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc900\ube44\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc9c8\ub7c9 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc77c \uce21\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud658\uacbd \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcd1\uc6d0\uccb4\ub97c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MALDI-MS\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud658\uacbd \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83.", "method": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc9c8\ub7c9 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \uc7a5\uae30 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e8\uc77c \uce21\uc815 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0dd\uccb4 \ubd84\uc790 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uc5ec, \uc5d0\uc5b4\ub85c\uc878 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcd1\uc6d0\uccb4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud658\uacbd \ubcd1\uc6d0\uccb4 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ub300\uc751\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\ud558\ub294 \ud734\ub300\uc6a9 MALDI-MS \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc870 \ub808\uc774\uc800 \ud0c8\ucc29/\uc774\uc628\ud654 \uc9c8\ub7c9 \ubd84\uc11d (MALDI-MS)\uc740 \ubcd1\uc6d0\uccb4\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc9c8\ub7c9 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc11c\uba85\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uccb4 \ubd84\uc790 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\uc220\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc900\ube44\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc0f7 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud658\uacbd \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc5d0\uc5b4\ub85c\uc878 \ubd84\uc11d\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc774 \uc2dc\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc5b4\ub85c\uc878 MALDI-MS \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c8\ub7c9 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc0ac\uc804 \uc548\ub0b4 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 (MS-DGFormer)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc900\ube44\ub85c \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc9c8\ub7c9 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information.

To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\ubaa8\uac00 \ud070 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, '\uc720\uc0ac\ud55c' \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac01\uae30 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub85c\uceec \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub85c \ub098\ub204\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uac01 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd9c\ub825\ud558\uba70, \ub192\uc740 \ud655\ub960\ub85c \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \uad6c\ud604 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacbd\ubbf8\ud55c \ub85c\uadf8 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub9cc \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\ubaa8\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.
