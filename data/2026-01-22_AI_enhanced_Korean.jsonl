To address this, we present the Compositional Symbolic Music Reasoning Benchmark (CSyMR-Bench), a curated multiple-choice dataset of 126 questions derived from expert forums and professional examinations. Each item involves combining several atomic analyses to arrive at the final answer. Furthermore, we introduce a tool-augmented agent framework that leverages symbolic music analysis tools from the music21 library to address the challenges posed by CSyMR-Bench.

CAPQL, a preference-conditioned actor-critic method, achieves this by conditioning on weight vectors w and restricts data usage to the specific preferences under which it was collected, leaving off-policy data from other preferences unused. We introduce Hindsight Preference Replay (HPR), a simple and general replay augmentation strategy that retroactively relabels stored transitions with alternative preferences. This densifies supervision across the preference simplex without altering the CAPQL architecture or loss functions. Evaluated on six MO-Gymnasium locomotion tasks at a fixed 300000-step budget using expected utility (EUM), hypervolume (HV), and sparsity, HPR-CAPQL improves HV in five of six environments and EUM in four of six. On mo-humanoid-v5, for instance, EUM rises from $323\\!\\pm\\!125$ to $1613\\!\\pm\\!464$ and HV from 0.52M to 9.63M, with strong statistical support. mo-halfcheetah-v5 remains a challenging exception where CAPQL attains higher HV at comparable EUM.

It comprises multiple modalities, including structured data, clinical notes, waveforms, and imaging data. Working with these disjointed modalities requires an extensive manual effort to preprocess and align them for downstream analysis. While several pipelines for MIMIC-IV data extraction are available, they target a small subset of modalities or do not fully support arbitrary downstream applications. In this work, we greatly expand our prior popular unimodal pipeline and present a comprehensive and customizable multimodal pipeline that can significantly reduce multimodal processing time and enhance the reproducibility of MIMIC-based studies. Our pipeline systematically integrates the listed modalities, enabling automated cohort selection, temporal alignment across modalities, and standardized multimodal output formats suitable for arbitrary static and time-series downstream applications. We release the code, a simple UI, and a Python package for selective integration (with embedding) at https://github.com/healthylaife/MIMIC-IV-Data-Pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "MIMIC-IV \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c0\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MIMIC-IV \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\uc640 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc120\ud0dd, \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uac04\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc815\ub82c, \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ucd9c\ub825 \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ucc98\ub9ac \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e8\ucd95\ud558\uace0 MIMIC \uae30\ubc18 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucf54\ub4dc\uc640 UI, Python \ud328\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "MIMIC-IV \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacf5\uac1c \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d (EHR) \uc790\uc6d0\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130, \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8, \ud30c\ud615, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e8\uc808\ub41c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud558\ub958 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\uc640 \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Using ubiquitous sensors such as Passive InfraRed sensors (PIR) and door sensors is drawing increasing interest for monitoring daily activities and facilitating preventative healthcare interventions for the elderly. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from passive sensors mostly relies on traditional machine learning and includes data segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. While techniques like Sensor Weighting Mutual Information (SWMI) capture spatial context in a feature vector, effectively leveraging temporal information remains a challenge. We tackle this by clustering activities into morning, afternoon, and night, and encoding them into the feature weighting method calculating distinct mutual information matrices. We further propose to extend the feature vector by incorporating time of day and day of week as cyclical temporal features, as well as adding a feature to track the user's location. The experiments show improved accuracy and F1-score over existing state-of-the-art methods in three out of four real-world datasets, with highest gains in a low-data regime. These results highlight the potential of our approach for developing effective smart home solutions to support ageing in place.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub178\uc778\ub4e4\uc774 \uc790\ud0dd\uc5d0\uc11c

This paper aims to understand and mitigate such attacks through the lens of privilege escalation, defined as agent actions exceeding the least privilege required for a user's intended task. Based on a formal model of LLM agent systems, we identify novel privilege escalation scenarios, particularly in multi-agent systems, including a variant akin to the classic confused deputy problem. To defend against both known and newly demonstrated privilege escalation, we propose SEAgent, a mandatory access control (MAC) framework built upon attribute-based access control (ABAC). SEAgent monitors agent-tool interactions via an information flow graph and enforces customizable security policies based on entity attributes. Our evaluations show that SEAgent effectively blocks various privilege escalation while maintaining a low false positive rate and negligible system overhead.

However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \\textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research. We also note that single-LLM methods cannot capture heterogeneous workflows due to the lack of KV cache sharing across different LLMs, highlighting future opportunities in developing \\textit{truly}

Brian Park"], "title": "Multi-agent DRL-based Lane Change Decision Model for Cooperative Planning in Mixed Traffic", "comment": "Under review at IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems", "summary": "Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) possess the ability to communicate and coordinate with one another, enabling cooperative platooning that enhances both energy efficiency and traffic flow. However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently manages fluctuating traffic agent numbers, significantly outperforming the baseline rule-based models. Notably, it enhances cooperative platooning rates up to 26.2\\%, showcasing its potential to optimize CAV cooperation and traffic dynamics during the early stage of deployment.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, stemming from the batch-independence assumption during testing, which prevents the model from leveraging valuable knowledge accumulated from previous batches. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time method called Incremental Prototype Enhancement Classifier (IPEC), a test-time method that optimizes prototype estimation by leveraging information from previous query samples. IPEC maintains a dynamic auxiliary set by selectively incorporating query samples that are classified with high confidence. To ensure sample quality, we design a robust dual-filtering mechanism that assesses each query sample based on both global prediction confidence and local discriminative ability. By aggregating this auxiliary set with the support set in subsequent tasks, IPEC builds progressively more stable and representative prototypes, effectively reducing its reliance on the initial support set. We ground this approach in a Bayesian interpretation, conceptualizing the support set as a prior and the auxiliary set as a data-driven posterior, which in turn motivates the design of a practical \"warm-up and test\" two-stage inference protocol. Extensive empirical results validate the superior performance of our proposed method across multiple few-shot classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 Incremental Prototype Enhancement Classifier (IPEC)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc810 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uae30\ubc18\uc758 few-shot \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uad6c\ud604\uc774 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubc30\uce58 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131 \uac00\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc774\uc804 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd95\uc801\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4.", "method": "IPEC\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ub41c \ucffc\ub9ac \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9cc\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc608\uce21 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ub85c\uceec \ubcc0\ubcc4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "IPEC\ub294 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc9d1\ud569\uacfc \uc774 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec few-shot \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uae30\ubc18\uc758 few-shot \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uad6c\ud604\uc774 \ube44\uad50\uc801 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc73c\uba70 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc778\uae30\ub97c \ub04c\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\uce58 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131 \uac00\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc774\uc804 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd95\uc801\ub41c \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 Incremental Prototype Enhancement Classifier (IPEC)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc810 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, their design operates under the implicit assumption of Visual Atomicity: that the UI state remains invariant between observation and action. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface.\n  We present Action Rebinding, a novel attack that allows a seemingly-benign app with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.\n  We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal). Our findings reveal a fundamental architectural flaw in current agent-OS integration and provide critical insights for the secure design of future agent systems.

We propose a novel multi-agent framework that addresses both limitations through specialized agent roles and integrated watermarking mechanisms. Unlike existing multi-agent systems focused solely on generation quality, our approach uniquely combines controllable content synthesis with provenance protection during the generation process itself. The framework orchestrates Director/Planner, Generator, Reviewer, Integration, and Protection agents with human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure alignment with user intent while embedding imperceptible digital watermarks. We formalize the pipeline as a joint optimization objective unifying controllability, semantic alignment, and protection robustness.

We present POLARIS (Policy-Aware LLM Agentic Reasoning for Integrated Systems), a governed orchestration framework that treats automation as typed plan synthesis and validated execution over LLM agents. A planner proposes structurally diverse, type checked directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), a rubric guided reasoning module selects a single compliant plan, and execution is guarded by validator gated checks, a bounded repair loop, and compiled policy guardrails that block or route side effects before they occur. Applied to document centric finance tasks, POLARIS produces decision grade artifacts and full execution traces while reducing human intervention. Empirically, POLARIS achieves a micro F1 of 0.81 on the SROIE dataset and, on a controlled synthetic suite, achieves 0.95 to 1.00 precision for anomaly routing with preserved audit trails. These evaluations constitute an initial benchmark for governed Agentic AI. POLARIS provides a methodological and benchmark reference for policy-aligned Agentic AI.

Although they exhibit strong average zero-shot performance on forecasting tasks, their predictions on certain critical regions of the data are not always reliable, limiting their usability in real-world applications, especially when data exhibits unique trends. In this paper, we propose a selective forecasting framework to identify these critical segments of time series using shapelets. We learn shapelets using shift-invariant dictionary learning on the validation split of the target domain dataset. Utilizing distance-based similarity to these shapelets, we facilitate the user to selectively discard unreliable predictions and be informed of the model's realistic capabilities. Empirical results on diverse benchmark time series datasets demonstrate that our approach leveraging both zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models reduces the overall error by an average of 22.17% for zero-shot and 22.62% for full-shot fine-tuned model.

This paper introduces CryptoFair-FL, a novel cryptographic framework providing the first verifiable fairness guarantees for federated learning systems under formal security definitions. The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \\log n) while maintaining (\\dparam, \\deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging.

SF allows agents to operate over scoped views of shared memory, propose structured updates, and maintain global coherence through local ontology-based validation and refresh without centralized control or explicit message passing. The central theoretical result is a bisimulation theorem showing that each agent's local execution is behaviorally equivalent to its projection of the global semantics, in both deterministic and probabilistic settings. This enables safety, liveness, and temporal properties to be verified locally and soundly lifted to the full system. SF supports agents whose update proposals vary across invocations, including those generated by learned or heuristic components, provided updates pass semantic validation before integration. We establish deterministic and probabilistic guarantees ensuring semantic alignment under asynchronous or degraded communication. To validate the model operationally, we implement a lightweight reference architecture that instantiates its core mechanisms. A 250-agent simulation evaluates these properties across over 11,000 validated updates, demonstrating convergence under probabilistic refresh, bounded communication, and resilience to agent failure.

Includes a new benchmark dataset (code-logic-bench) and evaluation of neurosymbolic reasoning for software analysis", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on code understanding tasks, yet they fundamentally lack the ability to perform precise, exhaustive mathematical reasoning about program behavior. Existing benchmarks either focus on mathematical proof automation, largely disconnected from real-world software, or on engineering tasks that do not require semantic rigor.\n  We present CodeLogician, a neurosymbolic agent for precise analysis of software logic, integrated with ImandraX, an industrial automated reasoning engine deployed in financial markets and safety-critical systems. Unlike prior approaches that use formal methods primarily to validate LLM outputs, CodeLogician uses LLMs to construct explicit formal models of software systems, enabling automated reasoning to answer rich semantic questions beyond binary verification outcomes.\n  To rigorously evaluate mathematical reasoning about software logic, we introduce code-logic-bench, a benchmark targeting the middle ground between theorem proving and software engineering benchmarks. It measures reasoning correctness about program state spaces, control flow, coverage constraints, and edge cases, with ground truth defined via formal modeling and region decomposition.\n  Comparing LLM-only reasoning against LLMs augmented with CodeLogician, formal augmentation yields substantial improvements, closing a 41-47 percentage point gap in reasoning accuracy. These results demonstrate that neurosymbolic integration is essential for scaling program analysis toward rigorous, autonomous software understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "CodeLogician\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uae30\ud638\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc774\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CodeLogician\uc740 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uacf5\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, ImandraX\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CodeLogician\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c LLM\uacfc LLM\ub9cc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uac15\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c 41-47%\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uae30\ud638\uc801 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ubd84\uc11d \uaddc\ubaa8\ub97c \ud655\ub300\ud558\uc5ec \uc5c4\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc774\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc640\ub294 \ud070 \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc99d\uba85 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uac70\ub098, \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud568\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc758 \uc815\ubc00 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \uae30\ud638\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 CodeLogician\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uae08\uc735 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804-critical \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc778 ImandraX\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uc8fc\ub85c LLM \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, CodeLogician\uc740 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uacf5\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc9c4 \uac80\uc99d \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub118\ub294 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85\uacfc \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 code-logic-bench\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04, \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984, \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc57d, \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc900 \uc9c4\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc601\uc5ed \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\uc758\ub41c\ub2e4.

More precisely, different state-action pairs exhibit different degree of importance or difficulty which must be actively and explicitly built into a controlled exploration strategy. To this end, we propose a weighted and parameterized family of concave coverage objectives, denoted by $U_\u03c1$, defined directly over state--action occupancy measures. This family unifies several widely studied objectives within a single framework, including divergence-based marginal matching, weighted average coverage, and worst-case (minimax) coverage. While the concavity of $U_\u03c1$ captures the diminishing return associated with over-exploration, the simple closed form of the gradient of $U_\u03c1$ enables an explicit control to prioritize under-explored state--action pairs. Leveraging this structure, we develop a gradient-based algorithm that actively steers the induced occupancy toward a desired coverage pattern. Moreover, we show that as $\u03c1$ increases, the resulting exploration strategy increasingly emphasizes the least-explored state--action pairs, recovering worst-case coverage behavior in the limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0ac\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc810\uc720 \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc624\ubaa9 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uac00\uc911\ud654 \ubc0f \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \uac00\uc871\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\ub294 MDP\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac00\uc911\ud654\ub41c \uc624\ubaa9 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uacbd\ub7c9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ub35c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\u03c1\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ucd5c\uc18c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc744 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4 \uc81c\ud55c \uc218\uce58\uc758 worst-case \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc758\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c(MDP)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ub9d0\ud558\uba74, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc740 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub610\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\uc601\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc810\uc720 \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uac00\uc911\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \uc624\ubaa9 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac00\uc871\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac00\uc871\uc740 \ubc1c\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc8fc\ubcc0 \ub9e4\uce6d, \uac00\uc911 \ud3c9\uade0 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0(\ubbf8\ub2c8\ub9e5\uc2a4) \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub110\ub9ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While such tools extend capability, improper tool permissions introduce security risks such as indirect prompt injection and tool misuse. We characterize these failures as unbalanced tool-driven agency. Agents may retain unnecessary permissions (excessive agency) or fail to invoke required tools (insufficient agency), amplifying the attack surface and reducing performance. We introduce AgenTRIM, a framework for detecting and mitigating tool-driven agency risks without altering an agent's internal reasoning. AgenTRIM addresses these risks through complementary offline and online phases. Offline, AgenTRIM reconstructs and verifies the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces. At runtime, it enforces per-step least-privilege tool access through adaptive filtering and status-aware validation of tool calls. Evaluating on the AgentDojo benchmark, AgenTRIM substantially reduces attack success while maintaining high task performance. Additional experiments show robustness to description-based attacks and effective enforcement of explicit safety policies. Together, these results demonstrate that AgenTRIM provides a practical, capability-preserving approach to safer tool use in LLM-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgenTRIM\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uad8c\ud55c \ub610\ub294 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uad8c\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc2dc \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uad8c\ud55c \ubc0f \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uad8c\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "AgenTRIM\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\uc2dd \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc18c \uad8c\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc2dc\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AgentDojo \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AgenTRIM\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uacfc \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc99d\ub300\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \uad8c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uac04\uc811 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \ub0a8\uc6a9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ub9ac\ub85c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9d3\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uad8c\ud55c(\uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac)\uc744 \ubcf4\uc720\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac70\ub098 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(\ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac), \uc774\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 AgenTRIM\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ub9ac \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220 \uac1c\uc694\uc640 \uadf8 \uac15\uc810 \ubc0f \uc57d\uc810 \ubd84\uc11d.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "29\uac1c\uc758 \uad00\ub828 \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \uc2ec\uce35 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uae30\ubc95\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00.", "result": "\uba85\uc2dc\uc801, \uc554\uc2dc\uc801, \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uacc4\uce35\uc801/\uc5ed\ud560 \uae30\ubc18 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \ube44\uad50 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacf5\ubc31\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc758 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc131\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud658\uacbd, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131 \ubc0f \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc218\ub9ce\uc740 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc740 \ub610\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\uc694\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc8fc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c 29\uac1c\uc758 \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \uc2ec\uce35 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uba85\uc2dc\uc801, \uc554\uc2dc\uc801, \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uacc4\uce35\uc801/\uc5ed\ud560 \uae30\ubc18 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ube44\uad50\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ud788\ub824 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uad50\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacf5\ubc31\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc758 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing evaluation approaches often limit themselves to single-response scoring or narrow benchmarks, which lack stability, extensibility, and automation when deployed in enterprise settings at multi-agent scale. We present AEMA (Adaptive Evaluation Multi-Agent), a process-aware and auditable framework that plans, executes, and aggregates multi-step evaluations across heterogeneous agentic workflows under human oversight. Compared to a single LLM-as-a-Judge, AEMA achieves greater stability, human alignment, and traceable records that support accountable automation. Our results on enterprise-style agent workflows simulated using realistic business scenarios demonstrate that AEMA provides a transparent and reproducible pathway toward responsible evaluation of LLM-based multi-agent systems.\n  Keywords Agentic AI, Multi-Agent Systems, Trustworthy AI, Verifiable Evaluation, Human Oversight", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c AEMA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc870\uc815, \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "AEMA(Adaptive Evaluation Multi-Agent)\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d, \uc2e4\ud589 \ubc0f \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AEMA\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c LLM-\ud310\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uc815\ub82c\uc131, \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uc801 \uac00\ub2a5 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AEMA\uac00 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc870\uc815, \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubc0f \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc57c \ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc751\ub2f5 \uc810\uc218 \ub9e4\uae30\uae30 \ub610\ub294 \uc881\uc740 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uae30\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ud560 \ub54c \uc548\uc815\uc131, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 AEMA(Adaptive Evaluation Multi-Agent)\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\ud558\uc5d0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d, \uc2e4\ud589 \ubc0f \uc9d1\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c LLM-\ud310\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 AEMA\ub294 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc131, \uc778\uac04 \uc815\ub82c \ubc0f \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uc801 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc5c5 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AEMA\uac00 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $\u0393$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $\u03c6$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $\u0393$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $\u0393$ to $N\u0393$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(\u0393)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $\u03a9(\u0393)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $\u0393=\u0398(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $\u03bd$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $\u0393$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubcc0\uc870\uc640 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uac80\uc99d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca1\ud130 \uac12 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4

However, it remains highly vulnerable to cyberattacks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. Developing effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) for IoFT networks faces key challenges, including data imbalance, privacy concerns, and the limited capability of traditional models to detect rare but potentially damaging cyber threats. In this work, we propose PrivFly, a privacy-preserving IDS framework that integrates self-supervised representation learning and differential privacy (DP) to enhance detection performance in imbalanced IoFT network traffic. We propose a masked feature reconstruction module for self-supervised pretraining, improving feature representations and boosting rare-class detection. Differential privacy is applied during training to protect sensitive information without significantly compromising model performance. In addition, we conduct a SHapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based analysis to evaluate the impact of DP on feature importance and model behavior. Experimental results on the ECU-IoFT dataset show that PrivFly achieves up to 98% accuracy and 99% F1-score, effectively balancing privacy and detection performance for secure IoFT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "PrivFly\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ucc28\ub4f1 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec IoFT \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "IoFT\ub294 \uae30\ubc00\uc131, \ubb34\uacb0\uc131, \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud611\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "PrivFly\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ucc28\ub4f1 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud55c IoFT \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "PrivFly\ub294 ECU-IoFT \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 98%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 99%\uc758 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, IoFT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc640 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PrivFly\ub294 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc640 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c IoFT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\ud589 \uc0ac\ubb3c \uc778\ud130\ub137(IoFT)\uc740 \uacf5\uc911 \uac10\uc2dc \ubc0f \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uae30\ubc00\uc131, \ubb34\uacb0\uc131 \ubc0f \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud611\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.

As MAS become increasingly deployed in web services (e.g., search engines), designing adaptive topologies for diverse cross-domain user queries becomes essential. Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a \"one-for-one\" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs. Experiments across six diverse benchmarks show that OFA-TAD significantly outperforms specialized one-for-one models, generating highly adaptive MAS topologies.

Existing self-improving frameworks attempt to bridge this gap but typically rely on inefficient, multi-turn recursive loops that incur high computational costs. To address this, we propose Metacognitive Agent Reflective Self-improvement (MARS), a framework that achieves efficient self-evolution within a single recurrence cycle. Inspired by educational psychology, MARS mimics human learning by integrating principle-based reflection (abstracting normative rules to avoid errors) and procedural reflection (deriving step-by-step strategies for success). By synthesizing these insights into optimized instructions, MARS allows agents to systematically refine their reasoning logic without continuous online feedback.

Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses this by maximizing returns under predefined constraints, typically formulated as the expected cumulative cost. However, expectation-based constraints overlook rare but high-impact extreme value events in the tail distribution, such as black swan incidents, which can lead to severe constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose the Extreme Value policy Optimization (EVO) algorithm, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model and exploit extreme reward and cost samples, reducing constraint violations. EVO introduces an extreme quantile optimization objective to explicitly capture extreme samples in the cost tail distribution. Additionally, we propose an extreme prioritization mechanism during replay, amplifying the learning signal from rare but high-impact extreme samples. Theoretically, we establish upper bounds on expected constraint violations during policy updates, guaranteeing strict constraint satisfaction at a zero-violation quantile level. Further, we demonstrate that EVO achieves a lower probability of constraint violations than expectation-based methods and exhibits lower variance than quantile regression methods. Extensive experiments show that EVO significantly reduces constraint violations during training while maintaining competitive policy performance compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "EVO \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 Extreme Value Theory\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub4dc\ubb38 \uace0\ucda9\uaca9 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\uc57d \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "EVO \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \ube44\uc6a9 \uaf2c\ub9ac \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "EVO\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \uc704\ubc18\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ub300 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc591\uc790 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub3c4 \ub0ae\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EVO\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uc81c\uc57d \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uae30\uc874 \uc815\ucc45 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc57d \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(CRL)\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1 \ub204\uc801 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc775\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\ub300 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc57d\uc740 \ube14\ub799 \uc2a4\uc644 \uc0ac\uac74\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub4dc\ubb3c\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uac00\uce58 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc704\ubc18\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uac00\uce58 \uc774\ub860(EVT)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uac00\uce58 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(EVO) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Liu et al. (USENIX Security'24) presented the first relatively practical approach by utilizing Shamir secret sharing with Mersenne prime fields. However, when processing deeper neural networks such as VGG16, their protocols incur substantial communication overhead, resulting in particularly significant latency in wide-area network (WAN) environments. In this paper, we propose a high-throughput and scalable MPC protocol for neural network inference against semi-honest adversaries in the honest-majority setting. The core of our approach lies in leveraging packed Shamir secret sharing (PSS) to enable parallel computation and reduce communication complexity. The main contributions are three-fold: i) We present a communication-efficient protocol for vector-matrix multiplication, based on our newly defined notion of vector-matrix multiplication-friendly random share tuples. ii) We design the filter packing approach that enables parallel convolution. iii) We further extend all non-linear protocols based on Shamir secret sharing to the PSS-based protocols for achieving parallel non-linear operations. Extensive experiments across various datasets and neural networks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in WAN. Compared to Liu et al. (USENIX Security'24), our scheme reduces the communication upto 5.85x, 11.17x, and 6.83x in offline, online and total communication overhead, respectively. In addition, our scheme is upto 1.59x, 2.61x, and 1.75x faster in offline, online and total running time, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubc18\u8bda\u5b9e \uc801\ub300\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c MPC \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 MPC \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\uac00 \ucd5c\ub300 4\uba85\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud3ec\uc7a5\ub41c \uc0e4\ubbf8\ub974 \ube44\ubc00 \uacf5\uc720(PSS)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcd1\ub82c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c WAN \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Liu et al.\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ub2e4\uc790\uac04 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud14c\uc774\uc158(MPC) \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ucd5c\ub300 4\uba85\uc758 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub9cc\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.

Using a multiagent systems approach, two types of agents (pedestrians and vehicles) are introduced within a 2D grid based urban environment. The environment encodes streets, sidewalks, buildings, zebra crossings, and obstacles such as potholes and infrastructure elements. Each agent employs a weighted A* algorithm for pathfinding, allowing for variation in decision making behavior such as reckless movement or strict rule-following. The model aims to simulate interactions, assess risk of collisions, and evaluate efficiency under varying environmental and behavioral conditions.

While large language models (LLMs) can generate free-form suggestions, their outputs often lack accuracy and depth of reasoning. In this paper, we present a multi-agent, LLM-based framework for prescriptive decision support, which transforms large scale review corpora into actionable business advice. The framework integrates four components: clustering to select representative reviews, generation of advices, iterative evaluation, and feasibility based ranking. This design couples corpus distillation with feedback driven advice refinement to produce outputs that are specific, actionable, and practical. Experiments across three service domains and multiple model families show that our framework consistently outperform single model baselines on actionability, specificity, and non-redundancy, with medium sized models approaching the performance of large model frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\uac1d \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc870\uc5b8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uac1d \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub294 \uc81c\ud488\uc758 \uc57d\uc810\uacfc \ucda9\uc871\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774\ub098 \uce21\uba74 \ucd94\ucd9c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub300\ud45c \ub9ac\ubdf0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad70\uc9d1\ud654, \uc870\uc5b8 \uc0dd\uc131, \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc561\uc158 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uad6c\uccb4\uc131 \ubc0f \ube44\uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \uc911\uac04 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uadfc\uc811\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc740 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4 \uc99d\ub958\uc640 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uc5b8 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0b0\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\uac1d \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub294 \uc81c\ud488\uc758 \uc57d\uc810\uacfc \ucda9\uc871\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774\ub098 \uce21\uba74 \ucd94\ucd9c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc790\uc720\ud615 \uc81c\uc548\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ucd9c\ub825\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uae4a\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub9ac\ubdf0 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc870\uc5b8\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub300\ud45c \ub9ac\ubdf0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad70\uc9d1\ud654, \uc870\uc5b8 \uc0dd\uc131, \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc21c\uc704\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc740 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4 \uc99d\ub958\uc640 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uc5b8 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uacc4\uc5f4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc561\uc158 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uad6c\uccb4\uc131 \ubc0f \ube44\uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \uc911\uac04 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uadfc\uc811\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Answering this question requires rigorous evaluation and effective mitigation, but existing approaches fall short on both fronts: evaluation methods force outputs into predefined cultural categories without a neutral option, while mitigation relies on expensive multi-cultural corpora or agent frameworks that use functional roles (e.g., Planner--Critique) lacking explicit cultural representation. To address these gaps, we introduce CEBiasBench, a Chinese--English bilingual benchmark, and Multi-Agent Vote (MAV), which enables explicit ``no bias'' judgments. Using this framework, we find that Chinese prompting merely shifts bias toward East Asian perspectives rather than eliminating it. To mitigate such persistent bias, we propose Multi-Agent Cultural Debate (MACD), a training-free framework that assigns agents distinct cultural personas and orchestrates deliberation via a \"Seeking Common Ground while Reserving Differences\" strategy. Experiments demonstrate that MACD achieves 57.6% average No Bias Rate evaluated by LLM-as-judge and 86.0% evaluated by MAV (vs. 47.6% and 69.0% baseline using GPT-4o as backbone) on CEBiasBench and generalizes to the Arabic CAMeL benchmark, confirming that explicit cultural representation in agent frameworks is essential for cross-cultural fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac04\uacfc\ub41c \ube44\uc11c\uad6c\uc801 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 \ube44\uc728 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubb38\ud654 \ub17c\uc7c1(MACD) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc11c\uad6c \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc11c\uad6c\uc801 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \uc774\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "CEBiasBench\ub77c\ub294 \uc911\uad6d-\uc601\uc5b4 \uc774\uc911 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 '\ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc5c6\uc74c' \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud22c\ud45c(MAV) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc911\uad6d\uc5b4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc544\uc2dc\uc544 \uad00\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc774\ud560 \ubfd0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\uc9c0\ub294 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

However, recent studies have shown that reasoning models suffer from overthinking attacks, where models are tricked to generate unnecessarily high number of reasoning tokens. In this paper, we reveal that such overthinking risk can be inherited by RAG systems equipped with reasoning models, by proposing an end-to-end attack framework named Contradiction-Based Deliberation Extension (CODE). Specifically, CODE develops a multi-agent architecture to construct poisoning samples that are injected into the knowledge base. These samples 1) are highly correlated with the use query, such that can be retrieved as inputs to the reasoning model; and 2) contain contradiction between the logical and evidence layers that cause models to overthink, and are optimized to exhibit highly diverse styles. Moreover, the inference overhead of CODE is extremely difficult to detect, as no modification is needed on the user query, and the task accuracy remain unaffected. Extensive experiments on two datasets across five commercial reasoning models demonstrate that the proposed attack causes a 5.32x-24.72x increase in reasoning token consumption, without degrading task performance. Finally, we also discuss and evaluate potential countermeasures to mitigate overthinking risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, CODE\ub77c\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba74 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CODE\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ud560 \uc720\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c 5.32\ubc30\uc5d0\uc11c 24.72\ubc30 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ub300\uc751\ucc45\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ucd94\ub860, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc790\uae30 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud558\uac8c \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc18d\uc774\ub294 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubc1d\ud600\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CODE\ub77c\ub294 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc0c1\uc18d\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, CODE\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ub420 \uc720\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc740 1) \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uba70 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uace0, 2) \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uce35\uacfc \uc99d\uac70 \uce35 \uac04\uc758 \ubaa8\uc21c\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba70, \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub3c4\ub85d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 CODE\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30\uac00 \uadf9\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \uc5c6\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c 5.32\ubc30\uc5d0\uc11c 24.72\ubc30 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ub300\uc751\ucc45\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paper consolidates and formalizes the technical composition of such systems, presenting a unified architectural framework that integrates planning, policy enforcement, state management, and quality operations into a coherent orchestration layer. Another primary contribution of this work is the in-depth technical delineation of two complementary communication protocols - the Model Context Protocol, which standardizes how agents access external tools and contextual data, and the Agent2Agent protocol, which governs peer coordination, negotiation, and delegation. Together, these protocols establish an interoperable communication substrate that enables scalable, auditable, and policy-compliant reasoning across distributed agent collectives. Beyond protocol design, the paper details how orchestration logic, governance frameworks, and observability mechanisms collectively sustain system coherence, transparency, and accountability.

This degradation, known as context rot, reflects a failure to maintain coherent and task-relevant internal states over extended reasoning horizons. Existing approaches primarily manage context through raw accumulation or passive summarization, treating it as a static artifact and allowing early errors or misplaced emphasis to persist. Motivated by this perspective, we propose ARC, which is the first framework to systematically formulate context management as an active, reflection-driven process that treats context as a dynamic internal reasoning state during execution. ARC operationalizes this view through reflection-driven monitoring and revision, allowing agents to actively reorganize their working context when misalignment or degradation is detected. Experiments on challenging long-horizon information-seeking benchmarks show that ARC consistently outperforms passive context compression methods, achieving up to an 11% absolute improvement in accuracy on BrowseComp-ZH with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARC\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubc18\uc131\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uccb4\uacc4\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uae34 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae34 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc720\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2e4\ud328\ud560 \ub54c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\uc2e0\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 ARC \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc18\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ARC\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc555\ucd95 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, BrowseComp-ZH\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ucd5c\ub300 11% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ARC\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae34 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uae34 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc800\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5 \ubd80\ud328(context rot)\ub77c\uace0 \ubd88\ub9ac\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc6d0\uc2dc \ucd95\uc801\uc774\ub098 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801 \uc694\uc57d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc815\uc801 \uc778\uacf5\ubb3c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uace0 \ucd08\uae30 \uc624\ub958\ub098 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uac15\uc870\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ARC\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc911\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ucd94\ub860 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubc18\uc131\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

By integrating the Random Forest classification algorithm from machine learning, attacks are assessed and predicted, dynamically adjusting the maximum pod parameter in the HPA to manage attack traffic. This approach enables the adjustment of HPA parameters using machine learning scripts in targeted attack scenarios while effectively managing attack traffic. All access from attacking IPs is redirected to honeypot pods, achieving a lower incidence of 5XX status codes through HPA pod adjustments under high load conditions. This method also ensures effective isolation of attack traffic, preventing excessive HPA expansion due to attacks. Additionally, experiments conducted under various conditions demonstrate the importance of setting appropriate thresholds for HPA adjustments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 HPA\uc5d0\uc11c HTTP \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ub79c\ub364 \ud3ec\ub808\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uacf5\uaca9 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c HPA\uc758 \ucd5c\ub300 \ud30c\ub4dc \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 HPA \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "HTTP \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ub79c\ub364 \ud3ec\ub808\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec HPA\uc758 \ucd5c\ub300 \ud30c\ub4dc \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacf5\uaca9 IP\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f \ud30c\ub4dc\ub85c \ub9ac\ub514\ub809\uc158\ub418\uba70, HPA \ud30c\ub4dc \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 5XX \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ub960\uc774 \ub0ae\uc544\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc801\uc808\ud55c HPA \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc124\uc815\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 HTTP \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c HPA \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub85c \uc0bc\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub79c\ub364 \ud3ec\ub808\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uba70, HPA\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 \ud30c\ub4dc \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec HPA \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uaca9 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uaca9 IP\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc811\uadfc\uc740 \ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f \ud30c\ub4dc\ub85c \ub9ac\ub514\ub809\uc158\ub418\uc5b4, \ub192\uc740 \ubd80\ud558 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c HPA \ud30c\ub4dc \uc870\uc815\uc73c\ub85c 5XX \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucf54\ub4dc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ub960\uc774 \ub0ae\uc544\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c HPA\uc758 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 HPA \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc124\uc815\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are no longer used only as passive knowledge engines but as cognitive controllers that combine memory, tool use, and feedback from their environment to pursue extended goals. This shift already supports the automation of complex workflows in software engineering, scientific discovery, and web navigation, yet the variety of emerging designs, from simple single loop agents to hierarchical multi agent systems, makes the landscape hard to navigate. In this paper, we investigate architectures and propose a unified taxonomy that breaks agents into Perception, Brain, Planning, Action, Tool Use, and Collaboration. We use this lens to describe the move from linear reasoning procedures to native inference time reasoning models, and the transition from fixed API calls to open standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Native Computer Use. We also group the environments in which these agents operate, including digital operating systems, embodied robotics, and other specialized domains, and we review current evaluation practices.

Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "TIDE\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ubc0f \ub85c\ubd07\uacf5\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc784\ubb34\ub97c \ub354 \uc791\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 LTLf \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud074\ub798\uc2dd \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "TIDE\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub354 \uc791\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc6a9 \uae30\ubc18 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TIDE\ub294 \uc608\ube44 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TIDE\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud3ec\uad04\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c(TEG)\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 AI\uc640 \ub85c\ubd07\uacf5\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc2dc\uac04 \uacbd\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ud55c \uada4\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(LTLf)\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 LTLf \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub3c4\ub2ec \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc548\ub0b4\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 TIDE(Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Compared to text-based applications, their security is far more critical: a successful prompt injection attack does not just alter outputs but can directly misguide physical navigation, leading to unsafe routes, mission failure, or real-world harm. Despite this high-stakes setting, the vulnerability of navigation agents to prompt injection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose PINA, an adaptive prompt optimization framework tailored to navigation agents under black-box, long-context, and action-executable constraints. Experiments on indoor and outdoor navigation agents show that PINA achieves high attack success rates with an average ASR of 87.5%, surpasses all baselines, and remains robust under ablation and adaptive-attack conditions. This work provides the first systematic investigation of prompt injection attacks in navigation and highlights their urgent security implications for embodied LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc0bd\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccab \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, PINA\ub77c\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "PINA\ub294 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4, \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "PINA\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 ASR 87.5%\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \uc801\uc751 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc0bd\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc0ac \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc81c\uc2dc\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae34\uae09\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs) \uae30\ubc18 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc751\uc6a9\ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc0bd\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ucd9c\ub825\ub9cc \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc798\ubabb \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uacbd\ub85c, \uc784\ubb34 \uc2e4\ud328 \ub610\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc0bd\uc785\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc740 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4, \uc7a5\uae30 \ub9e5\ub77d \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucda4\ud654\ub41c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 PINA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ub0b4 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc678 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, PINA\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 ASR 87.5%\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \ubd84\ud574 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc0bd\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccab \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uad6c\ud604\ub41c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae34\uae09\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Building on earlier work that introduced a four-metric Total Injection Vulnerability Score (TIVS), this paper extends the evaluation framework with semantic similarity-based caching and a fifth metric (Observability Score Ratio) to yield TIVS-O, investigating how defence effectiveness interacts with transparency in a HOPE-inspired Nested Learning architecture. The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM

FutureX-Pro targets four economically and socially pivotal verticals: Finance, Retail, Public Health, and Natural Disaster. We benchmark agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on entry-level yet foundational prediction tasks -- ranging from forecasting market indicators and supply chain demands to tracking epidemic trends and natural disasters. By adapting the contamination-free, live-evaluation pipeline of FutureX, we assess whether current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) agentic LLMs possess the domain grounding necessary for industrial deployment.

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines. The results highlight the importance of structured temporal representations and show that decoupling local temporal encoding from global attention-based modelling yields more effective and stable

Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating the functional correctness of LLM-generated code, yet paid limited attention to its security issues. However, LLM-generated code that appears functionally sound may embed security flaws which could induce catastrophic damages after deployment. This critical research gap motivates us to design a benchmark for assessing security awareness under realistic specifications. In this work, we introduce HardSecBench, a benchmark with 924 tasks spanning Verilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) and firmware-level C, covering 76 hardware-relevant Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entries. Each task includes a structured specification, a secure reference implementation, and executable tests. To automate artifact synthesis, we propose a multi-agent pipeline that decouples synthesis from verification and grounds evaluation in execution evidence, enabling reliable evaluation. Using HardSecBench, we evaluate a range of LLMs on hardware and firmware code generation and find that models often satisfy functional requirements while still leaving security risks. We also find that security results vary with prompting. These findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in LLM-assisted hardware design.

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud300 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud300\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud300 \uac08\ub4f1 \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "600\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5 \ucf54\ub529 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 CooperBench\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud300\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c \ud3c9\uade0 30% \ub0ae\uc740 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ud300\uacfc\ub294 \ub300\uc870\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud611\uc5c5 \ucf54\ub529\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud300 \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uacf5\ud1b5\uc810\uc744 \ucc3e\uace0 \ud569\uc758\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.

This leads to two major challenges: the lack of manual annotations for model adaptation and the difficulty for pretrained models to stay up-to-date with domain-specific facts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong zero-shot abilities, they still suffer from hallucination and limited domain grounding. In contrast, discriminative Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) provide reliable grounding but require costly annotations to cover new domains. We introduce Docs2Synth, a synthetic-supervision framework that enables retrieval-guided inference for private and low-resource domains. Docs2Synth automatically processes raw document collections, generates and verifies diverse QA pairs via an agent-based system, and trains a lightweight visual retriever to extract domain-relevant evidence. During inference, the retriever collaborates with an MLLM through an iterative retrieval--generation loop, reducing hallucination and improving response consistency. We further deliver Docs2Synth as an easy-to-use Python package, enabling plug-and-play deployment across diverse real-world scenarios. Experiments on multiple VRDU benchmarks show that Docs2Synth substantially enhances grounding and domain generalization without requiring human annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Docs2Synth\ub294 \uaddc\uc81c\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc11c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc11c \uceec\ub809\uc158\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc9c8\uc758-\uc751\ub2f5 \uc30d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad00\ub828 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\uce94\ub41c \ubb38\uc11c\ub4e4\uc774 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uace0 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uaddc\uc81c\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubb38\uc11c \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "Docs2Synth\ub294 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ubb38\uc11c \uceec\ub809\uc158\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c QA \uc30d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad00\ub828 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \ub9ac\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc84\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Docs2Synth\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec VRDU \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Docs2Synth\ub294 \uc778\ub825\uc774 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc5c5\uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uaddc\uc81c\ub41c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubb38\uc11c \uc774\ud574(VRDU)\ub294 \uc2a4\uce94\ub41c \ubb38\uc11c\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uace0 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\uba70 \ubd84\uc57c \ud2b9\uc815 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc218\ub3d9 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd84\uc57c \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc2e0\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud658\uac01\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubd84\uc57c grounding\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, \uad6c\ubcc4\uc801 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub378(VLPM)\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 grounding\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc744 \ucee4\ubc84\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Docs2Synth\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum. Empirically, we test the base policy prediction algorithm in both simulated games and MAPPO for complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c

This paper presents an architecture that extends the European Union eIDAS trust framework into public blockchain ecosystems by cryptographically binding smart contracts to qualified electronic seals issued by Qualified Trust Service Providers. The mechanism establishes a verifiable chain of trust from the European Commission List of Trusted Lists to individual on-chain addresses, enabling machine-verifiable proofs for automated regulatory validation, such as Know Your Contract, Counterparty, and Business checks, without introducing new trusted intermediaries. Regulatory requirements arising from eIDAS, MiCA, PSD2, PSR, and the proposed European Business Wallet are analyzed, and a cryptographic suite meeting both eIDAS implementing regulations and EVM execution constraints following the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade is identified, namely ECDSA with P-256 and CAdES formatting. Two complementary trust validation models are presented: an off-chain workflow for agent-to-agent payment protocols and a fully on-chain workflow enabling regulatory-compliant DeFi operations between legal entities. The on-chain model converts regulatory compliance from a per-counterparty administrative burden into an automated, standardized process, enabling mutual validation at first interaction without prior business relationships. As eIDAS wallets become mandatory across EU member states, the proposed architecture provides a pathway for integrating European digital trust infrastructure into blockchain-based systems, enabling institutional DeFi participation, real-world asset tokenization, and agentic commerce within a trusted, regulatory-compliant framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc720\ub7fd

This paper introduces TruthTensor, a novel, reproducible evaluation paradigm that measures Large Language Models (LLMs) not only as prediction engines but as human-imitation systems operating in socially-grounded, high-entropy environments. Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts.

However, there is a lack of systematic and reliable evaluation benchmarks for PRMs in tool-using settings. In this paper, we introduce ToolPRMBench, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate PRMs for tool-using agents. ToolPRMBench is built on top of several representative tool-using benchmarks and converts agent trajectories into step-level test cases. Each case contains the interaction history, a correct action, a plausible but incorrect alternative, and relevant tool metadata. We respectively utilize offline sampling to isolate local single-step errors and online sampling to capture realistic multi-step failures from full agent rollouts. A multi-LLM verification pipeline is proposed to reduce label noise and ensure data quality. We conduct extensive experiments across large language models, general PRMs, and tool-specialized PRMs on ToolPRMBench. The results reveal clear differences in PRM effectiveness and highlight the potential of specialized PRMs for tool-using.

In this problem, a central authority must decide, in real time, when to charge dynamically arriving electric vehicles (EVs), subject to capacity limits, with the objective of balancing load across a finite planning horizon. To solve the problem, we first gamify it; that is, we model it as a game where charging blocks are placed within temporal and capacity constraints on a grid. We design heuristic policies, train learning agents with expert demonstrations, and improve them using Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). From a theoretical standpoint, we show that gamification reduces model complexity and yields tighter generalization bounds than vector-based formulations. Experiments across multiple EV arrival patterns confirm that gamified learning enhances load balancing. In particular, the image-to-movement model trained with DAgger consistently outperforms heuristic baselines, vector-based approaches, and supervised learning agents, while also demonstrating robustness in sensitivity analyses. These operational gains translate into tangible economic value. In a real-world case study for the Greater Montr\u00e9al Area (Qu\u00e9bec, Canada) using utility cost data, the proposed methods lower system costs by tens of millions of dollars per year over the

Despite advances in digitalization, official documents remain vulnerable to forgery, loss, and unauthorized access. This thesis proposes a decentralized infrastructure for digital notarization, signing, and sharing of documents using blockchain technology. The research addresses key issues of transparency, immutability, and feasibility by defining system requirements, evaluating existing solutions, and proposing a novel architecture based on distributed systems.\n  By combining cryptographic techniques with decentralized storage, this research contributes to the development of a more secure and efficient framework for managing official documents. The findings highlight the potential of blockchain-based digital notarization to streamline bureaucratic processes, mitigate security risks, and enhance user trust in digital document management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc11c \uc778\uc99d, \uc11c\uba85 \ubc0f \uacf5\uc720 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uc2dd \ubb38\uc11c \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc885\uc774 \ubb38\uc11c \uad00\ub9ac \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548, \uc9c4\uc704 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uad00\ub828 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uae30\ud574\uc654\ub2e4. \ub514\uc9c0\ud138\ud654\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uc2dd \ubb38\uc11c\ub294 \uc704\uc870, \uc190\uc2e4 \ubc0f \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud22c\uba85\uc131, \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc554\ud638\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec, \uacf5\uc2dd \ubb38\uc11c \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc778\uc99d\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uad00\ub8cc\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba70 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ubb38\uc11c \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc885\uc774 \uae30\ubc18 \ubb38\uc11c \uad00\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548, \uc9c4\uc704 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc624\ub7ab\ub3d9\uc548 \uc548\uace0 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub514\uc9c0\ud138\ud654\uac00 \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uc2dd \ubb38\uc11c\ub294 \uc704\uc870, \uc190\uc2e4 \ubc0f \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc778\uc99d, \uc11c\uba85 \ubc0f \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud22c\uba85\uc131, \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc800\uc7a5\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacf5\uc2dd \ubb38\uc11c \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc778\uc99d\uc774 \uad00\ub8cc\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba70 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ubb38\uc11c \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We present LLMOrbit, a comprehensive circular taxonomy navigating the landscape of large language models spanning 2019-2025. This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at <$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%).

However, existing large language model training methods primarily allow models to learn from existing textual content or solve predetermined problems, lacking experience in real scenarios involving interaction, negotiation, and competition with others. To address this, this paper proposes Multi-Agent Reward Optimization (MARO), a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire stronger reasoning abilities by learning and practicing in multi-agent social environments. Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following. This reveals the tremendous potential of multi-agent social learning in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911

Submitted and accepted in AAAI-26 (IAAI Emerging Applications track)", "summary": "Future direct-imaging flagship missions, such as NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), face critical decisions in prioritizing observations due to extremely stringent time and resource constraints. In this paper, we introduce two advanced machine-learning architectures tailored for predicting biosignature species fluxes from exoplanetary reflected-light spectra: a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) and our novel model architecture, the Spectral Query Adaptive Transformer (SQuAT). The BCNN robustly quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, offering reliable predictions under diverse observational conditions, whereas SQuAT employs query-driven attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability by explicitly associating spectral features with specific biosignature species. We demonstrate that both models achieve comparably high predictive accuracy on an augmented dataset spanning a wide range of exoplanetary conditions, while highlighting their distinct advantages in uncertainty quantification and spectral interpretability. These capabilities position our methods as promising tools for accelerating target triage, optimizing observation schedules, and maximizing scientific return for upcoming flagship missions such as HWO.", "AI": {"tldr": "NASA\uc758 Habitable Worlds Observatory\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc791 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc784\ubb34\ub294 \uadf9\ub3c4\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uc790\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uad00\uce21 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uba85 \uc9c0\ud45c \uc885\uc758 \ud50c\ub7ed\uc2a4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uad00\uce21\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) \ubc0f Spectral Query Adaptive Transformer (SQuAT)\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uace0\uae09 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub450 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubaa8\ub450 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc678\uacc4 \ud589\uc131 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd84\ub958, \uad00\uce21 \uc77c\uc815 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uc8fc\uc694 \uc784\ubb34\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc218\uc775 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\uc5d0 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\ub9e4\uae40\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc791 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc784\ubb34, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 NASA\uc758 Habitable Worlds Observatory(HWO)\ub294 \uadf9\ub3c4\ub85c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uad00\uce21\uc758 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc678\uacc4 \ud589\uc131 \ubc18\uc0ac\uad11 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0dd\uba85 \uc9c0\ud45c \uc885 \ud50c\ub7ed\uc2a4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uace0\uae09 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN)\uacfc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Spectral Query Adaptive Transformer (SQuAT)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

It is concerning whether their strong problem-solving abilities may be misused for crimes. To address this gap, we propose VirtualCrime, a sandbox simulation framework based on a three-agent system to evaluate the criminal capabilities of models. Specifically, this framework consists of an attacker agent acting as the leader of a criminal team, a judge agent determining the outcome of each action, and a world manager agent updating the environment state and entities. Furthermore, we design 40 diverse crime tasks within this framework, covering 11 maps and 13 crime objectives such as theft, robbery, kidnapping, and riot. We also introduce a human player baseline for reference to better interpret the performance of LLM agents. We evaluate 8 strong LLMs and find (1) All agents in the simulation environment compliantly generate detailed plans and execute intelligent crime processes, with some achieving relatively high success rates; (2) In some cases, agents take severe action that inflicts harm to NPCs to achieve their goals.

However, existing models generally do not explicitly model seekers' emotion shifts across counseling sessions, a core focus in classical psychological schools. Moreover, how to align counselor models' responses with these emotion shifts while proactively mitigating safety risks remains underexplored. To bridge these gaps, we propose Psych\u0113Chat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling. Specifically, we employ interactive role-playing to synthesize counselor--seeker dialogues, incorporating two modules: Emotion Management Module, to capture seekers' current emotions and emotion shifts; and Risk Control Module, to anticipate seekers' subsequent reactions and identify potential risks. Furthermore, we introduce two modeling paradigms. The Agent Mode structures emotion management, risk control, and counselor responses into a collaborative multi-agent pipeline. The LLM Mode integrates these stages into a unified chain-of-thought for end-to-end inference, balancing efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments, including interactive scoring, dialogue-level evaluation, and human assessment, demonstrate that Psych\u0113Chat outperforms existing methods for emotional insight and safety control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f4 \uc138\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uc815 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 Psych\u0113Chat\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f4 \uc138\uc158 \uac04\uc758 \uac10\uc815 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uace0\uc804 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ud3ec\ucee4\uc2a4\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \ub864\ud50c\ub808\uc789\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc790\uc640 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac10\uc815 \uad00\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Psych\u0113Chat\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac10\uc815 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uacfc \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Psych\u0113Chat\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub69c\ub837\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc2ec\ub9ac \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad04\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc654\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f4 \uc138\uc158 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc790\uc758 \uac10\uc815 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uace0\uc804 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559 \ud559\uad50\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ucd08\uc810 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc774\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac10\uc815 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Psych\u0113Chat\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2ec\ub9ac \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac10\uc815 \ubcc0\ud654 \ucd94\uc801 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub864\ud50c\ub808\uc789\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc790\uc640 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc790\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uac10\uc815\uacfc \uac10\uc815 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \uad00\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc790\uc758 \uc774\ud6c4 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \uad00\ub9ac, \uc704\ud5d8 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc790 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.

In particular, the widely used softmax parameterization can induce ill-conditioned optimization landscapes and lead to exponentially slow convergence. Although this can be mitigated by preconditioning, this solution is often computationally expensive. Instead, we propose replacing the softmax with an alternative family of policy parameterizations based on the generalized f-softargmax. We further advocate coupling this parameterization with a regularizer induced by the same f-divergence, which improves the optimization landscape and ensures that the resulting regularized objective satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Leveraging this structure, we establish the first explicit non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic policy gradient methods for finite MDPs without any form of preconditioning. We also derive sample-complexity bounds for the unregularized problem and show that f-PG, with Tsallis divergences achieves polynomial sample complexity in contrast to the exponential complexity incurred by the standard softmax parameterization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\ucc45 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 softmax \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c f-softargmax\ub85c \uad50\uccb4\ud558\uace0 f-\ubc1c\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uae30\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacbd\uad00\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574", "method": "softmax \ub300\uc2e0\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c f-softargmax\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c f-\ubc1c\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uae30\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubb34\uc815\ud615 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc5c6\uc774 \uc720\ud55c MDPs\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ube44\ube44\ub300\uce6d \ucd5c\uc885 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "f-PG \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 softmax \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc9c0\uc218 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub2e4\ud56d \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\ucc45 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 softmax \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub294 \uc88b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc870\uac74\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacbd\uad00\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub290\ub9b0 \uc218\ub834\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uc2e0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 softmax\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c f-softargmax\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654 \uacc4\uc5f4\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc774 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub97c \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c f-\ubc1c\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uae30\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacbd\uad00\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ud3f4\ub9ac\uc545-\ub85c\uc790\uc608\ube44\uce58 \ubd88\ud3c9\ub4f1\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \uc5c6\uc774 \uc720\ud55c MDP\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ube44\ube44\ub300\uce6d \ucd5c\uc885 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc124\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ube44\uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, f-PG\uac00 Tsallis \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ud56d \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 softmax \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc9c0\uc218 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc640 \ub300\uc870\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, due to the fact that existing tools typically rely on agents installed on target systems, they leave suspicious traces that make it easy to distinguish their activities from those of real human attackers. Moreover, these tools often lack relevant capabilities, such as handling of interactive prompts, and are unsuitable for emulating specific stages of the kill chain, such as initial access. This paper thus introduces AttackMate, an open-source attack scripting language and execution engine designed to mimic behavior patterns of actual attackers. We validate the tool in a case study covering common attack steps including privilege escalation, information gathering, and lateral movement. Our results indicate that log artifacts resulting from AttackMate's activities resemble those produced by human attackers more closely than those generated by standard adversary emulation tools.",

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc751\uc6a9\ubd84\uc57c \ubc0f \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud3d0\uc1c4\uc801\uc778 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\ubc29\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce35\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uba70, \uac01 \uce35\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825, \uc790\uae30 \ubc1c\uc804\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654, \uc7a5\uae30 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9, \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub4f1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ucd94\ub860, \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc815\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uc138\uacc4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\ubc29\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 LLMs\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0 \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\uba70 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\ud68d, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860;

Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb34\uc120 \ucda9\ub3cc \ucc44\ub110\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud1b5\uc2e0\ud558\ub294 \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uce90\uc2f1\ud558\uace0, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud3c9\uade0 \ucd94\uc815 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ub354 \ud070 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc5d0 \uac15\ud558\uba70, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud568\uc744 \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub178\ub4dc\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uce90\uc2f1\ud558\uace0 \ubb34\uc120 \ucda9\ub3cc \ucc44\ub110\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud1b5\uc2e0\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud3c9\uade0 \ucd94\uc815 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc131\uacfc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574, \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uc774\uc2dd \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 (i) \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0;

Two operational modes support different workflows: semi-autonomous mode with selective human checkpoints, and fully autonomous mode for extended investigations. Evaluation on the BixBench computational biology benchmark demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving 48.8% accuracy on open response and 64.5% on multiple-choice evaluation, exceeding existing baselines by 14 to 26 percentage points.

By selecting and integrating appropriate tools, LLMs extend their capabilities beyond pure language understanding to perform specialized functions. However, existing methods for tool selection often focus on limited tool sets and struggle to generalize to novel tools encountered in practical deployments. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive dataset spanning 7 domains, containing 155 tools and 9,377 question-answer pairs, which simulates realistic integration scenarios. Additionally, we propose MetaToolAgent (MTA), a meta-learning approach designed to improve cross-tool generalization.

Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\\to$ perception $\\to$ inference $\\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($\u03b5$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc784\uc0c1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc608\uce21 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \ucd94\ub860\uc740

DBS involves stimulating specific regions of the brain's Basal Ganglia (BG) using electric impulses to alleviate symptoms of PD such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Although most clinical DBS approaches today use a fixed frequency and amplitude, they suffer from side effects (such as slurring of speech) and shortened battery life of the implant. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome. These RL algorithms are, however, too complex to be trained in vivo due to their long convergence time and requirement of high computational resources.\n  We propose a new Time & Threshold-Triggered Multi-Armed Bandit (T3P MAB) RL approach for DBS that is more effective than existing algorithms. Further, our T3P agent is lightweight enough to be deployed in the implant, unlike current deep-RL strategies, and even forgoes the need for an offline training phase. Additionally, most existing RL approaches have focused on modulating only frequency or amplitude, and the possibility of tuning them together remains greatly unexplored in the literature. Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge.

Submitted to Operations Research", "summary": "Estimating the unknown reward functions driving agents' behaviors is of central interest in inverse reinforcement learning and game theory. To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions. Our algorithm works in both static and dynamic settings and is adaptable to incorporate different methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the reliability and sample efficiency of our algorithm. Further, we conduct extensive numerical studies to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework, offering new insights into decision-making in competitive environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, \ub450 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \ucd94\uc815\uc740 \uc5ed \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uc2ec\uc0ac\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub450 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4 \uac8c\uc784 \ubc0f \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc591\uc790 \uc751\ub2f5 \ud3c9\ud615(QRE)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \uc124\uc815 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 \uc6b0\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815(MLE)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uacbd\uc7c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294\u672a\u77e5 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ucd94\uc815\uc740 \uc5ed \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc2ec\uc801 \uad00\uc2ec\uc0ac\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131, \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \ube44\uc720\uc77c\uc131, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uad00\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub36e\uac1c \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc591\uc790 \uc751\ub2f5 \ud3c9\ud615(QRE)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \uc124\uc815 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 \uc6b0\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815(MLE)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc801 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc218\uce58 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\uc7c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While recent interactive benchmarks have introduced dynamic scenarios, they often remain fragmented and coarse-grained, failing to capture the structured inquiry logic and diagnostic rigor required in professional consultations. To bridge this gap, we propose MedConsultBench, a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate the complete online consultation cycle by covering the entire clinical workflow from history taking and diagnosis to treatment planning and follow-up Q\\&A. Our methodology introduces Atomic Information Units (AIUs) to track clinical information acquisition at a sub-turn level, enabling precise monitoring of how key facts are elicited through 22 fine-grained metrics. By addressing the underspecification and ambiguity inherent in online consultations, the benchmark evaluates uncertainty-aware yet concise inquiry while emphasizing medication regimen compatibility and the ability to handle realistic post-prescription follow-up Q\\&A via constraint-respecting plan revisions. Systematic evaluation of 19 large language models reveals that high diagnostic accuracy often masks significant deficiencies in information-gathering efficiency and medication safety.

The proposed Hierarchical Attribution Graph Decomposition (HAGD) framework reduces circuit discovery complexity from O(2^n) exhaustive enumeration to O(n^2 log n) through multi-resolution abstraction hierarchies and differentiable circuit search. The methodology integrates cross-layer transcoders for monosemantic feature extraction, graph neural network meta-learning for topology prediction, and causal intervention protocols for validation. Empirical evaluation spans GPT-2 variants, Llama-7B through Llama-70B, and Pythia suite models across algorithmic tasks and natural language benchmarks.

However, not all reflections are beneficial-many are superficial, offering little to no improvement over the original answer and incurring computation overhead. In this paper, we identify and address the problem of superficial reflection in LRMs. We first propose Self-Critique Fine-Tuning (SCFT), a training framework that enhances the model's reflective reasoning ability using only self-generated critiques. SCFT prompts models to critique their own outputs, filters high-quality critiques through rejection sampling, and fine-tunes the model using a critique-based objective. Building on this strong foundation, we further introduce Reinforcement Learning with Effective Reflection Rewards (RLERR). RLERR leverages the high-quality reflections initialized by SCFT to construct reward signals, guiding the model to internalize the self-correction process via reinforcement learning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, AIME2024 and AIME2025, show that SCFT and RLERR significantly improve both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

However, most TTA methods are designed for independent data, often overlooking the time series data and rarely addressing forecasting tasks. This paper presents AdaNODEs, an innovative source-free TTA method tailored explicitly for time series forecasting. By leveraging Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), we propose a novel adaptation framework that accommodates the unique characteristics of distribution shifts in time series data.

This autonomy introduces serious security risks: malicious instructions or visual prompt injections can trigger unsafe reasoning and cause harmful system-level actions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based blocking, prevent damage but often abort tasks prematurely, reducing agent utility. In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR. Our work proves that simulation-derived defenses can provide robust, real-world protection while maintaining the fundamental utility of the agent.

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has therefore spurred interest in autonomous agents that can read scientific papers and extract task-relevant information. However, most existing approaches rely either on heavily engineered prompting or on a conventional SFT-RL training pipeline, both of which often lead to excessive and low-yield exploration. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process. Experiments on paper-based question answering (Paper-QA) benchmarks show that PaperCompass improves efficiency over strong baselines without sacrificing performance, achieving results comparable to much larger models.", "AI": {"tldr": "PaperCompass\ub294 \uacfc\ud559 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc77d\uace0 \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc138\ubd80 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacfc\ud559 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc84c\uc73c\uba70, LLM\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubd88\ub7ec\uc77c\uc73c\ucf30\ub2e4.", "method": "PaperCompass\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ucd08\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 RL \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ucd08\uc548 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \ucd5c\uc885 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PaperCompass\ub294 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DFPO\ub294 LLM\uc758 '\uc54c\uace0 \ud558\uae30' \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc881\ud788\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacfc\ud559 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc218\ub3d9 \ub3c5\uc11c\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uacfc\ud559 \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \uc77d\uace0 \uacfc\uc5c5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uc790\uadf9\ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub610\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 SFT-RL \ud6c8\ub828 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc218\uc775\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc138\ubd80 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 PaperCompass\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

This occurs because current pipelines sample candidate steps from generic prompts or learned policies with weak domain priors, yielding near-random walks over operators, units, and formats. To promote ordered exploration, this paper introduces SCULPT, a constraint-guided approach for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that integrates domain-aware scoring into selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths. Under matched LLM configurations, SCULPT yields stable improvements on multiple datasets; additional results with GPT-5.2 assess executor transferability and performance on frontier reasoning models. Overall, domain-aware constraints can improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency and reasoning stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc790\uc8fc \ubc97\uc5b4\ub09c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c SCULPT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "SCULPT\ub294 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\ud0dd, \ud655\uc7a5, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158, \uc5ed\uc804\ud30c \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc57d \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SCULPT\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c GPT-5.2\uc640\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589\uc790\uc758 \uc774\uc2dd\uc131\uacfc \ucd5c\uc804\uc120 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd \uc81c\uc57d\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc790\uc8fc \uc774\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub098 \uc57d\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790, \ub2e8\uc704 \ubc0f \ud615\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uadfc\uc811\ud55c \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc120\ud0dd, \ud655\uc7a5, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uc5ed\uc804\ud30c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc548\ub0b4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c SCULPT\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We pre-processed and segmented the microscopic images to ensure the extraction of high-quality features. To ensure the reliability of our proposed system, we conducted an in-depth analysis of interpretability. Leveraging techniques established in the literature, we extracted features from blood cells and employed ensemble machine learning methods to classify their morphology. Furthermore, we have devised a methodology to identify the most critical features for classification, aimed at reducing complexity and training time and enhancing interpretability in opaque models. Lastly, we validated our results using a new dataset, where our model overperformed state-of-the-art models in terms of generalization. The results of classifier ensembled of Random Forest and Extra Trees classifier achieved an harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1-score) of 90.71\\% and a Sickle Cell Disease diagnosis support score (SDS-score) of 93.33\\%. These results demonstrate notable enhancement from previous ones with Gradient Boosting classifier (F1-score 87.32\\% and SDS-score 89.51\\%).

It is built on top of answer set programming (ASP) and transition systems to represent how human mental states evolve in response to sequences of observable actions. Drawing on well-established psychological theories, such as the Appraisal Theory of Emotion, we formalize mental states, such as emotions, as multi-dimensional configurations. With the objective to address the need for controlled agent behaviors and to restrict unwanted mental side-effects of actions, we extend the language with a novel causal rule, forbids to cause, along with expressions specialized for mental state dynamics, which enables the modeling of principles for valid transitions between mental states. These principles of mental change are translated into transition constraints, and properties of invariance, which are rigorously evaluated using transition systems in terms of so-called trajectories. This enables controlled reasoning about the dynamic evolution of human mental states. Furthermore, the framework supports the comparison of different dynamics of change by analyzing trajectories that adhere to different psychological principles. We apply the action language to design models for emotion verification.

We ask whether an AI mentor can move undergraduates from an idea to a paper. We build METIS, a tool-augmented, stage-aware assistant with literature search, curated guidelines, methodology checks, and memory. We evaluate METIS against GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 across six writing stages using LLM-as-a-judge pairwise preferences, student-persona rubrics, short multi-turn tutoring, and evidence/compliance checks. On 90 single-turn prompts, LLM judges preferred METIS to Claude Sonnet 4.5 in 71% and to GPT-5 in 54%.

However, two central challenges remain unresolved: automating the evaluation of agent trajectories and generating high-quality training data at scale to enable continual improvement. Existing approaches often depend on manual annotation or static rule-based verification, which restricts scalability and limits adaptability in dynamic environments. We present MagicGUI-RMS, a multi-agent reward model system that delivers adaptive trajectory evaluation, corrective feedback, and self-evolving learning capabilities. MagicGUI-RMS integrates a Domain-Specific Reward Model (DS-RM) with a General-Purpose Reward Model (GP-RM), enabling fine-grained action assessment and robust generalization across heterogeneous GUI tasks. To support reward learning at scale, we design a structured data construction pipeline that automatically produces balanced and diverse reward datasets, effectively reducing annotation costs while maintaining sample fidelity. During execution, the reward model system identifies erroneous actions, proposes refined alternatives, and continuously enhances agent behavior through an automated data-reflux mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicGUI-RMS yields substantial gains in task accuracy, behavioral robustness. These results establish MagicGUI-RMS as a principled and effective foundation for building self-improving GUI agents driven by reward-based adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MagicGUI-RMS\ub294 \uc790\uc728 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacbd\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00, \uc218\uc815 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ubc0f \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MagicGUI-RMS\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ubc94\uc6a9 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MagicGUI-RMS\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MagicGUI-RMS\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc801\uc751\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589\uc744 \ud5a5\ud574 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc640 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc8fc\uc11d \ub610\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacbd\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00, \uc218\uc815 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ubc0f \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 MagicGUI-RMS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and unified evaluation of reasoning paradigms, spanning direct single-model generation, CoT-augmented single-model reasoning, and representative MAS workflows, characterizing their reasoning performance across a diverse suite of closed-form benchmarks. Beyond overall performance, we probe role-specific capability demands in MAS using targeted role isolation analyses, and analyze cost-accuracy trade-offs to identify which MAS workflows offer a favorable balance between cost and accuracy, and which incur prohibitive overhead for marginal gains. We further introduce MIMeBench, a new open-ended benchmark that targets two foundational yet underexplored semantic capabilities - semantic abstraction and contrastive discrimination - thereby providing an alternative evaluation axis beyond closed-form accuracy and enabling fine-grained assessment of semantic competence that is difficult to capture with existing benchmarks. Our results show that increased structural complexity does not consistently lead to improved reasoning performance, with its benefits being highly dependent on the properties and suitability of the reasoning paradigm itself.

Current LLM architectures and evaluation protocols rarely test for temporal awareness under real-time deadlines. We use simulated negotiations between paired agents under strict deadlines to investigate how LLMs adjust their behavior in time-sensitive settings. In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\\% vs. 4\\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time. However, the same LLMs achieve near-perfect deal closure rates ($\\geq$95\\%) under turn-based limits, revealing the failure is in temporal tracking rather than strategic reasoning. These effects replicate across negotiation scenarios and models, illustrating a systematic lack of LLM time awareness that will constrain LLM deployment in many time-sensitive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uae30\ud55c \uc774\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 LLM\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uae30\ud55c \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uc30d\uc744 \uc774\ub8ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud611\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\ub798 \uc131\uc0ac\uc728\uc774 32%\ub85c, \ud1b5\uc81c \uc870\uac74\uc758 4%\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc740 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\uc801 \uc2e4\ud328\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 LLM \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc62c \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uce58\ub8cc \uc138\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 LLM \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub9c8\uac10 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uac70\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uae30\ud55c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc30d\uc744 \uc774\ub8ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud611\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\ub2e4. \ud1b5\uc81c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc804\uc5ed \uc2dc\uac04 \ud55c\ub3c4\ub9cc \uc54c\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01 \ud134\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ub0a8\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4. \uac70\ub798 \uc131\uc0ac\uc728\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c 32% (GPT-5.1\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 4%)\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc558\uace0, \uc81c\uc548 \uc218\ub77d\ub960\uc740 \ud1b5\uc81c \uc870\uac74\ubcf4\ub2e4 6\ubc30 \ub192\uc558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uacbd\uacfc\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c LLM\uc740 \ud134 \uae30\ubc18 \ud55c\ub3c4 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\uc758 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uac70\ub798 \uc131\uc0ac\uc728(\u226595%)\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\uc801\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \ud611\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba70, \uc774\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd \ubd80\uc871\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d\ud560 \uac83\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism. Beyond neuroscience, we validate GeoDynamics on human action recognition benchmarks (UTKinect, Florence, HDM05), demonstrating its scalability and robustness in modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics across diverse domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoDynamics\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub300\uce6d \uc591\uc758 \uc815\ubd80\ud638(SPD) \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub1cc \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub1cc\ub97c \ub290\uc2a8\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc6b0\uc120 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud640\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uae30 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654\ub41c \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ub193\uce58\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "GeoDynamics\ub294 \uac01 \uc5f0\uacb0 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uace0 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \uc874\uc911\ud558\ub294 \uc804\uc774\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc911\uc2ec \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38\ubcd1, \ud30c\ud0a8\uc2a8\ubcd1 \ubc0f \uc790\ud3d0\uc99d\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \ubc1d\ud78c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GeoDynamics\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc5ed\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4\uace0 \uacb0\ub860\uc9c0\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378(SSMs)\uc740 \ub1cc \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\ub294 \ucd08\uc11d\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uad00\uce21\ub41c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uae4a\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc SSM\uc758 \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc801 \ub3d9\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc801\ud569\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \ub1cc\ub97c \ub290\uc2a8\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc601\uc5ed\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc6b0\uc120 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uccb4\ub860\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\uae30 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654\ub41c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub1cc \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131(FC)\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ub300\uce6d \uc591\uc758 \uc815\ubd80\ud638(SPD) \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uace1\uba74 \ub9ac\ub9cc \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c SPD \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc778\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud575\uc2ec\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 SPD \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ub1cc \uc0c1\ud0dc \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc778 GeoDynamics\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively.

In this setting, model merging offers a practical mechanism for integrating multiple RL-trained agents from different tasks into a single generalist model. However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models.

This work introduces a multi-agent refinement framework designed to enhance the safety and reliability of medical LLMs through structured, iterative alignment. Our system combines two generative models - DeepSeek R1 and Med-PaLM - with two evaluation agents, LLaMA 3.1 and Phi-4, which assess responses using the American Medical Association's (AMA) Principles of Medical Ethics and a five-tier Safety Risk Assessment (SRA-5) protocol. We evaluate performance across 900 clinically diverse queries spanning nine ethical domains, measuring convergence efficiency, ethical violation reduction, and domain-specific risk behavior. Results demonstrate that DeepSeek R1 achieves faster convergence (mean 2.34 vs. 2.67 iterations), while Med-PaLM shows superior handling of privacy-sensitive scenarios. The iterative multi-agent loop achieved an 89% reduction in ethical violations and a 92% risk downgrade rate, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

Under non-IID data, these uniformly weighted updates can be strongly misaligned across clients, causing client drift and degrading the global model. Here we propose Fisher-Informed Parameterwise Aggregation (FIPA), a second-order aggregation method that replaces client-level scalar weights with parameter-specific Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) weights, enabling true parameter-level scaling that captures how each client's data uniquely influences different parameters. With low-rank approximation, FIPA remains communication- and computation-efficient. Across nonlinear function regression, PDE learning, and image classification, FIPA consistently improves over averaging-based aggregation, and can be effectively combined with state-of-the-art client-side optimization algorithms to further improve image classification accuracy. These results highlight the benefits of FIPA for federated learning under heterogeneous data distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIPA\ub294 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\ub418, \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubd80\uc5ec\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ubcc4 \ud53c\uc154 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud589\ub82c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c 2\ucc28 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 FIPA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud568.", "result": "FIPA\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud568\uc218 \ud68c\uadc0, PDE \ud559\uc2b5, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "conclusion": "FIPA\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, FedAvg\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 1\ucc28 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44 IID \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uac00\uc911\ub41c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04\uc5d0 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \ube44\ub3d9\uae30\ub418\uc5b4 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ubcc4 \ud53c\uc154 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud589\ub82c(FIM) \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 2\ucc28 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ud53c\uc154 \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ubcc4 \uc9d1\uacc4(FIPA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud558\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc800\ucc28 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud654\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 FIPA\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud568\uc218 \ud68c\uadc0, PDE \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c FIPA\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c FIPA\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing agent frameworks often suffer from architectural rigidity, vendor lock-in, and prohibitive complexity that impedes rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs and local inference engines, and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development.

Though analyzing and interpreting them contributes to significant values, e.g, disaster prediction and financial risk control, current workflows mainly rely on human data scientists, which requires significant labor costs and lacks automation. To tackle this, we introduce TimeART, a framework fusing the analytical capability of strong out-of-the-box tools and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which serves as a fully agentic data scientist for Time Series Question Answering (TSQA). To teach the LLM-based Time Series Reasoning Models (TSRMs) strategic tool-use, we also collect a 100k expert trajectory corpus called TimeToolBench. To enhance TSRMs' generalization capability, we then devise a four-stage training strategy, which boosts TSRMs through learning from their own early experiences and self-reflections. Experimentally, we train an 8B TSRM on TimeToolBench and equip it with the TimeART framework, and it achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on multiple TSQA tasks, which pioneers a novel approach towards agentic time series reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "TimeART\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84-\ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \ud574\uc11d\uc740 \uc7ac\ud574 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uae08\uc735 \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ucc3d\ucd9c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub9ce\uc740 \ub178\ub3d9 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "TimeART\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uac00\ub974\uce58\uae30 \uc704\ud574 10\ub9cc\uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uacbd\ub85c \uc9d1\ud569\uc778 TimeToolBench\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub124 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "8B TSRM\uc744 TimeToolBench\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0 TimeART \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uc7a5\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec TSQA \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\ucc99\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84-\ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc7ac\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uae08\uc735 \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac00\uc838\uc624\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc778\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub178\ub3d9 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5(TSQA)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc735\ud569\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 TimeART\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This version corresponds to the initial public release of the CUA architecture and associated evaluation metrics", "summary": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new forms of AI-assisted reasoning across scientific, technical, and organizational domains. However, prevailing modes of LLM use remain cognitively unstructured: problem framing, knowledge exploration, retrieval, methodological awareness, and explanation are typically collapsed into a single generative process. This cognitive collapse limits traceability, weakens epistemic control, and undermines reproducibility, particularly in high-responsibility settings.\n  We introduce Explicit Cognitive Allocation, a general principle for structuring AI-assisted inference through the explicit separation and orchestration of epistemic functions. We instantiate this principle in the Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA), an architecture that organizes inference into distinct stages of exploration and framing, epistemic anchoring, instrumental and methodological mapping, and interpretive synthesis. Central to this framework is the notion of Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs), which formalize heterogeneous means, including computational, experimental, organizational, regulatory, and educational instruments, through which abstract inquiries become investigable.\n  We evaluate the effects of explicit cognitive and instrumental allocation through controlled comparisons between CUA-orchestrated inference and baseline LLM inference under matched execution conditions. Across multiple prompts in the agricultural domain, CUA inference exhibits earlier and structurally governed epistemic convergence, higher epistemic alignment under semantic expansion, and systematic exposure of the instrumental landscape of inquiry. In contrast, baseline LLM inference shows greater variability in alignment and fails to explicitly surface instrumental structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758

A Comparative Study of GenAI vs Supervised ML for CRS Surgical Outcome Prediction", "comment": null, "summary": "Artificial intelligence has reshaped medical imaging, yet the use of AI on clinical data for prospective decision support remains limited. We study pre-operative prediction of clinically meaningful improvement in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), defining success as a more than 8.9-point reduction in SNOT-22 at 6 months (MCID). In a prospectively collected cohort where all patients underwent surgery, we ask whether models using only pre-operative clinical data could have identified those who would have poor outcomes, i.e. those who should have avoided surgery. We benchmark supervised ML (logistic regression, tree ensembles, and an in-house MLP) against generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), giving each the same structured inputs and constraining outputs to binary recommendations with confidence. Our best ML model (MLP) achieves 85 % accuracy with superior calibration and decision-curve net benefit. GenAI models underperform on discrimination and calibration across zero-shot setting. Notably, GenAI justifications align with clinician heuristics and the MLP's feature importance, repeatedly highlighting baseline SNOT-22, CT/endoscopy severity, polyp phenotype, and physchology/pain comorbidities. We provide a reproducible tabular-to-GenAI evaluation protocol and subgroup analyses. Findings support an ML-first, GenAI- augmented workflow: deploy calibrated ML for primary triage of surgical candidacy, with GenAI as an explainer to enhance transparency and shared decision-making.",

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization ability in emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes, context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation. Experimental results show that APOLO consistently improves diagnostic accuracy and robustness across domain-specific and stratified benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and generalizable paradigm for trustworthy LLM applications in mental healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "APOLO\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uac10\uc815\uc758 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ubc1c\uc0dd \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ub2e8\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uc815\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubd84\ub958, \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uae30 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uac1c\uc785\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "APOLO\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uae30\ud68d\uc790, \uad50\uc0ac, \ube44\ud3c9\uac00, \ud559\uc0dd, \ubaa9\ud45c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc APOLO\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubc0f \uacc4\uce35\ud654\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "APOLO\ub294 \uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\uc6b8\uc99d, \ubd88\uc548 \ubc0f \uc678\uc0c1\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uac10\uc815\uc758 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8, \uc0c1\ub2f4 \ub300\ud654 \ubc0f \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \ud37c\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac10\uc815\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubd84\ub958, \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uae30 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uac1c\uc785\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud669 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc740 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5bd\ud78c \uac10\uc815 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc778 \uac10\uc815 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ubc1c\uc0dd \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ub2e8\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(APOLO)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub354 \ub113\uace0 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

As autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for accurate and reliable ETA estimation has grown, playing a vital role in navigation, mobility planning, and traffic management. However, predicting ETA remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of traffic flow. Traditional methods often combine real-time and historical traffic data in simplistic ways, or rely on complex rule-based computations. While recent deep learning models have shown potential, they often require high computational costs and do not effectively capture the spatio-temporal patterns crucial for ETA prediction. ETA prediction inherently involves spatio-temporal causality, and our proposed model addresses this by leveraging attention mechanisms to extract and utilize temporal features accumulated at each spatio-temporal point along a route.

This dependence on manually designed workflows suffers from human biases and makes exploring the broader design space expensive. We introduce AgenticRed, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs' in-context learning to iteratively design and refine red-teaming systems without human intervention. Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench. Our approach exhibits strong transferability to proprietary models, achieving 100% ASR on GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o-mini, and 60% on Claude-Sonnet-3.5 (24% improvement).

Conventional strategies rank high in benchmarks due to their intrinsic capabilities to handle numerical inputs and careful modelling choices that balance exploration and Pareto-front exploitation, as well as handle multiple (conflicting) objectives. In this paper, we close this gap by leveraging LLMs as surrogate models and candidate samplers inside a structured hierarchical search strategy. By adaptively partitioning the input space into disjoint hyperrectangular regions and ranking them with a composite score function, we restrict the generative process of the LLM to specific, high-potential sub-spaces, hence making the problem easier to solve as the LLM doesn't have to reason about the global structure of the problem, but only locally instead. We show that under standard regularity assumptions, our algorithm generates candidate solutions that converge to the true Pareto set in Hausdorff distance. Empirically, it consistently outperforms the global LLM-based multi-objective optimizer and is on par with standard evolutionary and Bayesian optimization algorithm on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub7ec\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ub354\uc178\ud504 \uc120\ud0dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub7ec\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ube44\uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uac01\ud615 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ub9e4\uae41\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834\ud558\uba70, \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uace0 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \ubc0f \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub354\uc6b1 \uc27d\uac8c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub85c\uceec\ub85c\ub9cc \uc791\uc5c5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc989\uc2dc \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc544\ub2d9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc22b\uc790 \uc785\ub825 \ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uace0\uc720 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \uc804\uc120 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uc138\uc2ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ucc28\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub7ec\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc785\ub825 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ube44\uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc774\ud37c \uc9c1\uc0ac\uac01\ud615 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ub9e4\uae40\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 LLM\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud2b9\uc815 \uace0\uc7a0\uc7ac\uc131 \ud558\uc704 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub354 \uc27d\uac8c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud45c\uc900\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\uc131 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5d0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ud558\uc6b0\uc2a4\ub3c4\ub974\ud504 \uac70\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c4\uc9dc \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70 \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \ubc0f \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Although traditional methods relied mainly on classical deterministic and probabilistic approaches, recent progress has benefited from supervised deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve tract reconstruction. A persistent challenge in tractography is accurately reconstructing white matter tracts while minimizing spurious connections. To address this, we propose TractRLFusion, a novel GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple RL policies through a data-driven fusion strategy. Our method employs a two-stage training data selection process for effective policy fusion, followed by a multi-critic fine-tuning phase to enhance robustness and generalization.

Existing methods face challenges of inadequate reasoning ability, deficient multi-turn dialogue capability, and narrow generalization. To this end, we 1) propose a multi-agent-based TS Evolution algorithm named TSEvol. On top of it, we 2) introduce the AD reasoning and multi-turn dialogue Dataset TSEData-20K and contribute the Chatbot family for AD, including ChatAD-Llama3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Mistral-7B. Furthermore, 3) we propose the TS Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (TKTO) to enhance ChatAD's cross-task generalization capability. Lastly, 4) we propose a LLM-driven Learning-based AD Benchmark LLADBench to evaluate the performance of ChatAD and nine baselines across seven datasets and tasks. Our three ChatAD models achieve substantial gains, up to 34.50% in accuracy, 34.71% in F1, and a 37.42% reduction in false positives.

Although this paradigm is promising for utilizing unlabeled data, static or random augmentation strategies often fail to preserve intrinsic information due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals where statistical properties change over time. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10\\%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69\\% and 8.80\\% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Notably, this agent mainly chose optimal strategies for each task -- for example, Time Masking with a 62\\% probability for sleep stage classification and Crop \\& Resize with a 77\\% probability for seizure detection. Our framework suggests its potential to replace conventional heuristic-based augmentations and establish a new autonomous paradigm for data augmentation.

Text data collected from social media and dating applications may provide new opportunities for personalized public health interventions by enabling automatic identification of risk and protective behaviors. In this study, we evaluated whether text from social media and dating apps can be used to predict sexual risk behaviors, alcohol use, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among MSM. With participant consent, we collected textual data and trained machine learning models using features derived from ChatGPT embeddings, BERT embeddings, LIWC, and a dictionary-based risk term approach. The models achieved strong performance in predicting monthly binge drinking and having more than five sexual partners, with F1 scores of 0.78, and moderate performance in predicting PrEP use and heavy drinking, with F1 scores of 0.64 and 0.63. These findings demonstrate that social media and dating app text data can provide valuable insights into risk and protective behaviors and highlight the potential of large language model-based methods to support scalable and personalized public health interventions for MSM.", "AI": {"tldr": "MSM\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud305 \uc571\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc74c\uc8fc, PrEP \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MSM\uc740 \uc774\uc131\uc560 \ub0a8\uc131\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc131\ubcd1\uacfc \uc720\ud574 \uc74c\uc8fc\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ub192\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc704\ud5d8\uacfc \ubcf4\ud638 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uacf5\uacf5 \uac74\uac15 \uac1c\uc785\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucc38\uc5ec\uc790\uc758 \ub3d9\uc758 \ud558\uc5d0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ChatGPT \uc784\ubca0\ub529, BERT \uc784\ubca0\ub529, LIWC \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc804 \uae30\ubc18 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc6a9\uc5b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc6d4\uac04 \ud3ed\uc74c \uc74c\uc8fc\uc640 5\uba85 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294\ub370 F1 \uc810\uc218 0.78\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, PrEP \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uacfc\uc74c \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 F1 \uc810\uc218 0.64\uc640 0.63\ub85c \uc911\uac04 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud305 \uc571 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubc0f \ubcf4\ud638 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, MSM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub0a8\uc131\uacfc \uc131\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \ub0a8\uc131(MSM)\uc740 \uc774\uc131\uc560 \ub0a8\uc131\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc131\uc804\ud30c \uac10\uc5fc\uacfc \uc720\ud574 \uc74c\uc8fc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud305 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubc0f \ubcf4\ud638 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uacf5\uacf5 \uac74\uac15 \uac1c\uc785\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud305 \uc571\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MSM\uc758 \uc131\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud589\ub3d9, \uc54c\ucf54\uc62c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ub178\ucd9c \uc804 \uc608\ubc29(PREP) \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790\uc758 \ub3d9\uc758\ub97c \ubc1b\uc544 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 ChatGPT \uc784\ubca0\ub529, BERT \uc784\ubca0\ub529, LIWC \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc804 \uae30\ubc18 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc6a9\uc5b4 \uc811\uadfc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc6d4\uac04 \ud3ed\uc74c \uc74c\uc8fc \ubc0f 5\uba85 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac01\uac01 F1 \uc810\uc218 0.78\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, PrEP \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uacfc\uc74c \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 F1 \uc810\uc218 0.64 \ubc0f 0.63\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud305 \uc571 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubc0f \ubcf4\ud638 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 MSM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Current learning-based methods are non-evolvable with problems of low-level compression modeling, limited adaptability, and user-unfriendly interface. To this end, we propose AgentGC, the first evolutionary Agent-based GD Compressor, consisting of 3 layers with multi-agent named Leader and Worker. Specifically, the 1) User layer provides a user-friendly interface via Leader combined with LLM; 2) Cognitive layer, driven by the Leader, integrates LLM to consider joint optimization of algorithm-dataset-system, addressing the issues of low-level modeling and limited adaptability; and 3) Compression layer, headed by Worker, performs compression & decompression via a automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression framework. On top of AgentGC, we design 3 modes to support diverse scenarios: CP for compression-ratio priority, TP for throughput priority, and BM for balanced mode. Compared with 14 baselines on 9 datasets, the average compression ratios gains are 16.66%, 16.11%, and 16.33%, the throughput gains are 4.73x, 9.23x, and 9.15x, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentGC\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac8c\ub188 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc555\ucd95\uae30\ub85c, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc778 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998-\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b-\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc5c6\uace0, \uc800\uc218\uc900 \uc555\ucd95 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc801\uc751\uc131, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentGC\ub294 3\uac1c\uc758 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uba70, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4: \ub9ac\ub354\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uc9c0 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uc6cc\ucee4\ub294 \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "14\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 9\uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ud3c9\uade0 \uc555\ucd95 \ube44\uc728\uc740 16.66%, 16.11%, 16.33%\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc740 \uac01\uac01 4.73\ubc30, 9.23\ubc30, 9.15\ubc30 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AgentGC\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 3\uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc555\ucd95 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc190\uc2e4 \uc555\ucd95\uc740 \uac8c\ub188 \ub370\uc774\ud130(GD) \uc800\uc7a5, \uacf5\uc720 \ubc0f \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uc9c4\ud654\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \uc555\ucd95 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc801\uc751\uc131, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574, 3\uac1c\uc758 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 GD \uc555\ucd95\uae30\uc778 AgentGC\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, 1) \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub294 LLM\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \ub9ac\ub354\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc778 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0; 2) \uc778\uc9c0 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub294 \ub9ac\ub354\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998-\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b-\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc801\uc751\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4; 3) \uc555\ucd95 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub294 \uc6cc\ucee4\uac00 \uc8fc\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc555\ucd95 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.

Sidiropoulos"], "title": "Penalizing Localized Dirichlet Energies in Low Rank Tensor Products", "comment": "19 pages", "summary": "We study low-rank tensor-product B-spline (TPBS) models for regression tasks and investigate Dirichlet energy as a measure of smoothness. We show that TPBS models admit a closed-form expression for the Dirichlet energy, and reveal scenarios where perfect interpolation is possible with exponentially small Dirichlet energy. This renders global Dirichlet energy-based regularization ineffective. To address this limitation, we propose a novel regularization strategy based on local Dirichlet energies defined on small hypercubes centered at the training points. Leveraging pretrained TPBS models, we also introduce two estimators for inference from incomplete samples. Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise. Overall, TPBS models exhibit greater robustness to overfitting and consistently benefit from regularization, while neural networks are more sensitive to overfitting and less effective in leveraging regularization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc800\ud76c\ub294 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc800\uacc4\uc218 \ud150\uc11c\uacf1 B-\uc2a4\ud50c\ub77c\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378(TPBS \ubaa8\ub378)\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0\uc758 \ucc99\ub3c4\ub85c\uc11c \ub514\ub9ac\ud074\ub808 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc800\uacc4\uc218 \ud150\uc11c\uacf1 B-\uc2a4\ud50c\ub77c\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud6c8\ub828 \uc9c0\uc810 \uc8fc\uc704\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud050\ube0c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uad6d\uc18c \ub514\ub9ac\ud074\ub808 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "TPBS \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub204\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc800\uacc4\uc218 \ud150\uc11c\uacf1 B-\uc2a4\ud50c\ub77c\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \ub0b4\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub354 \uc798 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc800\uacc4\uc218 \ud150\uc11c\uacf1 B-\uc2a4\ud50c\ub77c\uc778(TPBS) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0\uc758 \ucc99\ub3c4\ub85c\uc11c \ub514\ub9ac\ud074\ub808 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TPBS \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub514\ub9ac\ud074\ub808 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2eb\ud78c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ub514\ub9ac\ud074\ub808 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uac00 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc744 \ub54c \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ubcf4\uac04\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc804\uc5ed \ub514\ub9ac\ud074\ub808 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uac00 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc791\uc740 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud050\ube0c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uad6d\uc18c \ub514\ub9ac\ud074\ub808 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c TPBS \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub3c4 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uacfc\uc758 \ube44\uad50 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 TPBS \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uadf8 \uc678\uc5d0 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c TPBS \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub354 \ud070 \ub0b4\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc5d0 \ub354 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uace0 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub35c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Unlike conventional speech emotion recognition studies that focus primarily on classification accuracy, our approach emphasizes the transformation of inferred emotional states into safe, age-appropriate, and controllable response content through a structured pipeline of specialized AI agents. The proposed system comprises four cooperative agents: (1) an Emotion Recognition Agent with CNN-based acoustic feature extraction, (2) a Response Policy Decision Agent for mapping emotions to response modes, (3) a Content Parameter Generation Agent for producing media control parameters, and (4) a Safety Verification Agent enforcing age-appropriateness and stimulation constraints. We introduce an explicit safety verification loop that filters generated content before output, ensuring compliance with predefined rules. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the system achieves 73.2% emotion recognition accuracy, 89.4% response mode consistency, and 100% safety compliance while maintaining sub-100ms inference latency suitable for on-device deployment. The modular architecture enables interpretability and extensibility, making it applicable to child-adjacent media, therapeutic applications, and emotionally responsive smart devices.", "AI": {"tldr":

In this work, we propose an interpretable decision support framework. Our system integrates four core components: (1) a clustering-based stratification module that categorizes patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups upon ICU admission, using clustering with statistical validation; (2) a synthetic data augmentation pipeline leveraging variational autoencoders (VAE) and diffusion models to enrich underrepresented trajectories such as fluid or vasopressor administration; (3) an offline reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained using Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR) with a lightweight attention encoder and supported by an ensemble models for conservative, safety-aware treatment recommendations; and (4) a rationale generation module powered by a multi-modal large language model (LLM), which produces natural-language justifications grounded in clinical context and retrieved expert knowledge. Evaluated on the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets, our approach achieves high treatment accuracy while providing clinicians with interpretable and robust policy recommendations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc911\ud658\uc790\uc2e4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud328\ud608\uc99d \uce58\ub8cc\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud328\ud608\uc99d\uc740 \uc911\ud658\uc790\uc2e4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc0ac\ub9dd \uc6d0\uc778 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc774\uba70, \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uce58\ub8cc \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \ud658\uc790 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 (1) \ud1b5\uacc4 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \uc800\uc704\ud5d8, \uc911\uc704\ud5d8 \ubc0f \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uce35\ud654 \ubaa8\ub4c8, (2) \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(VAE) \ubc0f \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ub41c \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778, (3) \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 Advantage Weighted Regression(AWR)\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, (4) \uc784\uc0c1 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "MIMIC-III \ubc0f eICU \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uce58\ub8cc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1\uc758\uc5d0\uac8c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uc81c\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc911\ud658\uc790\uc2e4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud328\ud608\uc99d \uce58\ub8cc\uc758 \uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud328\ud608\uc99d\uc740 \uc911\ud658\uc790\uc2e4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc0ac\ub9dd \uc6d0\uc778 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc774\uba70, \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uce58\ub8cc \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \ud658\uc790 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 (1) \ud1b5\uacc4 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \uc800\uc704\ud5d8, \uc911\uc704\ud5d8 \ubc0f \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uce35\ud654 \ubaa8\ub4c8, (2) \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(VAE) \ubc0f \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ub41c \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778, (3) \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 Advantage Weighted Regression(AWR)\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, (4) \uc784\uc0c1 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4.

However, the open-ended nature of real-world data science problems, which often span multiple taxonomies and lack standard answers, poses a significant challenge for evaluation. To address this, we introduce DSAEval, a benchmark comprising 641 real-world data science problems grounded in 285 diverse datasets, covering both structured and unstructured data (e.g., vision and text). DSAEval incorporates three distinctive features: (1) Multimodal Environment Perception, which enables agents to interpret observations from multiple modalities including text and vision; (2) Multi-Query Interactions, which mirror the iterative and cumulative nature of real-world data science projects; and (3) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation, which provides a holistic assessment across reasoning, code, and results. We systematically evaluate 11 advanced agentic LLMs using DSAEval. Our results show that Claude-Sonnet-4.5 achieves the strongest overall performance, GPT-5.2 is the most efficient, and MiMo-V2-Flash is the most cost-effective. We further demonstrate that multimodal perception consistently improves performance on vision-related tasks, with gains ranging from 2.04% to 11.30%. Overall, while current data science agents perform well on structured data and routine data anlysis workflows, substantial challenges remain in unstructured domains.

We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors.

Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research. Our findings underscore both the sophistication and risks of LLM deception in social contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc18d\uc784\uc218 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c \ub17c\ubb38.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc18d\uc784\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 35\uac1c\uc758 Mafia \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0, \uac8c\uc784 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GPT-4-Turbo\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Mafia \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Mafia \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uc758 \uc18d\uc784\uc218 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 LLM \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \uac8c\uc784\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\uc558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc774 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc18d\uc784\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, LLM\uc758 \uc18d\uc784\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc18d\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc18d\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud654 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0c0\uc778\uc744 \uc18d\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc131\uacf5\uc758 \uc5f4\uc1e0\uc778 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ucd94\ub9ac \uac8c\uc784(Social Deduction Game, SDG) Mafia\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc18d\uc784\uc218\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 SDG \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GPT-4o LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 35\uac1c\uc758 Mafia \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ud6c4, \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc5ed\ud560 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uac8c\uc784 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 Mafia \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GPT-4-Turbo\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Mafia \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc18d\uc784\uc218 \ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac \ub9c8\ucee4\ub85c \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 28\uac1c\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \ub79c\ub364 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 Mafia \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uc758 \ub9c8\ud53c\uc544 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 LLM \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \uac8c\uc784\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc77c\uc218\uc640 \uac10\uc9c0\ub41c \ub9c8\ud53c\uc544 \uc218\uc640 \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ub354 \uc798 \uc11e\uc5ec \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc18d\uc784\uc218\ub97c \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc4f4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM Mafia \uae30\ub85d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uacf5\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc18d\uc784\uc218\uc758 \uc815\uad50\ud568\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "Q-learning with Adjoint Matching (QAM) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \ub610\ub294 \ud750\ub984 \uc815\ud569 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "QAM\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud68c\uadc0 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc778 \uc778\uc811 \uc815\ud569(adjont matching)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "QAM\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "QAM\uc740 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uc5ed\uc804\ud30c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube44\ud3b8\ud5a5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c Q-\ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \ub610\ub294 \ud750\ub984 \uc815\ud569 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 TD \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 \uc778\uc811 \uc815\ud569\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 Q-\ud559\uc2b5(QAM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc77c\ucc28 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc7a1\uc74c \uc81c\uac70 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uce58\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud750\ub984 \ub610\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uac00\uce58\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uadfc\uc0ac\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud55c\ub2e4.

However, the capabilities of current LLMs in this setting remain unclear due to the lack of systematic benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce LifeAgentBench, a large-scale QA benchmark for long-horizon, cross-dimensional, and multi-user lifestyle health reasoning, containing 22,573 questions spanning from basic retrieval to complex reasoning. We release an extensible benchmark construction pipeline and a standardized evaluation protocol to enable reliable and scalable assessment of LLM-based health assistants. We then systematically evaluate 11 leading LLMs on LifeAgentBench and identify key bottlenecks in long-horizon aggregation and cross-dimensional reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we propose LifeAgent as a strong baseline agent for health assistant that integrates multi-step evidence retrieval with deterministic aggregation, achieving significant improvements compared with two widely used baselines. Case studies further demonstrate its potential in realistic daily-life scenarios.

We introduce \\textit{FireCastRL}, a proactive artificial intelligence (AI) framework that combines wildfire forecasting with intelligent suppression strategies. Our framework first uses a deep spatiotemporal model to predict wildfire ignition. For high-risk predictions, we deploy a pre-trained reinforcement learning (RL) agent to execute real-time suppression tactics with helitack units inside a physics-informed 3D simulation. The framework generates a threat assessment report to help emergency responders optimize resource allocation and planning. In addition, we are publicly releasing a large-scale, spatiotemporal dataset containing $\\mathbf{9.5}$ million samples of environmental variables for wildfire prediction.

Clifton", "Luciano Del Corro", "Marinka Zitnik"], "title": "Autonomous Knowledge Graph Exploration with Adaptive Breadth-Depth Retrieval", "comment": null, "summary": "Retrieving evidence for language model queries from knowledge graphs requires balancing broad search across the graph with multi-hop traversal to follow relational links. Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARK\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub9ac\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc84\ub85c, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Breadth-Depth \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc804\uc5ed\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uad00\uacc4 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \ub530\ub77c\uac00\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 \uc774\ub3d9 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd9c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ARK\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc5b4\ud718 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \uc77c\ud68c\uc131 \uc774\uc6c3 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\ub3d9 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 KG \ub9ac\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc84\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "STaRK\uc5d0\uc11c ARK\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 Hit@1\uc774 59.1%\uc774\uace0 \ud3c9\uade0 MRR\uc774 67.4\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uba70, \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd \ud504\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 Hit@1\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 31.4% \ubc0f \ud3c9\uade0 MRR\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 28.0% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ARK\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uad50\uc0ac\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc29\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 8B \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc99d\ub958\ud558\uc600\uace0, AMAZON, MAG, PRIME \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 \uae30\ubcf8 8B \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 Hit@1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c +7.0, +26.6, +13.5\ub9cc\ud07c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uad50\uc0ac\uc758 Hit@1 \ube44\uc728\uc758 \ucd5c\ub300 98.5%\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc804\uccb4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \uad00\uacc4 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \ub530\ub974\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 \uc774\ub3d9 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \ub9ac\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc84\ub294 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae4a\uc774\uac00 \uc595\uace0, \ubc18\uba74 \uc774\ub3d9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud560 \uc2dc\ub4dc \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uccb4 \ubc0f \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \ub54c \uc2e4\ud328\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing approaches often rely on task-specific pipelines and trained formal provers, limiting their flexibility and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the paradigm that directly uses a general coding agent as a formal math reasoner. This paradigm is motivated by (1) A general coding agent provides a natural interface for diverse reasoning tasks beyond proving, (2) Performance can be improved by simply replacing the underlying base model, without training, and (3) MCP enables flexible extension and autonomous calling of specialized tools, avoiding complex design. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Numina-Lean-Agent, which combines Claude Code with Numina-Lean-MCP to enable autonomous interaction with Lean, retrieval of relevant theorems, informal proving and auxiliary reasoning tools. Using Claude Opus 4.5 as the base model, Numina-Lean-Agent solves all problems in Putnam 2025 (12 / 12), matching the best closed-source system. Beyond benchmark evaluation, we further demonstrate its generality by interacting with mathematicians to successfully formalize the Brascamp-Lieb theorem.

From subcellular chemical networks to swarms of organisms, and across evolved, engineered, and chimeric systems, it is hypothesized that scale-invariant principles of decision-making can be discovered. We propose that cognition in both natural and synthetic systems can be characterized and understood by the interplay between two equally important invariants: (1) the remapping of embedding spaces, and (2) the navigation within these spaces. Biological collectives, from single cells to entire organisms (and beyond), remap transcriptional, morphological, physiological, or 3D spaces to maintain homeostasis and regenerate structure, while navigating these spaces through distributed error correction. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata enact analogous processes by remapping data into latent embeddings and refining them iteratively through contextualization. We argue that this dual principle - remapping and navigation of embedding spaces via iterative error minimization - constitutes a substrate-independent invariant of cognition.

Current solutions typically treat this as a direct-to-text generation problem, suffering from hallucination, overlooked critiques, and a lack of verifiable grounding. To address these limitations, we introduce $\\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$, the first multi-agents framework that reframes rebuttal generation as an evidence-centric planning task. Our system decomposes complex feedback into atomic concerns and dynamically constructs hybrid contexts by synthesizing compressed summaries with high-fidelity text while integrating an autonomous and on-demand external search module to resolve concerns requiring outside literature. By generating an inspectable response plan before drafting, $\\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$ ensures that every argument is explicitly anchored in internal or external evidence. We validate our approach on the proposed $\\textbf{RebuttalBench}$ and demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms strong baselines in coverage, faithfulness, and strategic coherence, offering a transparent and controllable assistant for the peer review process.

While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies.
