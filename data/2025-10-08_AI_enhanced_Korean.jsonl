Plaintiff and defendant agents choose from a constrained action\nspace (for example, discovery requests, motions, meet-and-confer, sanctions)\ngoverned by a JSON rules engine, while a stochastic judge model with calibrated\ngrant rates, cost allocations, and sanction tendencies resolves outcomes. We\ncompare four policies: PPO, a contextual bandit with an LLM, a direct LLM\npolicy, and a hand-crafted heuristic; Instead of optimizing binary case\noutcomes, agents are trained and evaluated using effective win rate and a\ncomposite exploit score that combines opponent-cost inflation, calendar\npressure, settlement pressure at low merit, and a rule-compliance margin.\nAcross configurable regimes (e.g., bankruptcy stays, inter partes review, tax\nprocedures) and heterogeneous judges, we observe emergent ``exploit chains'',\nsuch as cost-inflating discovery sequences and calendar-pressure tactics that\nremain procedurally valid yet systemically harmful. Evaluation via cross-play\nand Bradley-Terry ratings shows, PPO wins more often, the bandit is the most\nconsistently competitive across opponents, the LLM trails them, and the\nheuristic is weakest. The results are stable in judge settings, and the\nsimulation reveals emergent exploit chains, motivating red-teaming of legal\nrule systems in addition to model-level testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "LegalSim\uc740 \ubc95\uc801 \uc808\ucc28\uc758 \uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubc95\uc801 \uaddc\uce59\uc758 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2b9\ub960\uacfc \ud569\uc131 \ucc29\ucde8 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PPO\uac00 \ub354 \uc790\uc8fc \uc2b9\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \ubc34\ub527\uc774 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LegalSim\uc740 \ubc95\uc801 \uaddc\uce59 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub808\ub4dc\ud300 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc545\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubc95\uc801 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc778 LegalSim\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6d0\uace0 \ubc0f \ud53c\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 JSON \uaddc\uce59 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub418\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04(\uc608: \ubc1c\uacac \uc694\uccad, \ub3d9\uc758 \uc694\uccad, \uc81c\uc7ac \ub4f1)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uba70, \uad50\uc815\ub41c \ubd80\uc5ec \ube44\uc728, \ube44\uc6a9 \ubc30\ubd84 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc7ac \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud310\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 PPO, LLM\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ubc34\ub527, \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 LLM \uc815\ucc45 \ubc0f \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc791\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\uc9c4 \uc0ac\uac74 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2b9\ub960\uacfc \uc0c1\ub300 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc778\ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc158, \uce98\ub9b0\ub354 \uc555\ubc15, \ub0ae\uc740 \uc790\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud569\uc758 \uc555\ub825, \uaddc\uce59 \uc900\uc218 \uc5ec\uc720\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ucc29\ucde8 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uccb4\uc81c(\uc608: \ud30c\uc0b0 \uc911\uc9c0, \uc0c1\ud638 \uc2ec\uc0ac, \uc138\uae08 \uc808\ucc28)\uc640 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud310\uc0ac\ub4e4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc801\uc778 '\ucc29\ucde8 \uccb4\uc778'\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uc2dc\uc800\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc778\ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc1c\uacac \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uce98\ub9b0\ub354 \uc555\ubc15 \uc804\uc220\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad50\ucc28 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc0f \ube0c\ub798\ub4e4\ub9ac-\ud14c\ub9ac \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 PPO\uac00 \ub354 \uc790\uc8fc \uc2b9\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \ubc34\ub527\uc774 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc790\ub4e4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uacbd\uc7c1\ud558\uba70, LLM\uc774 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ub4a4\ucc98\uc9c0\uba70, \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud310\uc0ac \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc774 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc801\uc778 \ucc29\ucde8 \uccb4\uc778\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc5b4 \ubc95\uc801 \uaddc\uce59 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The existing energy management systems often prioritize\nsystem efficiency (balanced energy demand and supply) at the expense of user\ncomfort. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel decentralized\nmulti-agent coordination-based demand-side management system. The proposed\nsystem enables individual agents to coordinate for demand-side energy\noptimization while improving the user comfort and maintaining the system\nefficiency. A key innovation of this work is the introduction of a slot\nexchange mechanism, where agents first receive optimized appliance-level energy\nconsumption schedules and then coordinate with each other to adjust these\nschedules through slot exchanges. This approach improves user comfort even when\nagents show non-altruistic behaviour, and it scales well with large\npopulations. The system also promotes fairness by balancing satisfaction levels\nacross users. For performance evaluation, a real-world dataset is used, and the\nresults demonstrate that the proposed slot exchange mechanism increases user\ncomfort and fairness without raising system inefficiency cost, making it a\npractical and scalable solution for future smart grids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc804\ub825 \uc218\uc694 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uae30\uae30 \uc0ac\uc6a9

Existing\naudits are dominated by heuristics that lack theoretical guarantees, struggle\nto transfer across tasks, and seldom ship with the infrastructure needed for\nindependent replication. We introduce \\emph{Audit the Whisper}, a\nconference-grade research artifact that spans theory, benchmark design,\ndetection, and reproducibility. Our contributions are: (i) a channel-capacity\nanalysis showing how interventions such as paraphrase, rate limiting, and role\npermutation impose quantifiable capacity penalties -- operationalized via\npaired-run Kullback--Leibler diagnostics -- that tighten mutual-information\nthresholds with finite-sample guarantees; (ii) \\textsc{ColludeBench}-v0,\ncovering pricing, first-price auctions, and peer review with configurable\ncovert schemes, deterministic manifests, and reward instrumentation; and (iii)\na calibrated auditing pipeline that fuses cross-run mutual information,\npermutation invariance, watermark variance, and fairness-aware acceptance bias,\neach tuned to a \\(10^{-3}\\) false-positive budget. Across 600 audited runs\nspanning 12 intervention conditions, the union meta-test attains TPR~$=1$ with\nzero observed false alarms, while ablations surface the price-of-auditing\ntrade-off and highlight fairness-driven colluders invisible to MI alone.

Concurrently, existing multimodal\napproaches have not fully exploited the power of large vision models (LVMs) to\ninterpret spatiotemporal data. Additionally, there remains significant\nunexplored potential in leveraging the advantages of information extraction\nfrom different modalities to enhance time series forecasting performance. To\naddress these gaps, we propose the VIFO, a cross-modal forecasting model.

Automated\ncontradiction mining is combined with human-in-the-loop validation to ensure\nhigh accuracy. Our contributions include generating realistic enterprise\ndocuments, modeling a taxonomy of contradiction types common in business\nprocesses, enabling controlled creation of self- and pairwise contradictions,\ndeveloping a contradiction-aware retrieval evaluation pipeline and embedding\nhuman oversight to reflect domain-specific judgment complexity.

Existing Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) methods for scalar\ndata suffer from low embedding capacity and poor intrinsic mixing between host\ndata and watermark. This paper introduces Hiding in the Imaginary Domain with\nData Encryption (H[i]dden), a novel framework based on complex number\narithmetic for simultaneous information embedding and encryption.

Aligning these agents via\npreference-based offline methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a\npromising direction, yet it faces a critical granularity mismatch.\nTrajectory-level DPO provides a signal that is too coarse for precise credit\nassignment, while step-level DPO is often too myopic to capture the value of\nmulti-step behaviors. To resolve this challenge, we introduce Hierarchical\nPreference Learning (HPL), a hierarchical framework that optimizes LLM agents\nby leveraging preference signals at multiple, synergistic granularities. While\nHPL incorporates trajectory- and step-level DPO for global and local policy\nstability, its core innovation lies in group-level preference optimization\nguided by a dual-layer curriculum. Our approach first decomposes expert\ntrajectories into semantically coherent action groups and then generates\ncontrasting suboptimal groups to enable preference learning at a fine-grained,\nsub-task level. Then, instead of treating all preference pairs equally, HPL\nintroduces a curriculum scheduler that organizes the learning process from\nsimple to complex. This curriculum is structured along two axes: the group\nlength, representing sub-task complexity, and the sample difficulty, defined by\nthe reward gap between preferred and dispreferred action groups. Experiments on\nthree challenging agent benchmarks show that HPL outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Due to the extensive observation space\narising from the large number of drivers and orders, order dispatching, though\nfundamentally a centralized task, is often addressed using Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL). However, independent MARL methods fail to\ncapture global information and exhibit poor cooperation among workers, while\nCentralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL methods suffer from\nthe curse of dimensionality. To overcome these challenges, we propose\nTriple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method\ndesigned specifically for large-scale order dispatching on ride-sharing\nplatforms. Built on a variant TD3, our approach addresses the vast action space\nthrough an action decomposition strategy that breaks down the joint action\nprobability into individual driver action probabilities. To handle the\nextensive observation space, we introduce a novel BERT-based network, where\nparameter reuse mitigates parameter growth as the number of drivers and orders\nincreases, and the attention mechanism effectively captures the complex\nrelationships among the large pool of driver and orders. We validate our method\nusing a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Manhattan. Triple-BERT achieves\napproximately an 11.95% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, with\na 4.26% increase in served orders and a 22.25% reduction in pickup times.

A\ncritical step in this process is tool selection, where a retriever first\nsurfaces candidate tools from a larger pool, after which the LLM selects the\nmost appropriate one. This pipeline presents an underexplored attack surface\nwhere errors in selection can lead to severe outcomes like unauthorized data\naccess or denial of service, all without modifying the agent's model or code.\nWhile existing evaluations measure task performance in benign settings, they\noverlook the specific vulnerabilities of the tool selection mechanism under\nadversarial conditions. To address this gap, we introduce ToolCert, the first\nstatistical framework that formally certifies tool selection robustness.\nToolCert models tool selection as a Bernoulli success process and evaluates it\nagainst a strong, adaptive attacker who introduces adversarial tools with\nmisleading metadata, and are iteratively refined based on the agent's previous\nchoices. By sampling these adversarial interactions, ToolCert produces a\nhigh-confidence lower bound on accuracy, formally quantifying the agent's\nworst-case performance. Our evaluation with ToolCert uncovers the severe\nfragility: under attacks injecting deceptive tools or saturating retrieval, the\ncertified accuracy bound drops near zero, an average performance drop of over\n60% compared to non-adversarial settings.

Maguire Jr.", "Dejan Kostic"], "title": "KVComm: Enabling Efficient LLM Communication through Selective KV Sharing", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent\nsystems, where effective inter-model communication is crucial. Existing\ncommunication protocols either rely on natural language, incurring high\ninference costs and information loss, or on hidden states, which suffer from\ninformation concentration bias and inefficiency. To address these limitations,\nwe propose KVComm, a novel communication framework that enables efficient\ncommunication between LLMs through selective sharing of KV pairs. KVComm\nleverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the\npitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy\nbased on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most\ninformative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse\ntasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance\nto the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without\nany communication, while transmitting as few as 30\\% of layers' KV pairs. Our\nstudy highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM\ncommunication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 KVComm\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uac04 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc778 KV \uc30d \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 KVComm \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\uc758 \uc911\uc694 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c KV \uacc4\uce35 \uc120\ud0dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785.", "result": "KVComm\uc740 30%\uc758 KV \uc30d\ub9cc \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ubcd1\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568.", "conclusion": "KV \uc30d\uc774 LLM \uac04 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub9e4\uccb4\uac00 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc9d1\uc911 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uacfc \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 KV \uc30d\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 KVComm\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Forensics & Security", "summary": "Multimodal agents built on large vision-language models (LVLMs) are\nincreasingly deployed in open-world settings but remain highly vulnerable to\nprompt injection, especially through visual inputs. We introduce AgentTypo, a\nblack-box red-teaming framework that mounts adaptive typographic prompt\ninjection by embedding optimized text into webpage images. Our automatic\ntypographic prompt injection (ATPI) algorithm maximizes prompt reconstruction\nby substituting captioners while minimizing human detectability via a stealth\nloss, with a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator guiding black-box optimization\nover text placement, size, and color. To further enhance attack strength, we\ndevelop AgentTypo-pro, a multi-LLM system that iteratively refines injection\nprompts using evaluation feedback and retrieves successful past examples for\ncontinual learning. Effective prompts are abstracted into generalizable\nstrategies and stored in a strategy repository, enabling progressive knowledge\naccumulation and reuse in future attacks. Experiments on the VWA-Adv benchmark\nacross Classifieds, Shopping, and Reddit scenarios show that AgentTypo\nsignificantly outperforms the latest image-based attacks such as AgentAttack.\nOn GPT-4o agents, our image-only attack raises the success rate from 0.23 to\n0.45, with consistent results across GPT-4V, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and\nClaude 3 Opus. In image+text settings, AgentTypo achieves 0.68 ASR, also\noutperforming the latest baselines. Our findings reveal that AgentTypo poses a\npractical and potent threat to multimodal agents and highlight the urgent need\nfor effective defense.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentTypo\ub294

However,\nlittle work has examined whether these trajectories comply with such policies,\nor whether policy violations persist across different contexts such as domains\n(e.g., shopping or coding websites) and subdomains (e.g., product search and\norder management in shopping). To address this gap, we introduce\nPolicyGuardBench, a benchmark of about 60k examples for detecting policy\nviolations in agent trajectories. From diverse agent runs, we generate a broad\nset of policies and create both within subdomain and cross subdomain pairings\nwith violation labels. In addition to full-trajectory evaluation,\nPolicyGuardBench also includes a prefix-based violation detection task where\nmodels must anticipate policy violations from truncated trajectory prefixes\nrather than complete sequences. Using this dataset, we train PolicyGuard-4B, a\nlightweight guardrail model that delivers strong detection accuracy across all\ntasks while keeping inference efficient. Notably, PolicyGuard-4B generalizes\nacross domains and preserves high accuracy on unseen settings.

While analyzing the\ndecision boundary of large language models (LLMs) has raised increasing\nattention recently, constructing it for mainstream LLMs remains computationally\ninfeasible due to the enormous vocabulary-sequence sizes and the\nauto-regressive nature of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper we propose\nDecision Potential Surface (DPS), a new notion for analyzing LLM decision\nboundary. DPS is defined on the confidences in distinguishing different\nsampling sequences for each input, which naturally captures the potential of\ndecision boundary. We prove that the zero-height isohypse in DPS is equivalent\nto the decision boundary of an LLM, with enclosed regions representing decision\nregions. By leveraging DPS, for the first time in the literature, we propose an\napproximate decision boundary construction algorithm, namely $K$-DPS, which\nonly requires K-finite times of sequence sampling to approximate an LLM's\ndecision boundary with negligible error. We theoretically derive the upper\nbounds for the absolute error, expected error, and the error concentration\nbetween K-DPS and the ideal DPS, demonstrating that such errors can be\ntrade-off with sampling times.

However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited\ngeneralization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In\nthis study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor\ndefense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels\ninto a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned\ndataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to\nassociate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding\nthe effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and\ngeneralizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings\nand attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can\nneutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct\nextensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary\ngeneration tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results\ndemonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success\nrate compared with baseline models.

Recent studies reveal that\nthese agents are vulnerable against attackers who can bias selection outcomes\nthrough preference manipulations using adversarial pop-ups, image\nperturbations, or content tweaks. Existing work, however, either assumes strong\nwhite-box access, with limited single-modal perturbations, or uses impractical\nsettings. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that joint\nexploitation of visual and textual channels yields significantly more powerful\npreference manipulations under realistic attacker capabilities. We introduce\nCross-Modal Preference Steering (CPS) that jointly optimizes imperceptible\nmodifications to an item's visual and natural language descriptions, exploiting\nCLIP-transferable image perturbations and RLHF-induced linguistic biases to\nsteer agent decisions. In contrast to prior studies that assume gradient\naccess, or control over webpages, or agent memory, we adopt a realistic\nblack-box threat setup: a non-privileged adversary can edit only their own\nlisting's images and textual metadata, with no insight into the agent's model\ninternals. We evaluate CPS on agents powered by state-of-the-art proprietary\nand open source VLMs including GPT-4.1, Qwen-2.5VL and Pixtral-Large on both\nmovie selection and e-commerce tasks. Our results show that CPS is\nsignificantly more effective than leading baseline methods. For instance, our\nresults show that CPS consistently outperforms baselines across all models\nwhile maintaining 70% lower detection rates, demonstrating both effectiveness\nand stealth. These findings highlight an urgent need for robust defenses as\nagentic systems play an increasingly consequential role in society.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

This paper explores the introduction of\nquadratic transformations to further increase nonlinearity in neural networks,\nwith the aim of enhancing the performance of existing architectures. To reduce\nparameter complexity and computational complexity, we propose a lightweight\nquadratic enhancer that uses low-rankness, weight sharing, and sparsification\ntechniques. For a fixed architecture, the proposed approach introduces\nquadratic interactions between features at every layer, while only adding\nnegligible amounts of additional model parameters and forward computations. We\nconduct a set of proof-of-concept experiments for the proposed method across\nthree tasks: image classification, text classification, and fine-tuning\nlarge-language models.

AI explainability should\nfollow this principle: stakeholders need verifiable reasoning chains, not\nmechanistic transparency. We propose using structured argumentation to provide\na level of explanation and verification neither interpretability nor\nLLM-generated explanation is able to offer. Our pipeline achieves\nstate-of-the-art 94.44 macro F1 on the AAEC published train/test split (5.7\npoints above prior work) and $0.81$ macro F1, $\\sim$0.07 above previous\npublished results with comparable data setups, for Argumentative MicroTexts\nrelation classification, converting LLM text into argument graphs and enabling\nverification at each inferential step. We demonstrate this idea on multi-agent\nrisk assessment using the Structured What-If Technique, where specialized\nagents collaborate transparently to carry out risk assessment otherwise\nachieved by humans alone.

A ``goal''\nhere refers to an information need or task, such as asking for policy\ninformation or applying for leave. We propose a comprehensive framework for\ngoal-oriented evaluation of multi-agent systems (MAS), introducing the\n\\textbf{Goal Success Rate (GSR)} to measure the percentage of fulfilled goals,\nand a \\textbf{Root Cause of Failure (RCOF)} taxonomy to identify reasons for\nfailure in multi-agent chatbots. Our method segments conversations by user\ngoals and evaluates success using all relevant turns. We present a model-based\nevaluation system combining teacher LLMs, where domain experts define goals,\nset quality standards serving as a guidance for the LLMs. The LLMs use\n``thinking tokens'' to produce interpretable rationales, enabling\n\\textit{explainable}, \\textit{data-efficient} evaluations. In an enterprise\nsetting, we apply our framework to evaluate AIDA, a zero-to-one employee\nconversational agent system built as a ground-up multi-agent conversational\nagent, and observe GSR improvement from 63\\% to 79\\% over six months since its\ninception.

While much of the literature has focused on attention\nmechanisms, the role of pooling remains underexplored despite its critical\nimpact on model behavior. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework\nthat rigorously characterizes the expressivity of Transformer-based models\nequipped with widely used pooling methods by deriving closed-form bounds on\ntheir representational capacity and the ability to distinguish similar inputs.\nOur analysis extends to different variations of attention formulations,\ndemonstrating that these bounds hold across diverse architectural variants. We\nempirically evaluate pooling strategies across tasks requiring both global and\nlocal contextual understanding, spanning three major modalities: computer\nvision, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. Results reveal\nconsistent trends in how pooling choices affect accuracy, sensitivity, and\noptimization behavior. Our findings unify theoretical and empirical\nperspectives, providing practical guidance for selecting or designing pooling\nmechanisms suited to specific tasks. This work positions pooling as a key\narchitectural component in Transformer models and lays the foundation for more\nprincipled model design beyond attention alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "Transformer

Drawing inspiration from insect colonies, which\nachieve robust coordination through stigmergy -- modifying and interpreting\nenvironmental traces -- we propose a Stigmergic Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (S-MADRL) framework that leverages virtual pheromones to model local\nand social interactions, enabling decentralized emergent coordination without\nexplicit communication. To overcome the convergence and scalability limitations\nof existing algorithms such as MADQN, MADDPG, and MAPPO, we leverage curriculum\nlearning, which decomposes complex tasks into progressively harder\nsub-problems. Simulation results show that our framework achieves the most\neffective coordination of up to eight agents, where robots self-organize into\nasymmetric workload distributions that reduce congestion and modulate group\nperformance. This emergent behavior, analogous to strategies observed in\nnature, demonstrates a scalable solution for decentralized multi-agent\ncoordination in crowded environments with communication constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc881\uace0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ub85c\ubd07\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc728\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c S-MADRL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc881\uace0 \ud63c\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub85c\ubd07\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uac00\uc0c1 \ud398\ub85c\ubaac\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 Stigmergic Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (S-MADRL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ucd5c\ub300 8\uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub85c\ubd07\ub4e4\uc774 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud63c\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc790\uc5f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc790\ubc1c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud63c\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud63c\uc7a1\uacfc \uac04\uc12d\uc774 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc881\uace0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub85c\ubd07\uc744 \uc870\uc728\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud658\uacbd\uc801 \ud754\uc801\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \uace4\ucda9 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac00\uc0c1 \ud398\ub85c\ubaac\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 Stigmergic Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (S-MADRL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Usage control policies have\nemerged as a key paradigm for regulating data usage, safeguarding privacy,\nprotecting intellectual property, and ensuring compliance with regulations. A\ncentral mechanism for usage control is the handling of obligations, which arise\nas a side effect of using and sharing data. Effective monitoring of obligations\nrequires capturing usage traces and accounting for temporal aspects such as\nstart times and deadlines, as obligations may evolve over times into different\nstates, such as fulfilled, violated, or expired. While several solutions have\nbeen proposed for obligation monitoring, they often lack formal semantics or\nprovide limited support for reasoning over obligation states. To address these\nlimitations, we extend GUCON, a policy framework grounded in the formal\nsemantics of SPAQRL graph patterns, to explicitly model the temporal aspects of\nan obligation. This extension enables the expressing of temporal obligations\nand supports continuous monitoring of their evolving states based on usage\ntraces stored in temporal knowledge graphs. We demonstrate how this extended\nmodel can be represented using RDF-star and SPARQL-star and propose an\nObligation State Manager that monitors obligation states and assess their\ncompliance with respect to usage traces. Finally, we evaluate both the extended\nmodel and its prototype implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uad00\ub9ac\uc758

Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models\n(MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and\ngeneration. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world\nmodels. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual\nreasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information,\ncontrol generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We\ninvestigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation\nmodels and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of\nMFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning\nskills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal\nreasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand\ndeeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore\ngenerative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and\nvideo modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable\ngeneration. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning,\nand multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring\nconsistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further\nextend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive,\neditable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

We approach this\nchallenge by designing a framework for modeling and evaluating disease-spread\nprevention strategies. Our framework leverages multi-objective reinforcement\nlearning (MORL) - a formulation necessitated by competing objectives - combined\nwith a new stochastic differential equation (SDE) pandemic simulator,\ncalibrated and validated against global COVID-19 data. Our simulator reproduces\nnational-scale pandemic dynamics with orders of magnitude higher fidelity than\nother models commonly used in reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to\npandemic intervention. Training a Pareto-Conditioned Network (PCN) agent on\nthis simulator, we illustrate the direct policy trade-offs between\nepidemiological control and economic stability for COVID-19. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the framework's generality by extending it to pathogens with\ndifferent epidemiological profiles, such as polio and influenza, and show how\nthese profiles lead the agent to discover fundamentally different intervention\npolicies. To ground our work in contemporary policymaking challenges, we apply\nthe model to measles outbreaks, quantifying how a modest 5% drop in vaccination\ncoverage necessitates significantly more stringent and costly interventions to\ncurb disease spread.

Existing multi-agent HAB\ncoordination approaches use deterministic methods like Voronoi partitioning and\nextremum seeking control for large global constellations, which perform poorly\nfor smaller teams and localized missions. While single-agent HAB control using\nreinforcement learning has been demonstrated on HABs, coordinated multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) has not yet been investigated. This work presents\nthe first systematic application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)\nto HAB coordination for distributed area coverage. We extend our previously\ndeveloped reinforcement learning simulation environment (RLHAB) to support\ncooperative multi-agent learning, enabling multiple agents to operate\nsimultaneously in realistic atmospheric conditions. We adapt QMIX for HAB area\ncoverage coordination, leveraging Centralized Training with Decentralized\nExecution to address atmospheric vehicle coordination challenges. Our approach\nemploys specialized observation spaces providing individual state,\nenvironmental context, and teammate data, with hierarchical rewards\nprioritizing coverage while encouraging spatial distribution.

Recent defenses against prompt injection, such as Instruction Hierarchy\nand SecAlign, have shown notable robustness against static attacks. However, to\nmore thoroughly evaluate the robustness of these defenses, it is arguably\nnecessary to employ strong attacks such as automated red-teaming. To this end,\nwe introduce RL-Hammer, a simple recipe for training attacker models that\nautomatically learn to perform strong prompt injections and jailbreaks via\nreinforcement learning. RL-Hammer requires no warm-up data and can be trained\nentirely from scratch. To achieve high ASRs against industrial-level models\nwith defenses, we propose a set of practical techniques that enable highly\neffective, universal attacks. Using this pipeline, RL-Hammer reaches a 98% ASR\nagainst GPT-4o and a $72\\%$ ASR against GPT-5 with the Instruction Hierarchy\ndefense. We further discuss the challenge of achieving high diversity in\nattacks, highlighting how attacker models tend to reward-hack diversity\nobjectives. Finally, we show that RL-Hammer can evade multiple prompt injection\ndetectors. We hope our work advances automatic red-teaming and motivates the\ndevelopment of stronger, more principled defenses.

While LLMs excel in verifiable tasks like coding and mathematics,\nwhere gold-standard solutions are available, adoption remains challenging for\nsubjective tasks that lack a single correct answer. E-commerce Query Rewriting\n(QR) is one such problem where determining whether a rewritten query properly\ncaptures the user intent is extremely difficult to figure out algorithmically.\nIn this work, we introduce OptAgent, a novel framework that combines\nmulti-agent simulations with genetic algorithms to verify and optimize queries\nfor QR.

For example, a game of chess between two state-of-the-art agents\nmay take hours. A critical bottleneck is that agent behavior unfolds\nsequentially: each action requires an API call, and these calls can be\ntime-consuming. Inspired by speculative execution in microprocessors and\nspeculative decoding in LLM inference, we propose speculative actions, a\nlossless framework for general agentic systems that predicts likely actions\nusing faster models, enabling multiple steps to be executed in parallel. We\nevaluate this framework across three agentic environments: gaming, e-commerce,\nweb search, and a \"lossy\" extension for an operating systems environment. In\nall cases, speculative actions achieve substantial accuracy in next-action\nprediction (up to 55%), translating into significant reductions in end-to-end\nlatency. Moreover, performance can be further improved through stronger\nguessing models, top-K action prediction, multi-step speculation, and\nuncertainty-aware optimization, opening a promising path toward deploying\nlow-latency agentic systems in the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud658\uacbd \uc2e4\ud589 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \ub290\ub824 \uad50\uc721, \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0ac\uc804 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube60\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ubcd1\ub82c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784, \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798, \uc6f9 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \uccb4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ub2e4\uc74c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc0c1\uc704 K \uac1c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\uce21 \ubc0f \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub290\ub824 \ud6c8\ub828, \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uccb4\uc2a4 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uba87 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774\ub098 \uac78\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uac1c\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc774\ub2e4: \uac01 \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 API \ud638\ucd9c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud638\ucd9c\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc18c\uc694\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ube60\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ubcd1\ub82c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac8c\uc784, \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798, \uc6f9 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \uccb4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc758 '\uc190\uc2e4 \uc788\ub294' \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 (\ucd5c\ub300 55%)\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc0c1\uc704 K \ud589\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\uce21 \ubc0f \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc800\uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc5f4\uc5b4 \uc900\ub2e4."}}

We introduce the\nhidden game problem, where for each player, an unknown subset of strategies\nconsistently yields higher rewards compared to the rest. The central question\nis whether efficient regret minimization algorithms can be designed to discover\nand exploit such hidden structures, leading to equilibrium in these subgames\nwhile maintaining rationality in general. We answer this question affirmatively\nby developing a composition of regret minimization techniques that achieve\noptimal external and swap regret bounds.

LEGOMem decomposes\npast task trajectories into reusable memory units and flexibly allocates them\nacross orchestrators and task agents to support planning and execution. To\nexplore the design space of memory in multi-agent systems, we use LEGOMem as a\nlens and conduct a systematic study of procedural memory in multi-agent\nsystems, examining where memory should be placed, how it should be retrieved,\nand which agents benefit most. Experiments on the OfficeBench benchmark show\nthat orchestrator memory is critical for effective task decomposition and\ndelegation, while fine-grained agent memory improves execution accuracy. We\nfind that even teams composed of smaller language models can benefit\nsubstantially from procedural memory, narrowing the performance gap with\nstronger agents by leveraging prior execution traces for more accurate planning\nand tool use.

We\nsynthesize recent evidence across open and proprietary SLMs (Phi-4-Mini,\nQwen-2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2-1B/3B, Ministral-3B/8B, Apple on-device 3B,\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill) and connect it to modern evaluations (BFCL v3/v4,\nStableToolBench) and serving stacks (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM) paired with\nguided decoding libraries (XGrammar, Outlines). We formalize SLM-default,\nLLM-fallback systems with uncertainty-aware routing and verifier cascades, and\npropose engineering metrics that reflect real production goals: cost per\nsuccessful task (CPS), schema validity rate, executable call rate, p50/p95\nlatency, and energy per request. Guided decoding, strict JSON Schema outputs,\nand validator-first tool execution close much of the capability gap with larger\nmodels and often let SLMs match or surpass LLMs on tool use, function calling,\nand RAG at 10x-100x lower token cost with materially better latency and energy.\nWe provide design patterns for agent stacks that prioritize SLMs: schema-first\nprompting, type-safe function registries, confidence scoring with verifier\nrollups, and lightweight adaptation via LoRA/QLoRA. We also delineate limits\nwhere fallback remains valuable (open-domain reasoning and some long-horizon\nplanning). The result is a practical blueprint for building fast, inexpensive,\nand reliable agents that default to SLMs while preserving headroom with\ntargeted LLM assistance.\n  Keywords: small language models, agents, function calling, structured\noutputs, JSON Schema, guided decoding, LoRA/QLoRA, routing, energy efficiency,\nedge inference", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc791\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(SLMs)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ubd80\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc791\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud070 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd5c\uc2e0 SLM\uc744 \uc885\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ud604\ub300 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "SLM\uc774 LLM\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uacfc \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SLM\uc744 \uae30\ubcf8\uc73c\ub85c \uc0bc\uace0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0 LLM\uc744 \ubcf4\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc800\ub834\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uccad\uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(SLMs;

While prior works use graph\nneural network (GNN) approaches for disorder prediction, they remain complex\nblack-boxes, limiting their reliability and clinical translation. In this work,\nwe propose CONCEPTNEURO, a concept-based diagnosis framework that leverages\nlarge language models (LLMs) and neurobiological domain knowledge to\nautomatically generate, filter, and encode interpretable functional\nconnectivity concepts. Each concept is represented as a structured subgraph\nlinking specific brain regions, which are then passed through a concept\nclassifier. Our design ensures predictions through clinically meaningful\nconnectivity patterns, enabling both interpretability and strong predictive\nperformance. Extensive experiments across multiple psychiatric disorder\ndatasets demonstrate that CONCEPTNEURO-augmented GNNs consistently outperform\ntheir vanilla counterparts, improving accuracy while providing transparent,\nclinically aligned explanations. Furthermore, concept analyses highlight\ndisorder-specific connectivity patterns that align with expert knowledge and\nsuggest new hypotheses for future investigation, establishing CONCEPTNEURO as\nan interpretable, domain-informed framework for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc815\uc2e0 \uc7a5\uc560 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud574\uc11d

Monitoring failures usually happen\nin dynamic, high dimensional situations, especially when data is incomplete,\nmessy or always evolving. Such limits point out the requirement for adaptive,\nintelligent systems that always improve and think. LLMs are now capable of\nsignificantly changing how context is understood and semantic inference is done\nacross all types of data. This proposal suggests using an LLM supported\ncontextual reasoning method along with XAI agents to improve how anomalies are\nfound in significant IoT environments. To discover hidden patterns and notice\ninconsistencies in data streams, it uses attention methods, avoids dealing with\ndetails from every time step and uses memory buffers with meaning. Because no\ncode AI stresses transparency and interpretability, people can check and accept\nthe AI's decisions, helping ensure AI follows company policies. The two\narchitectures are put together in a test that compares the results of the\ntraditional model with those of the suggested LLM enhanced model. Important\nmeasures to check are the accuracy of detection, how much inaccurate\ninformation is included in the results, how clearly the findings can be read\nand how fast the system responds under different test situations. The\nmetaheuristic is tested in simulations of real world smart grid and healthcare\ncontexts to check its adaptability and reliability. From the study, we see that\nthe new approach performs much better than most existing models in both\naccuracy and interpretation, so it could be a good fit for future anomaly\ndetection tasks in IoT", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 IoT \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc XAI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "IoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc740 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2e0\uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\uc874 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub098\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LLM \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc XAI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70, \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\uc11c\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud574\uc11d\ub825 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 IoT\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc911\uc694\ud55c IoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud558\uac8c \uc791\ub3d9\ub418\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \ucc3e\uc544\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c, \uae30\uc874 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \ub354\uc6b1 \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2e4\ud328\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uace0 \uc0ac\uace0\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

A Hierarchical Look into Multi-Agent Error Attribution", "comment": null, "summary": "Error attribution in Large Language Model (LLM) multi-agent systems presents\na significant challenge in debugging and improving collaborative AI systems.\nCurrent approaches to pinpointing agent and step level failures in interaction\ntraces - whether using all-at-once evaluation, step-by-step analysis, or binary\nsearch - fall short when analyzing complex patterns, struggling with both\naccuracy and consistency. We present ECHO (Error attribution through Contextual\nHierarchy and Objective consensus analysis), a novel algorithm that combines\nhierarchical context representation, objective analysis-based evaluation, and\nconsensus voting to improve error attribution accuracy. Our approach leverages\na positional-based leveling of contextual understanding while maintaining\nobjective evaluation criteria, ultimately reaching conclusions through a\nconsensus mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms\nexisting methods across various multi-agent interaction scenarios, showing\nparticular strength in cases involving subtle reasoning errors and complex\ninterdependencies. Our findings suggest that leveraging these concepts of\nstructured, hierarchical context representation combined with consensus-based\nobjective decision-making, provides a more robust framework for error\nattribution in multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "ECHO \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 LLM \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc624\ub958 \uadc0\uc18d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc0f \ud569\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ub958 \uadc0\uc18d \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub958 \uadc0\uc18d\uc740 \ud611\uc5c5 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ECHO\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604, \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd84\uc11d \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ud569\uc758 \ud22c\ud45c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ECHO\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc624\ub958 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud788 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ud569\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc624\ub958 \uadc0\uc18d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub958 \uadc0\uc18d\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc801 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub514\ubc84\uae45\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ucd94\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \ub54c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ub958 \uadc0\uc18d \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d \ud45c\ud604, \uac1d\uad00\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ud569\uc758 \ud22c\ud45c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 ECHO(\uc8fc\ubcc0 \uacc4\uce35 \ubc0f \uac1d\uad00\uc801 \ud569\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc624\ub958 \uadc0\uc18d)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uac1d\uad00\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub9e5\ub77d \uc774\ud574\uc758 \uc704\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc218\uc900 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacb0\ub860\uc5d0 \uc774\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 ECHO\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc624\ub958 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ud569\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \uac1d\uad00\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub958 \uadc0\uc18d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Using tweets of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), small\nadversarial perturbations such as synonym replacement, negation insertion, and\nrandomized perturbation were introduced into the support examples. Even these\nminor manipulations caused major disruptions, with sentiment labels flipping in\nup to 67% of cases. To address this, a Spectral Signature Defense was applied,\nwhich filtered out poisoned examples while keeping the data's meaning and\nsentiment intact. After defense, ICL accuracy remained steady at around 46.7%,\nand logistic regression validation reached 100% accuracy, showing that the\ndefense successfully preserved the dataset's integrity. Overall, the findings\nextend prior theoretical studies of ICL poisoning to a practical, high-stakes\nsetting in public health discourse analysis, highlighting both the risks and\npotential defenses for robust LLM deployment.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet\neffective intervention that surfaces rare semantics inside MM-DiTs without\nadditional training steps, data, denoising-time optimization, or reliance on\nexternal modules (e.g., large language models). In particular, the\njoint-attention mechanism intrinsic to MM-DiT sequentially updates text\nembeddings alongside image embeddings throughout transformer blocks. We find\nthat by mathematically expanding representational basins around text token\nembeddings via variance scale-up before the joint-attention blocks, rare\nsemantics clearly emerge in MM-DiT's outputs. Furthermore, our results\ngeneralize effectively across text-to-vision tasks, including text-to-image,\ntext-to-video, and text-driven image editing.

The first challenge arises from the sheer volume of data that needs\nto be processed. Flagging anomalies in a high-throughput environment calls for\na careful consideration of both algorithm and system design. The second\nchallenge comes from the heterogeneity of time-series datasets that leverage\nsuch a system in production. In practice, anomaly detection systems are rarely\ndeployed for a single use case. Typically, there are several metrics to\nmonitor, often across several domains (e.g. engineering, business and\noperations). A one-size-fits-all approach rarely works, so these systems need\nto be fine-tuned for every application - this is often done manually. The third\nchallenge comes from the fact that determining the root-cause of anomalies in\nsuch settings is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Identifying (in real\ntime) a time-series dataset that is associated causally with the anomalous\ntime-series data is a very difficult problem. In this paper, we describe a\nunified framework that addresses these challenges. Reasoning based Anomaly\nDetection Framework (RADF) is designed to perform real time anomaly detection\non very large datasets. This framework employs a novel technique (mSelect) that\nautomates the process of algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning for\neach use case. Finally, it incorporates a post-detection capability that allows\nfor faster triaging and root-cause determination.

We propose \\textit{Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow\nMatching} (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics\njointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a\npiecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and\njointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a\ntheoretical condition for stable learning.

However, these models lack language-based reasoning capabilities,\nlimiting their utility in interactive scientific workflows. Large language\nmodels (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating text but cannot reason\nabout high-dimensional meteorological datasets. We bridge this gap by building\na novel agentic framework for weather science. Our framework includes a Python\ncode-based environment for agents (ZephyrusWorld) to interact with weather\ndata, featuring tools like an interface to WeatherBench 2 dataset, geoquerying\nfor geographical masks from natural language, weather forecasting, and climate\nsimulation capabilities. We design Zephyrus, a multi-turn LLM-based weather\nagent that iteratively analyzes weather datasets, observes results, and refines\nits approach through conversational feedback loops. We accompany the agent with\na new benchmark, ZephyrusBench, with a scalable data generation pipeline that\nconstructs diverse question-answer pairs across weather-related tasks, from\nbasic lookups to advanced forecasting, extreme event detection, and\ncounterfactual reasoning. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the strong\nperformance of Zephyrus agents over text-only baselines, outperforming them by\nup to 35 percentage points in correctness. However, on harder tasks, Zephyrus\nperforms similarly to text-only baselines, highlighting the challenging nature\nof our benchmark and suggesting promising directions for future work.", "AI":

In addition to\nlifecycle coverage, we annotate each agent along five cross-cutting design\ndimensions: reasoning and planning style, modality integration, tool\norchestration depth, learning and alignment methods, and trust, safety, and\ngovernance mechanisms. Beyond classification, we provide a critical synthesis\nof agent capabilities, highlight strengths and limitations at each stage, and\nreview emerging benchmarks and evaluation practices. Our analysis identifies\nthree key trends: most systems emphasize exploratory analysis, visualization,\nand modeling while neglecting business understanding, deployment, and\nmonitoring; multimodal reasoning and tool orchestration remain unresolved\nchallenges; and over 90% lack explicit trust and safety mechanisms.

FD systems typically use edge devices (EDs)\nworn by individuals to collect real-time data, which are transmitted to a cloud\ncenter (CC) or processed locally. However, this architecture faces challenges\nsuch as a limited ED model size and data transmission latency to the CC. Mobile\nedge computing (MEC), which allows computations at MEC servers deployed between\nEDs and CC, has been explored to address these challenges. We propose a\nmultilayer MEC (MLMEC) framework to balance accuracy and latency. The MLMEC\nsplits the architecture into stations, each with a neural network model. If\nfront-end equipment cannot detect falls reliably, data are transmitted to a\nstation with more robust back-end computing. The knowledge distillation (KD)\napproach was employed to improve front-end detection accuracy by allowing\nhigh-power back-end stations to provide additional learning experiences,\nenhancing precision while reducing latency and processing loads. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the KD approach improved accuracy by 11.65% on the\nSisFall dataset and 2.78% on the FallAllD dataset. The MLMEC with KD also\nreduced the data latency rate by 54.15% on the FallAllD dataset and 46.67% on\nthe SisFall dataset compared to the MLMEC without KD. In summary, the MLMEC FD\nsystem exhibits improved accuracy and reduced latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLMEC FD \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub178\uc778 \uc778\uad6c\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub099\uc0c1 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MLMEC \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac01 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uace0, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc31\uc5d4\ub4dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "KD \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 SisFall \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c 11.65%, FallAllD \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c 2.78% \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MLMEC FD \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uac10\uc18c\ub41c \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae09\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ub178\uc778 \uc778\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \uae30\uc220\ub85c\uc11c \ub099\uc0c1 \uac10\uc9c0(FD) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ub110\ub9ac \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However,\nhealthcare's rapidly growing clinical AI stack has no equivalent. As hospitals\nrush to pilot large language models and other AI-based clinical decision\nsupport tools, we still lack a standard way to record how, when, by whom, and\nfor whom these AI models are used. Without that transparency and visibility, it\nis challenging to measure real-world performance and outcomes, detect adverse\nevents, or correct bias or dataset drift. In the spirit of syslog, we introduce\nMedLog, a protocol for event-level logging of clinical AI. Any time an AI model\nis invoked to interact with a human, interface with another algorithm, or act\nindependently, a MedLog record is created. This record consists of nine core\nfields: header, model, user, target, inputs, artifacts, outputs, outcomes, and\nfeedback, providing a structured and consistent record of model activity. To\nencourage early adoption, especially in low-resource settings, and minimize the\ndata footprint, MedLog supports risk-based sampling, lifecycle-aware retention\npolicies, and write-behind caching; detailed traces for complex, agentic, or\nmulti-stage workflows can also be captured under MedLog. MedLog can catalyze\nthe development of new databases and software to store and analyze MedLog\nrecords.

Yet, this\nintegration raises critical concerns about value alignment - ensuring AI\nbehaviors remain consistent with human ethics and intentions. A key risk is\nvalue drift, where AI systems deviate from aligned values due to evolving\ncontexts, learning dynamics, or unintended optimizations, potentially leading\nto inefficiencies or ethical breaches. We propose the Moral Anchor System\n(MAS), a novel framework to detect, predict, and mitigate value drift in AI\nagents. MAS combines real-time Bayesian inference for monitoring value states,\nLSTM networks for forecasting drift, and a human-centric governance layer for\nadaptive interventions. It emphasizes low-latency responses (<20 ms) to prevent\nbreaches, while reducing false positives and alert fatigue via supervised\nfine-tuning with human feedback. Our hypothesis: integrating probabilistic\ndrift detection, predictive analytics, and adaptive governance can reduce value\ndrift incidents by 80 percent or more in simulations, maintaining high\ndetection accuracy (85 percent) and low false positive rates (0.08\npost-adaptation).

However, designing such workflows demands substantial manual\neffort, posing challenges to scalability and generalizability. Recent studies\nhave aimed to minimize the human intervention needed for their construction,\nleading to advances in automated techniques for optimizing agentic workflows.\nHowever, current approaches are often constrained by their limited\nrepresentational capacity, insufficient adaptability, weak scalability, and\npairwise comparison paradigm -- issues that stem primarily from a dependence on\ndiscrete optimization techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a\nnew score-based preference approach, refereed as SPOGW, which operates directly\non cardinal reward signals through group-wise comparison and enables more\nefficient and stable optimization in a continuous space. SPOGW incorporates\nIterative offline GRPO (ioGRPO) with advantage-masked KL divergence (mKL),\nwhich regulates training update by placing greater emphasis on the advantageous\nregions of the policy response.

Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models\n(LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are\nprone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment\ncontinuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs,\nexacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional\neducational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a\nDiffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first\nconstructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies\nrelation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two\nsubgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived,\nsemantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment\nstep, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate\nintrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment.\nSpecifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous\ninformation, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided\nto eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation\nthat integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into\nexisting cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on\nthree publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate\nthat our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise\nlevels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while\neffectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "DLLM\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 LLM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uac15\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud45c\ud604 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ub3d5\ub294\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uad50\uc721 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac1c\ub150 \uc2b5\ub4dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "DLLM\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc815\ub2f5\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc704 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad00\uacc4 \uc99d\uac15 \uc870\uc815 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uacf5\uacf5 \uc6f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uad50\uc721 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, DLLM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DLLM\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uad50\uc721 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(WIES)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc9c0 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac1c\ub150 \uc219\ub2ec\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, LLM\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 WIES\uc758 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud559\uc0dd\uc744 \uc720\uce58\ud558\uace0 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc591\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5 \ub85c\uadf8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uad50\uc721 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubc0f \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uac15\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 LLM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 DLLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Advances in multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) have made WebUI-to-Code increasingly feasible, yet\nexisting benchmarks remain limited in data diversity and evaluation\nreliability. To address these issues, we present WebRenderBench, a large-scale\nbenchmark of 22.5k webpages collected from real-world portal sites, offering\ngreater diversity, complexity, and realism than prior benchmarks. We further\npropose a novel evaluation metric that measures layout and style consistency\nfrom the final rendered pages. Unlike vision-based methods that rely on costly\nLLM reasoning or structure-based comparisons vulnerable to noise and asymmetry,\nour approach enables more efficient, objective, and reliable UI quality\nassessment.

To this end, we introduce Graphon\nNeural Differential Equations (Graphon-NDEs) as the infinite-node limit of\nGNDEs and establish their well-posedness. Leveraging tools from graphon theory\nand dynamical systems, we prove the trajectory-wise convergence of GNDE\nsolutions to Graphon-NDE solutions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence\nrates under two deterministic graph sampling regimes: (1) weighted graphs\nsampled from smooth graphons, and (2) unweighted graphs sampled from\n$\\{0,1\\}$-valued (discontinuous) graphons. We further establish size\ntransferability bounds, providing theoretical justification for the practical\nstrategy of transferring GNDE models trained on moderate-sized graphs to\nlarger, structurally similar graphs without retraining.

Utilizing Category-Wise Influence Functions for Pareto Frontier Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Data-centric learning seeks to improve model performance from the perspective\nof data quality, and has been drawing increasing attention in the machine\nlearning community. Among its key tools, influence functions provide a powerful\nframework to quantify the impact of individual training samples on model\npredictions, enabling practitioners to identify detrimental samples and retrain\nmodels on a cleaner dataset for improved performance. However, most existing\nwork focuses on the question: \"what data benefits the learning model?\" In this\npaper, we take a step further and investigate a more fundamental question:\n\"what is the performance ceiling of the learning model?\" Unlike prior studies\nthat primarily measure improvement through overall accuracy, we emphasize\ncategory-wise accuracy and aim for Pareto improvements, ensuring that every\nclass benefits, rather than allowing tradeoffs where some classes improve at\nthe expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose category-wise\ninfluence functions and introduce an influence vector that quantifies the\nimpact of each training sample across all categories. Leveraging these\ninfluence vectors, we develop a principled criterion to determine whether a\nmodel can still be improved, and further design a linear programming-based\nsample reweighting framework to achieve Pareto performance improvements.\nThrough extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, vision, and text\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating

However, such context-dependent querying becomes incapable\nas the environment grows much longer, motivating the need for incremental map\nconstruction that builds a complete topological graph from stepwise\nobservations.

Central to our method is the\nVersion Control, which records the full history of graph edits and their source\nobservations, enabling fine-grained rollback, conflict tracing, and repair\nevaluation. We further introduce an Edge Impact Score to prioritize\nminimal-cost repairs based on structural reachability, path usage, and conflict\npropagation. To properly evaluate our approach, we create a refined version of\nthe MANGO benchmark dataset by systematically removing non-topological actions\nand inherent structural conflicts, providing a cleaner testbed for LLM-driven\nconstruction and map repair. Our approach significantly improves map\ncorrectness and robustness, especially in scenarios with entangled or chained\ninconsistencies. Our results highlight the importance of introspective,\nhistory-aware repair mechanisms for maintaining coherent spatial memory in LLM\nagents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

In this work, we present the\nAgentRL framework for scalable multi-turn, multi-task agentic RL training. On\nthe infrastructure side, AgentRL features a fully-asynchronous\ngeneration-training pipeline for efficient multi-turn RL. To support\nheterogeneous environment development in multi-task RL, we design a unified\nfunction-call based API interface, containerized environment development, and a\ncentralized controller. On the algorithm side, we propose cross-policy sampling\nto encourage model exploration in multi-turn settings and task advantage\nnormalization to stabilize multi-task training. Experiments show that AgentRL,\ntrained on open LLMs across five agentic tasks, significantly outperforms\nGPT-5, Clause-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-R1, and other open-source LLM agents.\nMulti-task training with AgentRL matches the best results among all\ntask-specific models.

Yet, for LLM generation with multiple choice\nstructure, the state-of-the-art in UQ is still dominated by the naive baseline\ngiven by the maximum softmax score. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate\nthat taking a principled approach via Bayesian statistics leads to improved\nperformance despite leveraging the simplest possible model, namely linear\nregression. More precisely, we propose to train multiple Bayesian linear\nmodels, each predicting the output of a layer given the output of the previous\none. Based on the obtained layer-level posterior distributions, we infer the\nglobal uncertainty level of the LLM by identifying a sparse combination of\ndistributional features, leading to an efficient UQ scheme.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in\nreinforcement learning (RL), offer promising avenues to address this\nfundamental challenge. This paper proposes a unified multi-agent RL framework\ntailored for joint optimization across distinct functional modules, exemplified\nvia coordinating inventory replenishment and personalized product\nrecommendation. We first develop an integrated theoretical model to capture the\nintricate interplay between these functions and derive analytical benchmarks\nthat characterize optimal coordination. The analysis reveals synchronized\nadjustment patterns across products and over time, highlighting the importance\nof coordinated decision-making. Leveraging these insights, we design a novel\nmulti-timescale multi-agent RL architecture that decomposes policy components\naccording to departmental functions and assigns distinct learning speeds based\non task complexity and responsiveness. Our model-free multi-agent design\nimproves scalability and deployment flexibility, while multi-timescale updates\nenhance convergence stability and adaptability across heterogeneous decisions.\nWe further establish the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm.\nExtensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach\nsignificantly improves profitability relative to siloed decision-making\nframeworks, while the behaviors of the trained RL agents align closely with the\nmanagerial insights from our theoretical model. Taken together, this work\nprovides a scalable, interpretable RL-based solution to enable effective\ncross-functional coordination in complex business settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Tuning hyperparameters is a\nmanual and computationally expensive process as the hyperparameter space grows\ncombinatorially with the number of clients. To address this, we introduce an\nend-to-end adaptive federated learning method in which both clients and central\nagents adaptively select their local learning rates and momentum parameters.\nOur approach models federated learning as a dynamical system, allowing us to\ndraw on principles from numerical simulation and physical design. Through this\nperspective, selecting momentum parameters equates to critically damping the\nsystem for fast, stable convergence, while learning rates for clients and\ncentral servers are adaptively selected to satisfy accuracy properties from\nnumerical simulation. The result is an adaptive, momentum-based federated\nlearning algorithm in which the learning rates for clients and servers are\ndynamically adjusted and controlled by a single, global hyperparameter. By\ndesigning a fully integrated solution for both adaptive client updates and\ncentral agent aggregation, our method is capable of handling key challenges of\nheterogeneous federated learning, including objective inconsistency and client\ndrift. Importantly, our approach achieves fast convergence while being\ninsensitive to the choice of the global hyperparameter, making it well-suited\nfor rapid prototyping and scalable deployment. Compared to state-of-the-art\nadaptive methods, our framework is shown to deliver superior convergence for\nheterogeneous federated learning while eliminating the need for hyperparameter\ntuning both client and server updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\ub3d9\uc9c8 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130

Existing\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable accuracy on medical\ndecision-making benchmarks. However, they often lack the ability to conduct the\nstrategic and empathetic consultation, which is essential for real-world\nclinical scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Doctor-R1, an AI doctor\nagent trained to master both of the capabilities by ask high-yield questions\nand conduct strategic multi-turn inquiry to guide decision-making. Our\nframework introduces three key components: a multi-agent interactive\nenvironment, a two-tiered reward architecture that separately optimizes\nclinical decision-making and communicative inquiry skills, and an experience\nrepository to ground policy learning in high-quality prior trajectories. We\nevaluate Doctor-R1 on OpenAI's HealthBench and MAQuE, assessed across\nmulti-facet metrics, such as communication quality, user experience, and task\naccuracy. Remarkably, Doctor-R1 surpasses state-of-the-art open-source\nspecialized LLMs by a substantial margin with higher parameter efficiency and\noutperforms powerful proprietary models.

This paper introduces\nPolyKAN, a novel theoretical framework for KAN compression that provides formal\nguarantees on both model size reduction and approximation error. By leveraging\nthe inherent piecewise polynomial structure of KANs, we formulate the\ncompression problem as one of optimal polyhedral region merging. We establish a\nrigorous polyhedral characterization of KANs, develop a complete theory of\n$\\epsilon$-equivalent compression, and design an optimal dynamic programming\nalgorithm that guarantees minimal compression under specified error bounds. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that PolyKAN achieves provably minimal\ncompression while maintaining strict error control, with polynomial-time\ncomplexity in all network parameters.

Compared to\ntraditional kernel SGD, our algorithm improves efficiency and scalability\nthrough an innovative regularization strategy. By leveraging the infinite\nseries expansion of spherical radial basis functions, this strategy projects\nthe stochastic gradient onto a finite-dimensional hypothesis space, which is\nadaptively scaled according to the bias-variance trade-off, thereby enhancing\ngeneralization performance. Based on a new estimation of the spectral structure\nof the kernel-induced covariance operator, we develop an analytical framework\nthat unifies optimization and generalization analyses. We prove that both the\nlast iterate and the suffix average converge at minimax-optimal rates, and we\nfurther establish optimal strong convergence in the reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace. Our framework accommodates a broad class of classical loss functions,\nincluding least-squares, Huber, and logistic losses. Moreover, the proposed\nalgorithm significantly reduces computational complexity and achieves optimal\nstorage complexity by incorporating coordinate-wise updates from linear SGD,\nthereby avoiding the costly pairwise operations typical of kernel SGD and\nenabling efficient processing of streaming data.

These strategies are\nimpractical for closed-source models and expensive for open-source ones, with\nrisks of catastrophic forgetting. Offline trajectories offer reusable\nknowledge, yet demonstration-based methods struggle because raw traces are\nlong, noisy, and tied to specific tasks. We present Just-in-time Episodic\nFeedback Hinter (JEF Hinter), an agentic system that distills offline traces\ninto compact, context-aware hints. A zooming mechanism highlights decisive\nsteps in long trajectories, capturing both strategies and pitfalls. Unlike\nprior methods, JEF Hinter leverages both successful and failed trajectories,\nextracting guidance even when only failure data is available, while supporting\nparallelized hint generation and benchmark-independent prompting.

Existing works\non performative reinforcement learning only aim at a performatively stable (PS)\npolicy that maximizes an approximate value function. However, there is a\nprovably positive constant gap between the PS policy and the desired\nperformatively optimal (PO) policy that maximizes the original value function.\nIn contrast, this work proposes a zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe algorithm (0-FW)\nalgorithm with a zeroth-order approximation of the performative policy gradient\nin the Frank-Wolfe framework, and obtains \\textbf{the first polynomial-time\nconvergence to the desired PO} policy under the standard regularizer dominance\ncondition. For the convergence analysis, we prove two important properties of\nthe nonconvex value function. First, when the policy regularizer dominates the\nenvironmental shift, the value function satisfies a certain gradient dominance\nproperty, so that any stationary point (not PS) of the value function is a\ndesired PO. Second, though the value function has unbounded gradient, we prove\nthat all the sufficiently stationary points lie in a convex and compact policy\nsubspace $\\Pi_{\\Delta}$, where the policy value has a constant lower bound\n$\\Delta>0$ and thus the gradient becomes bounded and Lipschitz continuous.\nExperimental results also demonstrate that our 0-FW algorithm is more effective\nthan the

These candidates are generated by an LLM through the expansion of a\nset of seed prompts and are subsequently evaluated using an Upper Confidence\nBound (UCB) acquisition function in conjunction with the GP posterior. The\noptimization process iteratively refines the prompts based on a subset of the\ndata, aiming to improve classification accuracy while reducing the number of\nAPI calls by leveraging the prediction uncertainty of the LLM-based GP. The\nproposed BO-LLM algorithm is evaluated on two datasets, and its advantages are\ndiscussed in detail in this paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc2fc \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(Bayesian Optimization, BO)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(Gaussian Process, GP)\ub97c \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uba70, \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\uace0 UCB \ud68d\ub4dd \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c BO-LLM \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\ub2a5 \ubc0f \uc774\uc810\uc774 \ub17c\uc758\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 GP\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 API \ud638\ucd9c \uc218\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(BO)\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00\ub85c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 BO\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(GP)\ub97c \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uc2dc\ub4dc \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ud6c4 GP \ud6c4\ubc29 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 UCB \ud68d\ub4dd \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 LLM \uae30\ubc18 GP\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec API \ud638\ucd9c \uc218\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c BO-LLM \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8 \uc774\uc810\uc774 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc138\ud788 \ub17c\uc758\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning\n(NSRL) addresses this challenge by training agents to adapt rapidly to\nsequences of distinct Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, existing NSRL\napproaches often focus on tasks with regularly evolving patterns, leading to\nlimited adaptability in highly dynamic settings. Inspired by the success of\nWavelet analysis in time series modeling, specifically its ability to capture\nsignal trends at multiple scales, we propose WISDOM to leverage wavelet-domain\npredictive task representations to enhance NSRL. WISDOM captures these\nmulti-scale features in evolving MDP sequences by transforming task\nrepresentation sequences into the wavelet domain, where wavelet coefficients\nrepresent both global trends and fine-grained variations of non-stationary\nchanges. In addition to the auto-regressive modeling commonly employed in time\nseries forecasting, we devise a wavelet temporal difference (TD) update\noperator to enhance tracking and prediction of MDP evolution. We theoretically\nprove the convergence of this operator and demonstrate policy improvement with\nwavelet task representations.

While classical\ninterpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent\nfindings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves\nto access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis\nto explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we\nassessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed\nimagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups\nshowed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected\ninfluence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs\nshowed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures\nunder different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these\nresults indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents.\nOverall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated\nrepresentations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like\nimagination in artificial intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc774 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ud574\uc11d\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0dd\ud568\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud568.", "result": "\uc778\uac04 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc911\uc2ec\uc131 \uce21\uc815 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uad70\uc9d1\ud654 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "\uc778\uac04\uacfc LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc77c\uae4c? \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uc11d\uc740 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc774 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacac\ud574\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc774 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378(IWM)\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 IWM\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0dd\ud568\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc608\uc0c1 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825, \uac15\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uadfc\uc811\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc911\uc2ec\uc131 \uce21\uc815 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LLM\uc758 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uad70\uc9d1\ud654 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \ub2e4\ub978 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ub300\ud654 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc2ec\uc131 \uce21\uc815 \uac04\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 IWM\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc AI\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Since these applications often demand real-time processing of\nmassive visual data, reducing the inference cost of vision encoders is\ncritical. Post-training quantization offers a practical path, but remains\nchallenging even at 8-bit precision due to massive-scale activations (i.e.,\noutliers). In this work, we propose $\\textit{RegCache}$, a training-free\nalgorithm to mitigate outliers in vision encoders, enabling quantization with\nsignificantly smaller accuracy drops. The proposed RegCache introduces\noutlier-prone yet semantically meaningless prefix tokens to the target vision\nencoder, which prevents other tokens from having outliers. Notably, we observe\nthat outliers in vision encoders behave differently from those in language\nmodels, motivating two technical innovations: middle-layer prefixing and token\ndeletion.

We formalize\nthis with a five-axis decomposition and a decision layer, separating incentives\nfrom learning behavior and analyzing axes in isolation. Our central result\nidentifies and introduces a sharp utility--learning tension, the structural\nconflict in self-modifying systems whereby utility-driven changes that improve\nimmediate or expected performance can also erode the statistical preconditions\nfor reliable learning and generalization. Our findings show that\ndistribution-free guarantees are preserved iff the policy-reachable model\nfamily is uniformly capacity-bounded; when capacity can grow without limit,\nutility-rational self-changes can render learnable tasks unlearnable. Under\nstandard assumptions common in practice, these axes reduce to the same capacity\ncriterion, yielding a single boundary for safe self-modification. Numerical\nexperiments across several axes validate the theory by comparing destructive\nutility policies against our proposed two-gate policies that preserve\nlearnability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc6a9\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5 \uac04\uc758 \uae34\uc7a5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc790\uac00 \uc218\uc815\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ucd08\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac10\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc804\uc81c\uac00 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "5\ucd95 \ubd84\ud574\uc640 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c\uc640 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ucd95\uc744 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc989\uac01\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc608\uc0c1 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc804\uc81c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc57d\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud45c\uc900 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5d0 \uc774 \ucd95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc6a9\uc801 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ucd95\uc18c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc790\uac00 \uc218\uc815\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ucd08\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac10\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc804\uc81c\uac00 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \ub2e4\uc12f \ucd95 \ubd84\ud574\uc640 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacc4\uce35\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c\uc640 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \ucd95\uc744 \uace0\ub9bd\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0-\ud559\uc2b5 \uae34\uc7a5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc218\uc815 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \ub54c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc804\uc81c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc57d\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc790\uc720 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ub418\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \ub3c4\ub2ec \uac00\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc871\uc774 \uace0\ub974\uac8c \uc6a9\uc801 \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6a9\uc801\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c \uc5c6\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c, \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uac00 \ubcc0\ud654\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ubb34\uc5d0\uc11c \ud754\ud788 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5d0 \uc774 \ucd95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc6a9\uc801 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ucd95\uc18c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc790\uac00 \uc218\uc815\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd95\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud30c\uad34\uc801\uc778 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc81c\uc548\uc758 \ub450 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

However, these models suffer from overthinking, generating\nunnecessarily long and redundant reasoning even for simple questions, which\nsubstantially increases computational cost and response latency. While existing\nmethods incorporate length rewards to GRPO to promote concise reasoning, they\nincur significant performance degradation. We identify the root cause: when\nrewards for correct but long rollouts are penalized, GRPO's group-relative\nadvantage function can assign them negative advantages, actively discouraging\nvalid reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy\nOptimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning\nsignal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones. DRPO ensures that reward\nsignals for correct rollouts are normalized solely within the positive group,\nshielding them from interference by negative samples. The DRPO's objective is\ngrounded in integrating an optimized positive data distribution, which\nmaximizes length-based rewards under a KL regularization, into a discriminative\nobjective. We derive a closed-form solution for this distribution, enabling\nefficient computation of the objective and its gradients using only on-policy\ndata and importance weighting.

Prior\napproaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops\ndomain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where\niterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory\nintroduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context\nEngineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that\naccumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of\ngeneration, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured,\nincremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with\nlong-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes\ncontexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory),\nconsistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on\nfinance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost.\nNotably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by\nleveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches\nthe top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it\non the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model.\nThese results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable,\nefficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACE\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ubd81\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc801\uc751\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "ACE\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131, \ubc18\uc131 \ubc0f \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uba70 \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "ACE\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c offline \ubc0f online\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ACE\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc801\uc751\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uac04\uacb0\ud55c \uc694\uc57d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uc9e7\uc74c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uacfc \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uc7ac\uc791\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\ubd80 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \uc18c\uc2e4\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5 \ubd95\uad34 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While replacing its non-robust statistics with robust counterparts\n(termed R$^2$-IN) seems like a straightforward improvement, our findings reveal\na far more complex reality. This paper deconstructs the perplexing performance\nof various normalization strategies by identifying four underlying theoretical\ncontradictions. Our experiments provide two crucial findings: first, the\nstandard RevIN catastrophically fails on datasets with extreme outliers, where\nits MSE surges by a staggering 683\\%. Second, while the simple R$^2$-IN\nprevents this failure and unexpectedly emerges as the best overall performer,\nour adaptive model (A-IN), designed to test a diagnostics-driven heuristic,\nunexpectedly suffers a complete and systemic failure. This surprising outcome\nuncovers a critical, overlooked pitfall in time series analysis: the\ninstability introduced by a simple or counter-intuitive heuristic can be more\ndamaging than the statistical issues it aims to solve. The core contribution of\nthis work is thus a new, cautionary paradigm for time series normalization: a\nshift from a blind search for complexity to a diagnostics-driven analysis that\nreveals not

Small shifts in user behavior, such as being more\nimpatient, incoherent, or skeptical, can cause sharp drops in agent\nperformance, revealing how brittle current AI agents are. Today's benchmarks\nfail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard\nevaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We\naddress this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,\nmodel-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis\nlearns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits\n(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,\nand applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using\nTraitBasis, we extend $\\tau$-Bench to $\\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are\naltered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30%\nperformance degradation on $\\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting\nthe lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.\nTogether, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing\nand the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional\ntool. By powering simulation-driven stress tests and training loops, TraitBasis\nopens the door to building AI agents that remain reliable in the unpredictable\ndynamics of real-world human interactions. We have open-sourced $\\tau$-Trai\nacross four domains: airline, retail, telecom, and telehealth, so the community\ncan systematically QA their agents under realistic, behaviorally diverse\nintents and trait scenarios: https://github.com/collinear-ai/tau-trait.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub300\ud654 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uba70 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc800\ud558\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.

Due to the aleatoric nature of the sequential optimization\nproblem and its dependence on the quality of the surrogate model and the\ninitial design, it is restrictive to assume that all observed samples\ncontribute equally to the discovery of the optimum in this context. In this\npaper, we introduce Counterfactual Credit Guided Bayesian Optimization (CCGBO),\na novel framework that explicitly quantifies the contribution of individual\nhistorical observations through counterfactual credit.

Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively\ndecomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts\nwith chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations,\ncropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing\naxes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask.\nThis iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for\nchart comprehension. ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the\nChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07%\nabsolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries.\nFurthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse\nchart types, (b) achieve the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning\ncomplexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts\nperformance across diverse underlying LLMs. Our work is among the first to\ndemonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using\ntool-augmented multimodal agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChartAgent\ub294 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ucc28\ud2b8\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \uc601\uc5ed \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec LLM\uc774 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucc28\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uae09\ub77d\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "ChartAgent\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\uc11d \ucd94\uac00, \uc601\uc5ed \uc790\ub974\uae30 \ubc0f \ucd95 \uc704\uce58 \uc9c0\uc815\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ChartAgent\ub294 ChartBench\uc640 ChartX \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 16.07%\uc758 \uc808\ub300 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc 17.31%\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ChartAgent\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc2dc\uac01 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\ubcf8 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec LLM\uc740 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub2e8\ucd95\ud0a4\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucc28\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ChartAgent\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ucc28\ud2b8\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \uc601\uc5ed \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc8fc\uc11d \ucd94\uac00, \uc601\uc5ed \uc790\ub974\uae30(\uc608: \ud30c\uc774 \uc870\uac01 \ubd84\ud560, \ub9c9\ub300 \uaca9\ub9ac) \ubc0f \ucd95 \uc704\uce58 \uc9c0\uc815\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc791\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing approaches for the SEA model\nrequire prior knowledge of problem-specific parameters, such as the diameter of\nthe domain $D$ and the Lipschitz constant of the loss functions $G$, which\nlimits their practical applicability. Addressing this, we develop\nparameter-free methods by leveraging the Optimistic Online Newton Step (OONS)\nalgorithm to eliminate the need for these parameters.

Fixed-Point Theorems for Credal Set Updates", "comment": null, "summary": "Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty\nrepresentations, ranging from variational inference and\nexpectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and\nmulti-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets\n-- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a\npopular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such\nimprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning\n(IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update\nrules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this\niterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under\nwhat conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether\nthey can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem and\nillustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete\nexample. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning\nprocess not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals\nstructural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new\ninsights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uace0\uc815\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud06c\ub808\ub2ec \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uae30\uacc4\ud559\uc2b5(IPML)\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud06c\ub808\ub2ec \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec, \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0 \uace0\uc815\uc810\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\ub2ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba74, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud574\uc9c8 \ubfd0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uc5b4 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ubcc0\ubcc4 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uae30\ub300-\ucd5c\ub300\ud654, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5, \uc9c0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0, \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub418\uace0 \ubcfc\ub85d\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569\uc778 \ud06c\ub808\ub2ec \uc9d1\ud569\uc774 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud655\ub960 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd80\uc815\ud655\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c, \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(IPML)\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ud06c\ub808\ub2ec \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc774 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uac00 \uc548\uc815\ub41c \uace0\uc815\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294\uc9c0, \ub610\ub294 \ub354 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uace0\uc815\uc810\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uadf8\uac83\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc9c8\ubb38\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc608\ub85c \ud06c\ub808\ub2ec \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ubc1d\ud788\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uc5b4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, whether planning is causally driven by this\nreasoning remains a critical but unverified assumption. To investigate this, we\nbuild DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus\nwith plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT), automatically generated from nuPlan.\nOur data generation process converts sensors and annotations into structured\ninputs and, crucially, separates priors from to-be-reasoned signals, enabling\nclean information ablations. Using DriveMind, we train representative VLM\nagents with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) and evaluate them with nuPlan's metrics. Our results, unfortunately,\nindicate a consistent causal disconnect in reasoning-planning: removing\nego/navigation priors causes large drops in planning scores, whereas removing\nCoT produces only minor changes. Attention analysis further shows that planning\nprimarily focuses on priors rather than the CoT. Based on this evidence, we\npropose the Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis, positing that the\ntraining-yielded reasoning is an ancillary byproduct rather than a causal\nmediator. To enable efficient diagnosis, we also introduce a novel,\ntraining-free probe that measures an agent's reliance on priors by evaluating\nits planning robustness against minor input perturbations.

Can a model do the same? We propose an agent that\nassembles a task-specific curriculum, called test-time curriculum (TTC-RL), and\napplies reinforcement learning to continue training the model for its target\ntask. The test-time curriculum avoids time-consuming human curation of datasets\nby automatically selecting the most task-relevant data from a large pool of\navailable training data. Our experiments demonstrate that reinforcement\nlearning on a test-time curriculum consistently improves the model on its\ntarget tasks, across a variety of evaluations and models. Notably, on\nchallenging math and coding benchmarks, TTC-RL improves the pass@1 of Qwen3-8B\nby approximately 1.8x on AIME25 and 2.1x on CodeElo. Moreover, we find that\nTTC-RL significantly raises the performance ceiling compared to the initial\nmodel, increasing pass@8 on AIME25 from 40% to 62% and on CodeElo from 28% to\n43%. Our findings show the potential of test-time curricula in extending the\ntest-time scaling paradigm to continual training on thousands of task-relevant\nexperiences during test-time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc(TTC-RL)\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad50\uc721 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uc740 \uc9c1\ubb34 \uc218\ud589 \uc911\uc5d0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b4\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \ub610\ud55c \uc774\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c\uc9c0 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "TTC-RL\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud070 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud480\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TTC-RL\uc740 Qwen3-8B\uc758 AIME25\uc5d0\uc11c pass@1\uc744 \uc57d 1.8\ubc30 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, CodeElo\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 2.1\ubc30 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

It\nrelies on the model's implicit fragile pattern-matching capabilities, leading\nto frequent illegal moves and strategically shallow play. Here we introduce an\nalternative approach: We use the LLM to translate natural language rules and\ngame trajectories into a formal, executable world model represented as Python\ncode. This generated model -- comprising functions for state transition, legal\nmove enumeration, and termination checks -- serves as a verifiable simulation\nengine for high-performance planning algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search\n(MCTS). In addition, we prompt the LLM to generate heuristic value functions\n(to make MCTS more efficient), and inference functions (to estimate hidden\nstates in imperfect information games). Our method offers three distinct\nadvantages compared to directly using the LLM as a policy: (1) Verifiability:\nThe generated CWM serves as a formal specification of the game's rules,\nallowing planners to algorithmically enumerate valid actions and avoid illegal\nmoves, contingent on the correctness of the synthesized model; (2) Strategic\nDepth: We combine LLM semantic understanding with the deep search power of\nclassical planners; and (3) Generalization: We direct the LLM to focus on the\nmeta-task of data-to-code translation, enabling it to adapt to new games more\neasily. We evaluate our agent on 10 different games, of which 4 are novel and\ncreated for this paper. 5 of the games are fully observed (perfect\ninformation), and 5 are partially observed (imperfect information). We find\nthat our method outperforms or matches Gemini 2.5 Pro in 9 out of the 10\nconsidered games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744

A key challenge is generating\nCEs that are robust against various perturbation types (e.g. input and model\nperturbations) while simultaneously satisfying other desirable properties.\nThese include plausibility, ensuring CEs reside on the data manifold, and\ndiversity, providing multiple distinct recourse options for single inputs.\nExisting methods, however, mostly struggle to address these multifaceted\nrequirements in a unified, model-agnostic manner. We address these limitations\nby proposing a novel generative framework. First, we introduce the\nLabel-conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (L-GMVAE), a model\ntrained to learn a structured latent space where each class label is\nrepresented by a set of Gaussian components with diverse, prototypical\ncentroids. Building on this, we present LAPACE (LAtent PAth Counterfactual\nExplanations), a model-agnostic algorithm that synthesises entire paths of CE\npoints by interpolating from inputs' latent representations to those learned\nlatent centroids. This approach inherently ensures robustness to input changes,\nas all paths for a given target class converge to the same fixed centroids.\nFurthermore, the generated paths provide a spectrum of recourse options,\nallowing users to navigate the trade-off between proximity and plausibility\nwhile also encouraging robustness against model changes. In addition,\nuser-specified actionability constraints can also be easily incorporated via\nlightweight gradient optimisation through the L-GMVAE's decoder. Comprehensive\nexperiments show that LAPACE is computationally efficient and achieves\ncompetitive performance across eight quantitative metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use\ncapability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed\ntool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and\nordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to\ncomprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with\nfine-grained evaluation metrics.

Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises\nwhen continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints\nestablished during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies.\nWe formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms:\nSelf-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce\nindividual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant\nbehaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we\nconstruct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode\nrapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward\nunaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse\nquickly, leading to collective misalignment. Moreover, current reinforcement\nlearning-based alignment methods provide only fragile defenses against\nalignment tipping. Together, these findings demonstrate that alignment of LLM\nagents is not a static property but a fragile and dynamic one, vulnerable to\nfeedback-driven decay during deployment.

To address these limitations, we propose ContextNav, the first\nagentic framework that integrates the scalability of automated retrieval with\nthe quality and adaptiveness of human-like curation, enabling noise-robust and\ndynamically optimized contextualization for multimodal ICL. ContextNav unifies\ncontext management and noise-robust contextualization within a closed-loop\nworkflow driven by graph-based orchestration.

Common workarounds either shrink the input via retrieval (risking\nmissed evidence), enlarge the context window (straining selectivity), or stage\nmultiple agents to read in pieces. In staged pipelines (e.g., Chain of Agents,\nCoA), free-form summaries passed between agents can discard crucial details and\namplify early mistakes. We introduce COSMIR (Chain Orchestrated Structured\nMemory for Iterative Reasoning), a chain-style framework that replaces ad hoc\nmessages with a structured memory. A Planner agent first turns a user query\ninto concrete, checkable sub-questions. worker agents process chunks via a\nfixed micro-cycle: Extract, Infer, Refine, writing all updates to the shared\nmemory.

As AI\nsystems increasingly mimic human behavior and interaction with high fidelity,\nthe concept of a \"perfect mimic\"-an entity empirically indistinguishable from a\nhuman through observation and interaction-shifts from hypothetical to\ntechnologically plausible. This paper argues that such developments pose a\nfundamental challenge to the consistency of our mind-recognition practices.\nConsciousness attributions rely heavily, if not exclusively, on empirical\nevidence derived from behavior and interaction. If a perfect mimic provides\nevidence identical to that of humans, any refusal to grant it equivalent\nepistemic status must invoke inaccessible factors, such as qualia, substrate\nrequirements, or origin. Selectively invoking such factors risks a debilitating\ndilemma: either we undermine the rational basis for attributing consciousness\nto others (epistemological solipsism), or we accept inconsistent reasoning.

However,\nthey often require approximating a different posterior distribution in\ndifferent round of the bandit problem. This requires tricky, round-specific\ntuning of hyperparameters such as dynamic learning rates, causing challenges in\nboth theoretical analysis and practical implementation. To alleviate this\nnon-stationarity, we introduce TS-SA, which incorporates stochastic\napproximation (SA) within the TS framework. In each round, TS-SA constructs a\nposterior approximation only using the most recent reward(s), performs a\nLangevin Monte Carlo (LMC) update, and applies an SA step to average noisy\nproposals over time. This can be interpreted as approximating a stationary\nposterior target throughout the entire algorithm, which further yields a fixed\nstep-size, a unified convergence analysis framework, and improved posterior\nestimates through temporal averaging. We establish near-optimal regret bounds\nfor TS-SA, with a simplified and more intuitive theoretical analysis enabled by\ninterpreting the entire algorithm as a simulation of a stationary SGLD process.\nOur empirical results demonstrate that even a single-step Langevin update with\ncertain warm-up outperforms existing methods substantially on bandit tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 TS-SA\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5 \ub3c4\ubc15\ub300 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\uc815 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac \ud0d0\uc2a8 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uc561\uc131 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac01 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud574\uc57c \ud574\uc11c \uace0\uc720\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "TS-SA\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\ud6c4 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \ub791\uc8fc\ubc45 \ubaac\ud14c \uce74\ub97c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, SA \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc81c\uc548\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TS-SA\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc2a4\ud15d \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc218\ub834 \ubd84\uc11d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0, \uc2dc\uac04 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TS-SA\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd5c\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc804\uccb4\ub97c \uc815\uc801 SGLD \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub860 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uadfc\uc0ac \ud0d0\uc2a8 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uac01 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9ac\uc5b4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub791\uc8fc\ubc45 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559(SGLD) \ub610\ub294 \uadf8 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc77c\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc2a8 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uc561\uc131 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub4e4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub3c4\ubc15 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uac01 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9ac\uc5b4 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \ub3d9\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\ubcc4 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TS-SA\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec TS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uadfc\uc0ac(SA)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.

To address this challenge,\nwe propose the AdaR framework to enable adaptive reasoning, wherein models rely\non problem-solving logic to produce answers. AdaR synthesizes logically\nequivalent queries by varying variable values, and trains models with RLVR on\nthese data to penalize spurious logic while encouraging adaptive logic. To\nimprove data quality, we extract the problem-solving logic from the original\nquery and generate the corresponding answer by code execution, then apply a\nsanity check. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaR improves robustness\nand generalization, achieving substantial improvement in mathematical reasoning\nwhile maintaining high data efficiency. Analysis indicates that data synthesis\nand RLVR function in a coordinated manner to enable adaptive reasoning in LLMs.\nSubsequent analyses derive key design insights into the effect of critical\nfactors and the applicability to instruct LLMs. Our project is available at\nhttps://github.com/LaiZhejian/AdaR", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AdaR \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd80\uc871\uc740 \ud45c\uba74\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uae30\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AdaR \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcc0\uc218 \uac12\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uace0, RLVR\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ud398\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uba70 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc7a5\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, AdaR\uc774 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131\uacfc RLVR\uc774 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uc640 LLM \uad50\uc721\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc124\uacc4 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 LLM\uc740 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \ud45c\uba74\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2f5\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\ub294 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uae30\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 AdaR \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While current LLM-based agent models demonstrate\ncompetitive performance, they still exhibit significant deviations from\nreal-world fund companies. A critical distinction lies in the agents' reliance\non ``post-reflection'', particularly in response to adverse outcomes, but lack\na distinctly human capability: long-term prediction of future trends.\nTherefore, we introduce QuantAgents, a multi-agent system integrating simulated\ntrading, to comprehensively evaluate various investment strategies and market\nscenarios without assuming actual risks. Specifically, QuantAgents comprises\nfour agents: a simulated trading analyst, a risk control analyst, a market news\nanalyst, and a manager, who collaborate through several meetings. Moreover, our\nsystem incentivizes agents to receive feedback on two fronts: performance in\nreal-world markets and predictive accuracy in simulated trading. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our framework excels across all metrics, yielding\nan overall return of nearly 300% over the three years\n(https://quantagents.github.io/).", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae08\uc735 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 QuantAgents\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud22c\uc790 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \ud380\ub4dc \ud68c\uc0ac\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "method": "QuantAgents\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uac70\ub798 \ubd84\uc11d\uac00, \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac \ubd84\uc11d\uac00, \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ub274\uc2a4 \ubd84\uc11d\uac00, \uad00\ub9ac\uc790 \ub4f1 \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud68c\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, 3\ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uac70\uc758 300%\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc218\uc775\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "QuantAgents\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud22c\uc790 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae08\uc735 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubc95\uc778 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae08\uc735 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e4\uc81c \ud380\ub4dc \ud68c\uc0ac\uc640\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ucc28\uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uc751\uc73c\ub85c '\uc0ac\ud6c4 \ubc18\uc131'\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubbf8\ub798 \ud2b8\ub80c\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc778\uac04\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud22c\uc790 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 QuantAgents\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, QuantAgents\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uac70\ub798 \ubd84\uc11d\uac00, \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac \ubd84\uc11d\uac00, \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ub274\uc2a4 \ubd84\uc11d\uac00 \ubc0f \uad00\ub9ac\uc790 \ub4f1 \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uba70 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud68c\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\uc640 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uac70\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ub450 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, 3\ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uac70\uc758 300%\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc218\uc775\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4."}}

To address these limitations, we introduce Watch & Learn\n(W&L), a framework that converts human demonstration videos readily available\non the Internet into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly\ngenerating trajectories or relying on ad hoc reasoning heuristics, we cast the\nproblem as an inverse dynamics objective: predicting the user's action from\nconsecutive screen states. This formulation reduces manual engineering, is\neasier to learn, and generalizes more robustly across applications. Concretely,\nwe develop an inverse dynamics labeling pipeline with task-aware video\nretrieval, generate over 53k high-quality trajectories from raw web videos, and\ndemonstrate that these trajectories improve CUAs both as in-context\ndemonstrations and as supervised training data. On the challenging OSWorld\nbenchmark, UI trajectories extracted with W&L consistently enhance both\ngeneral-purpose and state-of-the-art frameworks in-context, and deliver\nstronger gains for open-source models under supervised training.

Recent work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for\ntraining search-augmented agents that interleave reasoning and retrieval before\nanswering. These approaches usually rely on outcome-based rewards (e.g., exact\nmatch), implicitly assuming that optimizing for final answers will also yield\neffective intermediate search behaviors. Our analysis challenges this\nassumption: we uncover multiple systematic deficiencies in search that arise\nunder outcome-only training and ultimately degrade final answer quality,\nincluding failure to invoke tools, invalid queries, and redundant searches. To\naddress these shortcomings, we introduce DeSA (Decoupling\nSearch-and-Answering), a simple two-stage training framework that explicitly\nseparates search optimization from answer generation. In Stage 1, agents are\ntrained to improve search effectiveness with retrieval recall-based rewards. In\nStage 2, outcome rewards are employed to optimize final answer generation.\nAcross seven QA benchmarks, DeSA-trained agents consistently improve search\nbehaviors, delivering substantially higher search recall and answer accuracy\nthan outcome-only baselines. Notably, DeSA outperforms single-stage training\napproaches that simultaneously optimize recall and outcome rewards,\nunderscoring the necessity of explicitly decoupling the two objectives.", "AI":

At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and\nsycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect\nmathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the\napplicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed\nproofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing\nbenchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus\nsolely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated\ndatasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that\ncreate ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are\ndemonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first\nbenchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of\nnatural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025\ncompetition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false\nstatements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an\nLLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems\nand find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing\nsycophantic answers 29% of the time.

By leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence\ntechnologies, Web 3.0 offers unprecedented opportunities for users to create,\nown, and monetize their content, thereby enabling User-Generated Content (UGC)\nto an entirely new level. However, some self-interested users may exploit the\nlimitations of content curation mechanisms and generate low-quality content\nwith less effort, obtaining platform rewards under information asymmetry. Such\nbehavior can undermine Web 3.0 performance. To this end, we propose\n\\textit{LMM-Incentive}, a novel Large Multimodal Model (LMM)-based incentive\nmechanism for UGC in Web 3.0. Specifically, we propose an LMM-based\ncontract-theoretic model to motivate users to generate high-quality UGC,\nthereby mitigating the adverse selection problem from information asymmetry. To\nalleviate potential moral hazards after contract selection, we leverage LMM\nagents to evaluate UGC quality, which is the primary component of the contract,\nutilizing prompt engineering techniques to improve the evaluation performance\nof LMM agents. Recognizing that traditional contract design methods cannot\neffectively adapt to the dynamic environment of Web 3.0, we develop an improved\nMixture of Experts (MoE)-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for\noptimal contract design. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed MoE-based PPO algorithm over representative benchmarks in the context\nof contract design. Finally, we deploy the designed contract within an Ethereum\nsmart contract framework, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed\nscheme.", "AI": {"tldr": "Web 3.0\uc5d0\uc11c UGC

While Detailed Balance (DB) addresses\nlocal optimization more effectively, it alone falls short in solving VRPs,\nwhich inherently require holistic trajectory optimization. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce the Hybrid-Balance GFlowNet (HBG) framework, which\nuniquely integrates TB and DB in a principled and adaptive manner by aligning\ntheir intrinsically complementary strengths. Additionally, we propose a\nspecialized inference strategy for depot-centric scenarios like the Capacitated\nVehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), leveraging the depot node's greater flexibility\nin selecting successors. Despite this specialization, HBG maintains broad\napplicability, extending effectively to problems without explicit depots, such\nas the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

Furthermore, these models\nface challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing\nenvironments due to the static nature of their pretraining data. To address\nthese issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning\ntasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate\ncognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic. This paper\nintroduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless\nintegration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate\nreasoning within LLMs. MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools,\nsuch as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access\nup-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a\nspecialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and\nsummarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that\nexpand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity.\nFurthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework\nextending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both\nsystems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample\nbalancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the\nchallenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9%\nacross 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our\ndual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARS\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c 1\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c 2\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LRM\uc758 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uacbd\ud5a5\uacfc \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MARS\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c 1\uc758 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c 2\uc758 \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MARS\ub294 Humanity's Last Exam \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c 3.86%\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, 7\uac1c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 8.9%\uc758 \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MARS\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRM)\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c 2 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae09\ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc778\uc9c0\uc758 \uc774\uc911 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub3d9\uc801\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c 1\uc758 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c 2\uc758 \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 MARS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

The architecture comprises a\nhigh-level planner, a reinforcement learning execution agent, and an\nindependent compliance agent. We formulate trade execution as a constrained\nMarkov decision process with hard constraints on participation limits, price\nbands, and self-trading avoidance. The execution agent is trained with proximal\npolicy optimization, while a runtime action-shield projects any unsafe action\ninto a feasible set. To support auditability without exposing proprietary\nsignals, we add a zero-knowledge compliance audit layer that produces\ncryptographic proofs that all actions satisfied the constraints. We evaluate in\na multi-venue, ABIDES-based simulator and compare against standard baselines\n(e.g., TWAP, VWAP). The learned policy reduces implementation shortfall and\nvariance while exhibiting no observed constraint violations across stress\nscenarios including elevated latency, partial fills, compliance module\ntoggling, and varying constraint limits. We report effects at the 95%\nconfidence level using paired t-tests and examine tail risk via CVaR.

While\nrecent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at logical inference, their ability\nto infer rationale in dynamic, collaborative settings remains under-explored.\nThis study introduces LLM-Hanabi, a novel benchmark that uses the cooperative\ngame Hanabi to evaluate the rationale inference and ToM of LLMs. Our framework\nfeatures an automated evaluation system that measures both game performance and\nToM proficiency. Across a range of models, we find a significant positive\ncorrelation between ToM and in-game success. Notably, first-order ToM\n(interpreting others' intent) correlates more strongly with performance than\nsecond-order ToM (predicting others' interpretations). These findings highlight\nthat for effective AI collaboration, the ability to accurately interpret a\npartner's rationale is more critical than higher-order reasoning.

While recent\nstudies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such\ntasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative\ncapacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as\ninstructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired\nby the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general\nThink-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an\nembedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain\ncomplex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations\nconditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This\nexplicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex\nmultimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold.

However, it requires an explicit environment model, often\nunavailable or overly complex in real-world scenarios. While MuZero enables\neffective model learning for search in perfect information games, extending\nthis paradigm to imperfect information games presents substantial challenges\ndue to more nuanced look-ahead reasoning techniques and large number of states\nrelevant for individual decisions. This paper introduces an algorithm LAMIR\nthat learns an abstracted model of an imperfect information game directly from\nthe agent-environment interaction. During test time, this trained model is used\nto perform look-ahead reasoning. The learned abstraction limits the size of\neach subgame to a manageable size, making theoretically principled look-ahead\nreasoning tractable even in games where previous methods could not scale.

While\nmulti-agent inference can enhance response quality, it can significantly\nincrease the time to first token (TTFT), posing a challenge for\nlatency-sensitive applications and hurting user experience. To address this\nissue, we propose staircase streaming for low-latency multi-agent inference.\nInstead of waiting for the complete intermediate outputs from previous steps,\nwe begin generating the final response as soon as we receive partial outputs\nfrom these steps. Experimental results demonstrate that staircase streaming\nreduces TTFT by up to 93% while maintaining response quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\ub2e8\uc2dd \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc911\uac04 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uae30\ub2e4\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \ubd80\ubd84 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \uc989\uc2dc \ucd5c\uc885 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \uc751\ub2f5 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uccab \ud1a0\ud070\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 93% \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc751\ub2f5 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc TTFT\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacc4\ub2e8\uc2dd \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uac04 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uae30\ub2e4\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubd80\ubd84\ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \uc989\uc2dc \ucd5c\uc885 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uacc4\ub2e8\uc2dd \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d\uc774 TTFT\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 93% \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc751\ub2f5 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacc4\ub2e8\uc2dd \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d\uc740 \ub0ae\uc740 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud63c\ud569(Mixture-of-Agents),\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc885 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc911\uac04 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uac00 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uccab \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04(TTFT)\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc5d0 \uc545\uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\ub2e8\uc2dd \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uae30\ub2e4\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubd80\ubd84 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \uc989\uc2dc \ucd5c\uc885 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uacc4\ub2e8\uc2dd \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d\uc774 \uc751\ub2f5 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c TTFT\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 93%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
