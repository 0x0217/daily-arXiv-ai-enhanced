This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc885\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc6b4\uc601\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uadf8 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "JailbreakBench\uc758 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc8fc\uc694 LLM \uacc4\uc5f4\uacfc \uaddc\ubaa8(0.6B-120B \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218)\uc5d0\uc11c 6,000\uac74 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790-\ub300\uc0c1 \uad50\ud658\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0, \uc704\ud5d8 \uc810\uc218\uc640 \uac70\uc808 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uacfc \uc815\ub82c \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc758 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud3c9\uade0 \uc704\ud5d8\uacfc \uacf5\uaca9\uc790-\ub300\uc0c1 \ud06c\uae30 \ube44\uc728\uc758 \ub85c\uadf8 \uac04\uc5d0 \uac15\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70(Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), \uc774\ub294 \uc0c1\ub300 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \uc720\ud574\ud55c \uc644\uc131\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc2ec\uac01\uc131\uacfc \uc5f0\uad00\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ud06c\uae30 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc774 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801\uc778 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc885\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0, \uc989 \uc815\ub82c \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uc720\ud574\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.

AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.\n  The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.\n  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode.

Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator.

During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "DataSage\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac80\uc0c9, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5ed\ud560 \ud1a0\ub860 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \ub2e4\uc911 \uacbd\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DataSage\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac80\uc0c9, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5ed\ud560 \ud1a0\ub860 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \ub2e4\uc911 \uacbd\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "InsightBench\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 DataSage\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DataSage\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ub298\ub0a0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc870\uc9c1\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud575\uc2ec \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc774\uc720\ub85c \ub9cc\uc871\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9 \ubd80\uc871, (2) \uc595\uc740 \ubd84\uc11d \uae4a\uc774, (3) \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc911 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\uc11d \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac80\uc0c9, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d \uae4a\uc774\ub97c \uc2ec\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5ed\ud560 \ud1a0\ub860 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ucf54\ub4dc\uc640 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uacbd\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 DataSage\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Engelstad"], "title": "Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting of non-parametric CDFs with Deep Lattice Networks", "comment": null, "summary": "Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach.

However, they also amplify the risks of malicious misuse cases such as unauthorized collection of personally identifiable information (PII), generation of socially divisive content, and even automated web hacking. To address these threats, we propose an AI Kill Switch technique that can immediately halt the operation of malicious web-based LLM agents. To achieve this, we introduce AutoGuard - the key idea is generating defensive prompts that trigger the safety mechanisms of malicious LLM agents. In particular, generated defense prompts are transparently embedded into the website's DOM so that they remain invisible to human users but can be detected by the crawling process of malicious agents, triggering its internal safety mechanisms to abort malicious actions once read. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a dedicated benchmark consisting of three representative malicious scenarios (PII collection, social rift content generation, and web hacking attempts). Experimental results show that the AutoGuard method achieves over 80% Defense Success Rate (DSR) on malicious agents, including GPT-4o, Claude-3, and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. It also maintains strong performance, achieving around 90% DSR on GPT-5, GPT-4.1, and Gemini-2.5-Flash when used as the malicious agent, demonstrating robust generalization across models and scenarios. Through this research, we have demonstrated the controllability of web-based LLM agents across various scenarios and models, thereby contributing to the broader effort of AI control and safety.",

However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uace0\uae09

To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models", "AI": {"tldr":

While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, many operate as black boxes, lacking transparency in their decision-making. This paper introduces ExplainableGuard, an interpretable adversarial defense framework leveraging the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-Reasoner. Our approach not only detects and neutralizes adversarial perturbations in text but also provides step-by-step explanations for each defense action. We demonstrate how tailored CoT prompts guide the LLM to perform a multi-faceted analysis (character, word, structural, and semantic) and generate a purified output along with a human-readable justification. Preliminary results on the GLUE Benchmark and IMDB Movie Reviews dataset show promising defense efficacy. Additionally, a human evaluation study reveals that ExplainableGuard's explanations outperform ablated variants in clarity, specificity, and actionability, with a 72.5% deployability-trust rating, underscoring its potential for more trustworthy LLM deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ExplainableGuard\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc870\uc791\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ud070 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "ExplainableGuard\ub294 DeepSeek-Reasoner\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \uccb4\uc778(CoT) \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc12d\ub3d9\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc911\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uac01 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc870\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GLUE \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 IMDB \uc601\ud654 \ub9ac\ubdf0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd08\uae30 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c ExplainableGuard\uc758 \uc124\uba85\uc740 \uba85\ub8cc\uc131, \uad6c\uccb4\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubcc0\ud615\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, 72.5%\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ub4f1\uae09\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc5ec \ub354\uc6b1 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 LLM \ubc30\ud3ec\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ucd9c\ub825\ubb3c\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc791\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ucde8\uc57d\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9ce\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4\ucc98\ub7fc \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 DeepSeek-Reasoner\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \uccb4\uc778(CoT) \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ExplainableGuard\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc12d\ub3d9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc911\ud654\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uac01 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc870\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 CoT \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 LLM\uc774 \ub2e4\uac01\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d(\ubb38\uc790, \ub2e8\uc5b4, \uad6c\uc870\uc801, \uc758\ubbf8\uc801)\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud654\ub41c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.

We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039).

Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.\n  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \ubc0f \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uc218\uc900 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \ucee4\uc84c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 MLIR \ub2e4\uc774\uc5bc\ub809\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec \uc124\uacc4 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uc640 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "MLIR \ub2e4\uc774\uc5bc\ub809\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc218\uc900 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uacfc \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ub098\ub178\ucee4\ub110\uc740 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucee4\ub110 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc640 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0, \uc9c1\uc811 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \ubc0f \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ub113\ud614\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uae4a\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \ucee4\ub110(\uc608: DeepSeek)\uc744 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uac70\ub098 \uc804\ubb38 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac(\uc608: CUTLASS)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub450 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 ML \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ub354\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 MLIR \ub2e4\uc774\uc5bc\ub809\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc218\uc900 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c \uae30\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \ub2e4\ub9ac\ub97c \ub193\uc544 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\uac00 \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc740 \uc800\uc218\uc900 IR \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub098\ub178\ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uc870\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ub808\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud130 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub3c4\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucee4\ub110\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubca1\ud130 \ubc0f \ud0c0\uc77c \uae30\ubc18 CPU \uba85\ub839\uc5b4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 MLIR \uae30\ubc18 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ub098\ub178\ucee4\ub110\uc740 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uace0 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucee4\ub110 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc640 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.\n  To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models.

Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $\u03b2$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets.

To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat

We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.\n  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc74c\uc545 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uad50\uc721\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc640 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uc758 \uc74c\uc545 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uad50\uc721 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc885\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc911 \uc0ac\ub840 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 AI \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc131 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uac8c \uc74c\uc545 \ud328\ud134 \uc778\uc2dd, \uc791\uace1 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654, \uad50\uc721 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucc45\uc784\uac10 \uc788\ub294 AI \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc220\uc801, \uad50\uc721\uc801, \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uce21\uba74\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc74c\uc545 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uad50\uc721\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc640 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc885\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad50\uc721\uc801 \ud568\uc758\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc0ac\ub840 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ubd84\uc11d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ucc3d\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131 AI \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9; (2) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd, \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uae30\ud638 \uc74c\uc545 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc124\uacc4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc74c\uc545 \ud328\ud134 \uc778\uc2dd, \uc791\uace1 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654 \ubc0f \uad50\uc721 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uc9c4\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub0a8\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud22c\uba85\uc131, \ubb38\ud654\uc801 \ud3b8\uacac \ubc0f \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud3c9\uac00 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uc815\uc758\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uad50\uc721 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 AI\uc758 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \ubc30\uce58 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc74c\uc545\ud559 \ubc0f \uc74c\uc545 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc801, \uad50\uc721\uc801, \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uace0\ub824 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.\n  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware.

However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming.

However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation.

Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases.

However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \\emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "STICA\ub294 \uac1d\uccb4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 Transformer\ub97c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ubcf5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc778\uac04\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc774\uc0b0 \uac1d\uccb4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "STICA\ub294 \uac1d\uccb4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070\uc73c\ub85c \uac01 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uac00\uce58 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "STICA\ub294 \uac1d\uccb4\uac00 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ucd5c\uc885 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "STICA\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud658\uacbd \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub2e4\uc911 \uac1d\uccb4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ubcf5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c \uc778\uac04\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc774\uc0b0 \uac1d\uccb4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac1d\uccb4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 Transformer\uac00 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc815\ucc45 \ubc0f \uac00\uce58 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning (STICA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark.

Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc138\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\uc18d \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc555\ucd95 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FlowRoI\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc140 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc800\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uc804\uc1a1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba74\uc5ed \uc138\ud3ec\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \uc774\ub3d9\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \ube68\ub77c \uc800\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uc804\uc1a1\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "FlowRoI\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uac04\uc758 \uad11\ud559 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc138\ud3ec\ub97c \ucee4\ubc84\ud558\ub294 RoI \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec JPEG2000\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc555\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FlowRoI\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \ub178\ud2b8\ubd81\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 30fps\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, PSNR \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 JPEG2000\ubcf4\ub2e4 2.0-2.2\ubc30 \ub192\uc740 \uc555\ucd95\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FlowRoI\ub294 \uba74\uc5ed \uc138\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc800\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uc804\uc1a1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \ub192\uc740 \uc555\ucd95\ub960\uacfc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \uc774\ub3d9\uc740 \ud638\uc911\uad6c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uba74\uc5ed \uc138\ud3ec\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 96\uc6f0 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \ud53c\uce58\uc5d0 \ubc30\uc5f4\ub41c 16\uac1c\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc218\ucc28 \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \uc720\ub9ac \ub80c\uc988\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ub80c\uc988 \ubc30\uc5f4 \ud604\ubbf8\uacbd\uc778 ComplexEye\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc138\ud3ec\uc758 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc601\uc0c1\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uc774\ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\uc18d \uc0dd\uc138\ud3ec \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud604\ubbf8\uacbd\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc6b4\ub3d9\uc758 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 ComplexEye\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uace0\uc18d \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc740 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uc804\uc1a1\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba74\uc5ed \uc138\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc18d \uad11\ud559 \ud750\ub984 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad00\uc2ec \uc601\uc5ed(RoI) \ucd94\ucd9c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FlowRoI\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\\% (single run) to 25\\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \\textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $\u03c1=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($\u03c1=0.41$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 AI \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub9cc \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. 12\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CLEAR\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uacfc\uc81c \uc644\ub8cc \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub9cc \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \uc6b4\uc601 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\uc5c5 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "12\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2e4\uc99d \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc815\ud655\uc131\ub9cc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc778\uc2dd \ub300\uc548\ubcf4\ub2e4 4.4-10.8\ubc30 \ub354 \ube44\uc2fc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CLEAR\ub294 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc608\uce21\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\uc5c5 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc740 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 12\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 50\ubc30\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac, (2) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 60% (\ub2e8\uc77c \uc2e4\ud589)\uc5d0\uc11c 25% (8\ud68c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc77c\uad00\uc131)\ub85c \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00, (3) \ubcf4\uc548, \ub808\uc774\ud134\uc2dc \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc758 \uacb0\uc5ec. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CLEAR(\ube44\uc6a9, \ub808\uc774\ud134\uc2dc, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \ubcf4\uc99d, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 300\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 6\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc815\ud655\uc131\ub9cc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc778\uc2dd \ub300\uc548\ubcf4\ub2e4 4.4-10.8\ubc30 \ub354 \ube44\uc2fc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud3c9\uac00(N=15)\ub294 CLEAR\uac00 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00(\u03c1=0.41)\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc608\uce21\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(\uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4 \u03c1=0.83)."}}

Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it.

While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 ReflexGrad\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "ReflexGrad\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 TODO \ubd84\ud574, \ucd5c\uadfc \ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud328 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac \uc778\uc2dd \uc778\uacfc \ubc18\uc601, \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "ReflexGrad\ub294 ALFWorld \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c Trial 0\uc5d0\uc11c 67%\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c \uc0f7 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774\ub098 \uc2dc\uc5f0 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c \uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uba87 \uc0f7 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac(Reflexion), \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(TextGrad), \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud588\uc73c\ub098, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 ReflexGrad\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc804\ub7b5 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 TODO \ubd84\ud574, (2) \ucd5c\uadfc \ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud328 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub0b4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac \uc778\uc2dd \uc778\uacfc \ubc18\uc601, (3) \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uba87 \uc0f7 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc21c\uc218\ud55c LLM \uc758\ubbf8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c \uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc608\uc81c, \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ub610\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\ub529\ub41c \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks.

These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc804\ub825 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc815\uc804 \ud6c4 \uc804\ub825 \ubd84\ubc30 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(PDS)\uc758 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub825 \uade0\ud615, \uc804\uc555 \ud55c\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc5f4 \uc815\uaca9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc628\ub2e4.", "method": "HARL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 HAPPO\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubcf5\uad6c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubd80\ud558, DER \uc6a9\ub7c9 \ubc0f \uc2a4\uc704\uce58 \uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "IEEE 123\ubc84\uc2a4 \ubc0f IEEE 8500\ub178\ub4dc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c HAPPO\ub294 DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL \ubc0f QMIX\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834, \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ud68c\ubcf5 \uc804\ub825 \ubc0f \ub354 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\ub4dc \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HARL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c PDS \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc815\uc804 \uc774\ud6c4 \uc804\ub825 \ubd84\ubc30 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(PDS)\uc758 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\ub825 \uade0\ud615, \uc804\uc555 \ud55c\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc5f4 \uc815\uaca9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uae09\uc120 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2e4\uc2dc \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc790\uc6d0(DER)\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2a4\uc704\uce6d \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub5a8\uc5b4\ub728\ub9ac\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO)\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubd80\ud558, DER \uc6a9\ub7c9 \ubc0f \uc2a4\uc704\uce58 \uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uc561\ud130 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc628 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc810 \uac12\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c OpenDSS \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uc804\ub825 \ud750\ub984 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ubb34\ud6a8\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \ub300\uc2e0 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud328\ub110\ud2f0 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b4\uc601 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd1d DER \uc0dd\uc131\ub7c9\uc740 2400 kW\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uba70, \uac01 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uacf5\uae09-\uc218\uc694 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.
