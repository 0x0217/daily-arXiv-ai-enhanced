We propose a Conflict-Based Search with Task Sequencing\n(CBS-TS), an optimal and complete algorithm that alternates between finding new\ntask sequences and resolving conflicts in the paths of current sequences.\nCBS-TS uses a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to optimize task sequencing\nand employs Conflict-Based Search (CBS) with Multi-Label A* (MLA*) for\ncollision-free path planning within a search forest. By invoking MILP for the\nnext-best sequence only when needed, CBS-TS efficiently limits the search\nspace, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining optimality. We\ncompare the performance of our CBS-TS against Conflict-based Steiner Search\n(CBSS), a baseline method that, with minor modifications, can address the TSPF\nproblem. Experimental results demonstrate that CBS-TS outperforms CBSS in most\ntesting scenarios, achieving higher success rates and consistently optimal\nsolutions, whereas CBSS achieves near-optimal solutions in some cases.

This paper\nintroduces a novel vehicle-robot system that leverages the strengths of both\nautonomous vehicles and service robots. In our proposed system, two autonomous\nego-vehicles transports service robots to locations within an office park,\nwhere they perform a series of tasks.

Conventional\napproaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical\nissues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and\nprivacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided\nCritique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine\nparadigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a\nuser's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation\ncriteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's\nbehalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized\ngeneration without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We\nconducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.\nWe designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the\ncontribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations\n(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically\nsignificant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story\nquality.

For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three\ninterpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\\kappa_{\\rm score}$, a rowwise\nsoftmax sensitivity $\\kappa_{\\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\\kappa(V)$.\nWe prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks\nattenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and\nwidth-aware LayerNorm indicator $\\rho_{\\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order\nbound in the $\\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified\nforward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during\ntraining.\n  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components.

Here, we move beyond this dichotomy and\nsystematically explore outcomes across the full range of group sizes. We focus\non multi-agent misalignment, building on recent evidence that interacting LLMs\nplaying a simple coordination game can generate collective biases absent in\nindividual models. First, we show that collective bias is a deeper phenomenon\nthan previously assessed: interaction can amplify individual biases, introduce\nnew ones, or override model-level preferences. Second, we demonstrate that\ngroup size affects the dynamics in a non-linear way, revealing model-dependent\ndynamical regimes. Finally, we develop a mean-field analytical approach and\nshow that, above a critical population size, simulations converge to\ndeterministic predictions that expose the basins of attraction of competing\nequilibria.

When these agents\ndevelop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications\nsuch as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require\nreliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as\nsystems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming\ngame that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We\ncompare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find\nfaster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that\nminimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent\ncoordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uaddc\uc57d \ud615\uc131\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc720\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub984 \uc9d3\uae30 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \ud569\uc758\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uaddc\uc57d \uac1c\ubc1c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \uae68\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN)\ub77c\ub294 \uc774\ub984 \uc9d3\uae30 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ub7c9 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uaddc\uc57d \ud615\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uaddc\uc57d \uc720\ub3c4 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 5.8\ubc30 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ud569\uc758\uc728\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub984 \uc9d3\uae30 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc120 \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \uc751\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e4\uc81c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uaddc\uc57d\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uba74 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uae68\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud611\uc5c5 \ucf54\ub529 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc0b0 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc740 \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc131\uc7a5\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc740 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uaddc\uc57d \ud615\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub984 \uc9d3\uae30 \uac8c\uc784\uc778 Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uaddc\uc57d \uc720\ub3c4 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uacfc \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\ub300 5.8\ubc30 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ud569\uc758\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub984 \uc9d3\uae30 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc120 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub113\uc740 \uc751\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\ud574 \ub098\uc544\uac00\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this setting, given a context, a candidate\ncommittee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve\noptimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to\naddress this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with\nUCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration\nactions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting\nmechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional\nto their predictive power.

While there\nis a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,\nmost methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of\nscientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,\npresenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection\nadapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce\nAutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive\nTesting), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.\nAutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations\nusing a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality\nsimulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide\nprincipled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable\nan extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New\nPhysics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically\nquantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution\n(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,\nphysical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong\nsensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacfc\ud559 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc758 \uccab \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, AutoSciDACT\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacfc\ud559 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uacac \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc7a1\uc74c\uacfc \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AutoSciDACT\ub294 \ub300\uc870\uc801 \ud504\ub9ac\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac00 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AutoSciDACT\ub294 NPLM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uad00\uce21\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uace0 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc8fc\uc785\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacfc\ud559 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uacac \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubb38\ud5cc\uc740 \ub9ce\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uacfc \ud638\ud658\ub418\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc694\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uacac \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ub300\uc870 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac(AutoSciDACT)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uacfc\ud559 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc94\uc6a9 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Walker"], "title": "Predictive Coding Enhances Meta-RL To Achieve Interpretable Bayes-Optimal Belief Representation Under Partial Observability", "comment": "Accepted to Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing\n  Systems (NeurIPS) 2025", "summary": "Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and\ngeneralization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement\nlearning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to\nlearn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This\nrepresentational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and\ngeneralization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which\nsuggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of\nBayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we\ninvestigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into\nmeta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state\nmachine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently\ngenerates more interpretable representations that better approximate\nBayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide\nvariety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies.

In this study, we focused on this\nproblem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student\nengagement levels during online learning. We proposed a novel training method\nwhich can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for\nits predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the\nenforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the\nmodel predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique\nto a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies\nto achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of\nprediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of\n0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model.

The AI market size is projected\nto grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI\nis dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual\nintelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data\nscraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train\nGPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic\nthat prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In\ncontrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the\nnext level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal\nmodels with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions\nin dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning\ncontinuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making\ncapability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's\nlarge models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient\ndomain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of\nuncertainty.

Many existing secure SemCom approaches rely on restrictive or\nimpractical assumptions, such as favorable channel conditions for the\nlegitimate user or prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's model. To address\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel secure SemCom framework for\nimage transmission over wiretap channels, leveraging differential privacy (DP)\nto provide approximate privacy guarantees. Specifically, our approach first\nextracts disentangled semantic representations from source images using\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) inversion method, and then selectively\nperturbs private semantic representations with approximate DP noise. Distinct\nfrom conventional DP-based protection methods, we introduce DP noise with\nlearnable pattern, instead of traditional white Gaussian or Laplace noise,\nachieved through adversarial training of neural networks (NNs). This design\nmitigates the inherent non-invertibility of DP while effectively protecting\nprivate information.

Despite recent advancements in\nreinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to\nfinite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world\nproblems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nalgorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The\nproposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging\nDRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy\nrepresentation.

Examples include model\nselection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in\nfinance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning\nagents.

Its confidence intervals are built\ndirectly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and\nseamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts.

In this paper, we build on the AI\nalignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical\ninsights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and\nan intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator\nthat increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant\npropositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions\nby a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and\nrelated approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning\ninterventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this\nsetting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal\nbehavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative\nRoleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal\ncollaborators.

To address this limitation, we\nintroduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action\nSimulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a\nmodel of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in\ncognitive space. Our agent starts by building a \"cognitive map\" by performing a\nlightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner\nproposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in\ncognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and\nupdate the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On\nthe WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%\nsuccess rate for the previously published state-of-the-art.

Preprint version under review in the area of\n  Artificial Intelligence (cs.CR)", "summary": "Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment\nrecommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient\nsettings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based\nsystems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,\nresulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid\npipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated\ndisease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The\nframework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease\ndataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable\nconfidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.\nLow-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring\nhuman oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical\nSentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample\nMedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a\nfine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by\npost-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug\ninteraction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,\noutperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval\nprecision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic\nsuggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate\nCLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The\nproposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support\nframework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes\nintegrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial\nvalidation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLIN-LLM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud658\uc790

Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale\nrepresentation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,\nweakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast\nand its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a\nmultiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a\nLatent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward\ntraversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields\nacross diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead\ntimes and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability\nfor rare events.

While\ncentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a\ncentral coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer\nfrom scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed\nTraining with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed\nlearning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and\nlimited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion\nModel Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.\nBuilt upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP\nemploys Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future\ntrajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby\nalleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE\nmethods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field\n(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This\ndesign mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with\nminimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further\ntheoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation\nerror introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence\nstability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics.

A Planner\nproposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk\nplans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on\na fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a\nComplexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a\ncomplexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.\nAgents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration\ncaps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10\nCodeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains\npass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with\nmarginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate\nrun-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly\nresource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against\nClaude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at\napproximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness\n(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence\nof TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that\nprofiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving\naccuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "SwiftSolve\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uacc4\ud68d, \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc720\ub3c4 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc758 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 73.08%\uc5d0 \uc774\ub978\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uace0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc740 \uc720\ub2db \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774\ub098 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "SwiftSolve\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc2a4\ucf00\uce58 \uc81c\uc548, \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uacc4\ud68d \ud544\ud130\ub9c1, ISO C++17 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131, \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ub85d, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0c0\uac9f \ud328\uce58\ub97c \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "SwiftSolve\ub294 26\uac1c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc2dc\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c pass@1\uc774 61.54%, 3\ud68c \uc774\ud558\uc758 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ub85c Solved@<=3\uc774 80.77%\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc740 73.08%\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc720\ub3c4 \uc7ac\uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4: LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc720\ub2db \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub300\ud68c \uc2dc\uac04 \ub610\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc720\ub3c4 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 SwiftSolve\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc744 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\ub85c\uc11c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ub9e1\uc73c\uba70, \uacc4\ud68d, \ucf54\ub529, \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d \ub4f1\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud50c\ub798\ub108\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc2a4\ucf00\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc815\uc801 \ud504\ub8e8\ub108\ub294 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, \ucf54\ub354\ub294 ISO C++17 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\ub294 \uace0\uc815 \uc785\ub825 \ud06c\uae30 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ubcbd \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ucd5c\ub300 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uac00\ub294 \ub85c\uadf8-\ub85c\uadf8 \uc131\uc7a5(s, R2)\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 LLM fallback\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790 \ub610\ub294 \ucf54\ub354\uc5d0\uac8c \ud0c0\uac9f \ud328\uce58\ub97c \uc804\uc1a1\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubc84\uc804\ud654\ub41c JSON\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud1b5\uc2e0\ud558\uba70, \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc81c\ud55c\uacfc \uc218\uc775 \uac10\uc18c \uc911\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2dc\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout\nthe editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and\ngeneralization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked\nKnowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines\nneuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron\nfunctional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with\nknowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and\nknowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further\nintroduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to\nthe target knowledge.

Comparing AI and Human Workflows Across Diverse Occupations", "comment": null, "summary": "AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as\nsoftware engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with\nsignificant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments\nhave often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute\nwork, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in\ndiverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by\npresenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across\nmultiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,\ncomputation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare\nheterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable\ntoolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or\nagent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how\nhumans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents\nexhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an\noverwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for\nopen-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the\nUI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of\ninferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and\nmisuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster\nand cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling\nefficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to

Although existing methods\ndemonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their\neffect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains\nlargely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on\nlong-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in\nmodern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more\ncomputation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\npruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with\nperformance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when\nperformance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.\nFurthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to\nrecover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,\nwe identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and\nhighlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to\nreasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning\nstrategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the\nrobustness of reasoning.

This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling\nMachine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these\ncritical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial\nIntelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the\nuncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as\nopposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby\nempowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from\noverconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.\n  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network\n(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief\nfunctions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty\nthrough the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including\nits adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather\nclassification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a\nunified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive\nexperiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning\nnot only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also\nlays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the\nability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and\ndependable systems.

Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available\nsignal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent\nprogress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological\nsignatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low\nsignal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data\ndiversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead\nwearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging\ntransfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG\nfoundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency\nDepartment (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than\n20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to\nsubtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated\nstrong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for\nthirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and\n0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for\nsixteen indicators.

Dropout, a widely\nused regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to\nintroduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its\neffectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of\ninterpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization\nby substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata\nwith simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce\ndynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units\nas cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units.

Our\nfocus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.\nUnfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single\nnarrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI\nsystems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,\nhumans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an\noption that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that \"this is\nnot related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.\nBased on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that\nenables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the\nground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from\ncomplementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to\nmatch the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to\ncombine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide\nfinite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed\nestimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large\nlanguage models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We\nfurther show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how\nwe can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with\nthis partitioned human supervision.

However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs\noften fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete\nnode and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we\npropose \\textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random\nsearches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we\ndemonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\\log |V|)$ searches are needed to\nachieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared\nto the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph\nsize). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are\nuniversal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant\nto graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant\ngraph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular\nand protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to\n16$\\times$ fewer sampled sequences.

However, these models face a\nfundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the\ntokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,\nrisking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,\nintroducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally\nlimit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion\nof the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades\nperformance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for\nmodels with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the\nprimary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to\ninterpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for\nreasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for\nreframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines\nover expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid\nscientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct\nsequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis.

Most SSL approaches rely on\nstrong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse\nviews for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations\nrequires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational\ninvariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we\npropose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces\naugmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete\nframes. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete\nspaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced\nby representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the\ncomplementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves\nsuperior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through\nstrong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine\ndatasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific\ncharacteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without\nrelying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance\ngains of up to 15--20\\% over existing self-supervised approaches.

Certain classes of\nquantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their\nwidespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.\nThis problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its\ncomputational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead\nof training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,\nwe use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$.

Uniquely, at each time\nstep $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by\napplying the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for\nclassical Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each\npotential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link\nprobability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily\nconnected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant\ndistributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across\nagents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the\nglobal mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean\nrewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed\nalgorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip\nalgorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\\log\nT$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the\noptimal centralized regret $O\\left(\\sum_{k: \\Delta_k>0} \\frac{\\log\nT}{\\Delta_k}\\right)$ and an additional term $O\\left(\\frac{N^2 \\log T}{p\n\\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \\frac{KN^2 \\log T}{p}\\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote\nthe total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the\nimpact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link\nprobability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between\ncommunication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal\nregret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the\nsuperiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the\ntheoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.", "AI": {"tldr":

In such cases, to ensure\nthe human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an\nassistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but\nalso estimate how and when this information can be communicated most\neffectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive\nresource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming\ninformation. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which\nmeets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,\nformalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)\nmodelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely\nalignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts\nmessage specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based\non projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence\nattention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several\ntimesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show\nthat this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with\na realistic model of user awareness.

Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based\non cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological\nvariability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from\ndifferent cell types can be projected close together, making accurate\nclustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework\nthat separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is\noperationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion\nprior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while\nto steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional\nobservation space. This unique \"input-space steering\" ensures the denoising\ntrajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers\nthree key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between\nprior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled\nuncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising\nby leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via\naveraging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on\nboth synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves\nclustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset\nshifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved\nbiological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries\nthat better align with known cell type markers and

The emergence of\nnext-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,\noffers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard\nprocessing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of\nextensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the\ndevelopment of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset\nexplicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing\ndiverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to\nidentify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as\ntemperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations\noffer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,\naddressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we\npresent comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish\nbaselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for\ndeploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel\nMovidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic\nactivity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces\nlatency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning\nsystems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster\nmanagement, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard\nmonitoring technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud654\uc0b0

This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,\nperformance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve\nperformance across multiple domains, including navigation, image\nclassification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need\nfor labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain\nexpertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this\nissue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can\ncreate helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques\nrely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased\ncode complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an\nRL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an\nRL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a\ntraining set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the\nperformance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal\nstrategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass\nCIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and\nperforms as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight\nlearning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For\nexample, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve\n80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved\n75.53%.

Submitted to ICASSP 2026", "summary": "Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is essential to enhance\nsystem reliability and reduce maintenance risk. Yet many strong contemporary\nmodels are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,\nhigh-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt\nsensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we\nintroduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds\non a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware\ndetection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts\ndegradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates\ntrue spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive\ntargeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy\nratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across\nbenchmark-ported datasets under an event-triggered protocol, SARNet\nconsistently lowers error compared to recent baselines (RMSE 0.0365, MAE\n0.0204) while remaining lightweight, robust, and easy to deploy.", "AI": {"tldr": "SARNet\ub294 RUL \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud604\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \uac10\uc9c0 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc794\uc5ec \uc720\ud6a8 \uc218\uba85(RUL)\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SARNet\ub294 \ud604\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \uac10\uc9c0 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SARNet\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud3ec\ud305\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uadfc \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub0ae\ucd94\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 (RMSE 0.0365, MAE 0.0204).", "conclusion": "SARNet\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9, \uacac\uace0\ud558\uba70 \ubc30\ud3ec\uac00 \uc6a9\uc774\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc794\uc5ec \uc720\ud6a8 \uc218\uba85(RUL)\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud604\ub300 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uacb0\ud568 \ubc1c\uc0dd \uc8fc\ubcc0\uc5d0\uc11c \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uace0 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uac8c \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc9e7\uace0 \uace0\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c\ub294 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc798\ubabb \uc77d\ud788\uba70, \uace0\uc815 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\ub97c \ub454\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uba85\uc740 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \uc778\uc2dd \uc5f0\uc18d \uac80\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(SARNet)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud604\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(ModernTCN)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \uc778\uc2dd \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yet robust decisions\nunder uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain\nknowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in\nthe physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design\ncollaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and\nAI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of\nHuman AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of\nreliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty\nQuantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human\nexpert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,\nensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,\nenabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population\nlevel, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an\nintuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a\nclassical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop\npractical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution\nfree finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,\nincluding human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we\ncall Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,\nregression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative\nprediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher\ncoverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uacfc AI\uc758

To\naddress this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning\nincrease tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,\na diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)\nno tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled\nexperiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal\nrelationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool\nhallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect\ntranscends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still\namplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,\nappearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is\nmerely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step\nthinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering\nand Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental\nreliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades\nutility.

On the Formal Equivalence Between Agentic AI and the Chomsky Hierarchy", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes\nof modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky\nhierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the\ndefinitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly\nmaps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical\ntask-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents\nemploying readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This\nAutomata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing\nagent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More\ncritically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the\napplication of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety\nand predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the\nboundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally\nundecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents\nby extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative\nrisk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static\nanalysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8

Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) accurately thus becomes a\nfundamental prerequisite for ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.\nHowever, existing QoS prediction methods often fail to capture rich contextual\ninformation and exhibit poor performance under extreme data sparsity and\nstructural noise. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture, QoSMGAA,\nspecifically designed to enhance prediction accuracy in complex and noisy\nnetwork service environments. QoSMGAA integrates a multi-order attention\nmechanism to aggregate extensive contextual data and predict missing QoS values\neffectively. Additionally, our method incorporates adversarial neural networks\nto perform autoregressive supervised learning based on transformed interaction\nmatrices. To capture complex, higher-order interactions among users and\nservices, we employ a discrete sampling technique leveraging the Gumbel-Softmax\nmethod to generate informative negative samples.

Existing approaches suffer from\nlimited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among\nUAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with\nstringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated\ngraph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses\nthese challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer\ndynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal\ndependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships\nand collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop\na dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous\ntrajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a\nreputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with\ngradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust\nknowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%\nIoT device coverage

This\nvisual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content\ngeneration and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,\nprogress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,\na bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To\naddress these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling\nperspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages\nreciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a\nlarge-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex\ninteractive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we\nconstruct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This\npowers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish\na visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,\nvisual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from\nexisting approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks.

However, current Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate\nfluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as\nabstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes\ninto finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This\nrecursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,\nenabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.\nFurthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,\nmulti-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical\ndecision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly\nsurpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates\nexceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that\nunifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful\nand effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

However,\nthe success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and\nverifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent\nSelf-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,\naim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.\nHowever, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback\n(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general\ndomains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose\nMulti-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in\nsolving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge\nQ&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents\n(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies\nreinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors.

Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of\nmodel performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning\nproblem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about\ntheoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions\nabout the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,\nand data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing\nconditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.\nWe examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each\nexemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in\ncomputer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions\nwith WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life\nevents with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the\nconditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,\nbringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological\npractice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine\nlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc608\uce21 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc740 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c

Beyond this,\nself-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation\nto prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a\nself-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain\nexpert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context\nProtocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated\nsuite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful\ntrajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and\nconsolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs\nretrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and\nuse cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across\nseveral benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains\nstrong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves\n83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result\nwhile reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a\nstrong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from\ngeneralist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both\naccuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALITA-G\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac, \ub3c4\uad6c \ubc0f \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub420 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc7ac\uc791\uc131\uc774\ub098 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc7ac\uc2dc\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub354 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "ALITA-G\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(MCP) \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131, \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \ubc0f \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c4\ubcf4 MCP\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \uc6d0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud558\uace0 MCP \uc0c1\uc790\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ALITA-G\ub294 GAIA, PathVQA \ubc0f Humanity's Last Exam\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, GAIA \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0\uc11c 83.03% pass@1 \ubc0f 89.09% pass@3\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc138\uc6e0\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\ub97c \uc57d 15% \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ALITA-G\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\ubcc4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac, \ub3c4\uad6c \ubc0f \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub420 \ub54c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc678\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud588\uc73c\ub098, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc7ac\uc791\uc131\uc774\ub098 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc7ac\uc2dc\ub3c4\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Model Context Protocol (MCP) \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131, \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \ubc0f \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c ALITA-G\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c4\ubcf4 MCP\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \uc6d0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud558\uace0 MCP \ubc15\uc2a4\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc ALITA-G\ub294 \uac01 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \uc124\uba85 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c MCP \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c \ud6c4 MCP \uc2e4\ud589\uae30\uac00 \uc7a5\ucc29\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural\neigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of\ninference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to\ntraditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large\namounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.\nTo tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev\nSubspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data\ngeneration by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked\nby existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier\ntransform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and\nconstructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from\npreviously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing\nredundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method\nto accelerate eigenvalue data generation.

However, many complex\nalgorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,\ndetermining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which\nare, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to\nsub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC\n(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent\ninter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a\nsequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order\ninformation through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from\nsynthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization\nalgorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art\nMARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes.
