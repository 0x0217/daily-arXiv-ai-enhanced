This paper introduces MARINE (Multi-Agent Recursive IN-context Enhancement), a theoretically grounded framework that reconceptualizes test-time reasoning as iterative refinement of a persistent reference trajectory, fundamentally departing from conventional one-shot or multi-sample paradigms. The MARINE refinement operator systematically converts a base model's pass@N capabilities into near-optimal pass@1 performance. Rigorous theoretical analysis establishes that minimal feasible batches maximize expected performance gains under fixed invocation budgets, while logarithmically growing batch schedules ensure continuous improvement without computational constraints. Comprehensive evaluation on the BrowserComp-ZH benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art results, with a 685B-parameter implementation achieving 46.0% pass@1 accuracy. Meanwhile, MARINE establishes a new paradigm for parameter-efficient reasoning: an 80B-parameter model augmented with MARINE matches the performance of standalone 1000B-parameter agents, reducing parameter requirements by over an order of magnitude. Notably, within a fixed computational budget, the proposed MARINE delivers higher-quality samples to alignment and optimization processes than traditional sampling-and-ranking strategies. Consequently, it has great potential to boost post-training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARINE \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, 685B \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\ud604\uc774 46.0% pass@1 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uace0\uae09 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc751\ub2f5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uba70 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc2e4\ud604\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "MARINE(\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d \uac15\ud654)\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc77c\ud68c\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uacfc \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadfc\uac70 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ucc38\uc870 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "BrowserComp-ZH \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, 685B \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 46.0%\uc758 pass@1 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uace0\uc815\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc608\uc0b0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c MARINE\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc815\ub82c \uc804\ub7b5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud6c4\uc18d \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud070 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uace0\uae09 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc751\ub2f5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc2e4\ud604\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 MARINE(\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d \uac15\ud654)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ucc38\uc870 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uc815\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc77c\ud68c\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uacfc \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4.

However, the inherent uncertainty of aircraft trajectories and traffic flows poses significant challenges to both prediction accuracy and trustworthiness. Therefore, prediction models should not only provide point estimates of aircraft landing times but also the uncertainties associated with these predictions. Furthermore, aircraft trajectories are frequently influenced by the presence of nearby aircraft through air traffic control interventions such as radar vectoring. Consequently, landing time prediction models must account for multi-agent interactions in the airspace. In this work, we propose a probabilistic multi-agent aircraft landing time prediction framework that provides the landing times of multiple aircraft as distributions. We evaluate the proposed framework using an air traffic surveillance dataset collected from the terminal airspace of the Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher prediction accuracy than the baselines and quantifies the associated uncertainties of its outcomes. In addition, the model uncovered underlying patterns in air traffic control through its attention scores, thereby enhancing explainability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \ucc29\ub959 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \uada4\uc801\uacfc \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ucc29\ub959 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \ucc29\ub959 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc740 \ud56d\uacf5 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc6d0 \ubc30\ubd84\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \ucc29\ub959 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud56d\uacf5\uae30\uc758 \ucc29\ub959 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud56d\uacf5 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\uc81c\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \ucc29\ub959 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ud56d\uacf5 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \uada4\uc801\uacfc \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc740 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \ucc29\ub959 \uc2dc\uac04\uc758 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\ub3c4 \uc81c\uacf5\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \uada4\uc801\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub808\uc774\ub354 \ubca1\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud56d\uacf5 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\uc81c \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uc811 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ucc29\ub959 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacf5\uc911\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud56d\uacf5\uae30\uc758 \ucc29\ub959 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \ucc29\ub959 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d \uc778\ucc9c\uad6d\uc81c\uacf5\ud56d\uc758 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uacf5\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ud56d\uacf5 \uad50\ud1b5 \uac10\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud56d\uacf5 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This study leverages Large Language Model (LLM) based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate 1-on-1 adversarial debates, creating a controlled \"sociological sandbox\". We employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate hundrets of discussions, measuring the convergence time (defined as the number of arguments required to reach a conclusion) between a baseline control group and treatment groups involving agents with \"toxic\" system prompts. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of approximately 25\\% in the duration of conversations involving toxic participants. We propose that this \"latency of toxicity\" serves as a proxy for financial damage in corporate and academic settings.

In resource-constrained settings, commonly deployed rule-based intrusion detection systems lack the adaptability and ethical safeguards needed to address evolving attack patterns, leading to undetected breaches and excessive blocking of legitimate traffic. This study proposes an Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AAI) framework that integrates reinforcement learning, an explicit ethical governance layer, and human oversight to deliver adaptive and trustworthy cybersecurity. A CPU-optimized simulation environment was developed using a five-node network topology that mirrors key elements of Uganda's critical digital infrastructure and generates both benign and malicious traffic, including phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial-of-service attacks. A Q-learning agent, operating within clearly defined ethical constraints and subject to human auditability, was trained and evaluated against a traditional rule-based baseline. The AAI framework achieved a 100 percent detection rate, zero false positives, and full ethical compliance, compared with 70 percent detection and 15 percent false positives for the baseline system. These results demonstrate that agentic, ethically governed reinforcement learning can substantially improve cybersecurity effectiveness and fairness in CPU-only, resource-constrained environments, offering a practical pathway for operationalizing responsible AI in Uganda's national cybersecurity strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc6b0\uac04\ub2e4\uc758 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc804\ud658\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uacfc\uc758 \uc804\ud22c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6b0\uac04\ub2e4\ub294 \uad6d\uac00 \uc804\ub7b5\uc778 \ube44\uc804 2040\uacfc \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc804\ud658 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub178\ucd9c\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uacc4\uce35, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\uc774 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 100% \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc728, 0% \ud5c8\uc704 \uae0d\uc815\ub960 \ubc0f \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1, \uc724\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ub418\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 CPU\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc640 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\uac04\ub2e4\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc804\ud658\uc740 \ube44\uc804 2040 \ubc0f \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc804\ud658 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uad6d\uac00 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\ub3c4\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub178\ucd9c\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\ub294 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc131\uacfc \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804\uc7a5\uce58\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uce68\uc785 \ubc0f \ud569\ubc95\uc801\uc778 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc758 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ucc28\ub2e8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uacc4\uce35 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AAI) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\uac04\ub2e4\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud55c 5\ub178\ub4dc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec CPU \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud53c\uc2f1, \ub79c\uc12c\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uac70\ubd80 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ubc0f \uc815\uc0c1 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba85\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\ub294 Q-learning \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5c8\uace0 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

To better understand this fragility, we ask a simple question: \\emph{do all actions contribute equally to failure?} Analyzing execution traces on $\u03c4$-Bench (Airline/Retail) and SWE-Bench Verified, we decompose trajectories into \\emph{mutating} (environment-changing) vs.\\ non-mutating steps and formalize \\emph{decisive deviations}, earliest action, level divergences that flip success to failure. A logistic regression reveals that each additional deviation in a mutating action reduces the odds of success by upto $92\\%$ on Airline and upto $96\\%$ on Retail for SoTA models. In contrast, deviations in non-mutating actions have little to no effect. Errors also grow with context length as agents drift from role and act on stale constraints. Motivated by these observations, we introduce \\cm{}, a model-agnostic, gradient-free, test-time safeguard that (i) adds mutation-gated verification, (ii) injects \\emph{Targeted Reflection} before mutating steps, and (iii) performs block-based context cleaning. \\cm{} delivers consistent gains, e.g., Qwen3-Thinking: +28\\% \\emph{relative} on Airline, +11\\% on Retail, and +7\\% on SWE-Bench Verified; Claude: +9\\%/+7\\%. We further identify ceiling effects in $\u03c4$-Bench, where annotation errors and underspecified tasks artificially cap model performance.

It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c AI \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac15\uc870.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c AI\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131.", "method": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub77c\uc774\ud504 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc758 \uac01 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95 \ud0d0\uc0c9.", "result": "AI\uac00 \uc804\uccb4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub77c\uc774\ud504\uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8f0 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc774\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc81c\uc2dc.", "conclusion": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud654 \ucd09\uc9c4 \ubc0f \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \uad8c\uc7a5.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad00\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \ud1b5\ud569, \ud488\uc9c8, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FM)\uc774 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 '\ub450\ub1cc' \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ub9e1\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c FM\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "41\uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \uc99d\uac70 \uc81c\uacf5.", "result": "\uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FM\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5 \uc81c\uc2dc.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FMs)\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 '\ub450\ub1cc' \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub178\ub825\uc774 FM\uc5d0 GUI \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774\ub098 \ud1b5\ud569 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FM\uc5d0 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub2e4\uc74c \uacfc\uc81c\ub77c\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c FM\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ub2a5\ub825: \uc774\ud574, \uacc4\ud68d, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \uc790\ubc1c\uc801 \ucd9c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \uc790\ubc1c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c 41\uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FM\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uad6c\uc131, \ud3c9\uac00, \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \uace0\ub824 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1d\ud799\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Traditional access controls are insufficient, as privacy risks often arise after access is granted; agents may use information in ways that compromise privacy, such as messaging humans, sharing context with other agents, making tool calls, persisting data, or generating derived private information. Existing approaches often treat privacy as a binary constraint, whether data is shareable or not, overlooking nuanced, role-specific, and computation-dependent privacy needs essential for regulatory compliance.\n  Agents, including those based on large language models, are inherently probabilistic and heuristic. There is no formal guarantee of how an agent will behave for any query, making them ill-suited for operations critical to security. To address this, we introduce AgentCrypt, a four-tiered framework for fine-grained, encrypted agent communication that adds a protection layer atop any AI agent platform. AgentCrypt spans unrestricted data exchange (Level 1) to fully encrypted computation using techniques such as homomorphic encryption (Level 4). Crucially, it guarantees the privacy of tagged data is always maintained, prioritizing privacy above correctness.\n  AgentCrypt ensures privacy across diverse interactions and enables computation on otherwise inaccessible data, overcoming barriers such as data silos. We implemented and tested it with Langgraph and Google ADK, demonstrating versatility across platforms. We also introduce a benchmark dataset simulating privacy-critical tasks at all privacy levels, enabling systematic evaluation and fostering the development of regulatable machine learning systems for secure agent communication and computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc84c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, AgentCrypt\ub77c\ub294 \ub124 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uac00 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentCrypt\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud0dc\uadf8\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ub124 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AgentCrypt\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uace0 Langgraph \ubc0f Google ADK\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AgentCrypt\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uaddc\uc81c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc791\ub3d9\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc84c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uaddc\uc81c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uadf8\ub807\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ub41c \ud6c4\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0\uac8c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\ub0b4\uac70\ub098 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uae30, \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc774\ubd84\ubc95\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uacf5\uc720 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c\uc9c0 \uc544\ub2cc\uc9c0\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uaddc\uc81c \uc900\uc218\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc758\uc874\uc801 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9\ud560\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc740 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\ub294 \ubd80\uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 AgentCrypt\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

It is well known that OoM interrupts the whole training itself and wastes substantial computational resources. Therefore, to prevent OoM, accurate prediction of GPU memory usage is essential. However, previous studies focus only on unimodal architectures and fail to generalize to multimodal models, even though the multimodal models are a common choice in agentic AI systems. To address this limitation, we propose a framework that predicts the peak GPU memory usage by analyzing the model architecture and training behavior of multimodal models. Specifically, the framework decomposes the multimodal model into its constituent layers and applies factorization to estimate the memory usage of each layer. Our evaluation shows that our framework achieves high prediction accuracy of ~8.7% average MAPE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\uace0, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubd80\uc871 \uc624\ub958(OoM)\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud568.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd5c\ub300 GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc57d 8.7% \ud3c9\uade0 MAPE\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub530\ub77c\uc11c, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec OoM \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uc7a5\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubd80\uc871(OoM) \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We present a secure, scalable proof-of-concept system for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-augmented patient-trial matching that addresses key implementation challenges: integrating heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data, facilitating expert review, and maintaining rigorous security standards. Leveraging open-source, reasoning-enabled large language models (LLMs), the system moves beyond binary classification to generate structured eligibility assessments with interpretable reasoning chains that support human-in-the-loop review. This decision support tool represents eligibility as a dynamic state rather than a fixed determination, identifying matches when available and offering actionable recommendations that could render a patient eligible in the future.

This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) aims to provide a comprehensive taxonomy of risks in the MCP ecosystem, distinguishing between adversarial security threats (e.g., indirect prompt injection, tool poisoning) and epistemic safety hazards (e.g., alignment failures in distributed tool delegation). We analyze the structural vulnerabilities of MCP primitives, specifically Resources, Prompts, and Tools, and demonstrate how \"context\" can be weaponized to trigger unauthorized operations in multi-agent environments. Furthermore, we survey state-of-the-art defenses, ranging from cryptographic provenance (ETDI) to runtime intent verification, and conclude with a roadmap for securing the transition from conversational chatbots to autonomous agentic operating systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(MCP)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc678\ubd80 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc0c1\uc758 \ud45c\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud611 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uacfc \uc678\ubd80 \uc790\uc6d0 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\uc6b4\ub370, MCP\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "MCP \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \ub0b4 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\uc758 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MCP\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ud5c8\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub300\ud654\ud615 \ucc57\ubd07\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(MCP)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc678\ubd80 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc0c1\uc758 \ud45c\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uba70, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \"\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub97c \uc704\ud55c USB-C\"\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub9e5\ub77d\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589\uc758 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc778\uc2dd \uc624\ub958(\ud658\uac01)\uc640 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ubc18(\ubb34\ub2e8 \uc791\uc5c5) \uac04\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \uc0ac\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud611 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\ud654(Systematization of Knowledge, SoK)\ub294 MCP \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611(\uc608: \uac04\uc811 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc0bd\uc785, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc624\uc5fc)\uacfc \uc778\uc2dd \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8(\uc608: \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc704\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ub82c \uc2e4\ud328)\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MCP \uc6d0\uc2dc\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \"\ub9e5\ub77d\"\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubb34\uae30\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc554\ud638 \uc7a5\uce58 \ucd9c\ucc98(ETDI)\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc911 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud655\uc778\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ucc57\ubd07\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ub9fa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing methods are typically structured around scoring individual points or simple pairs. Such {point- or pair-centric} view not only overlooks the contextual nature of anomalies, which are defined by their deviation from a collective group, but also fails to exploit the rich supervisory signals that can be generated from the combinatorial composition of sets. Consequently, such models struggle to exploit the high-order interactions within the data, which are critical for learning discriminative representations. To address these limitations, we propose SetAD, a novel framework that reframes semi-supervised AD as a Set-level Anomaly Detection task. SetAD employs an attention-based set encoder trained via a graded learning objective, where the model learns to quantify the degree of anomalousness within an entire set. This approach directly models the complex group-level interactions that define anomalies. Furthermore, to enhance robustness and score calibration, we propose a context-calibrated anomaly scoring mechanism, which assesses a point's anomaly score by aggregating its normalized deviations from peer behavior across multiple, diverse contextual sets. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that SetAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, we show that our model's performance consistently improves with increasing set size, providing strong empirical support for the set-based formulation of anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "SetAD\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc9d1\ud569 \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\ubaa9 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc18\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub098 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc30d\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud604\uc0c1\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0, \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\ub294 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub4e4\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "SetAD\ub294 \ubc18\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc9d1\ud569 \uc218\uc900 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uc815\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc8fc\ubaa9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9d1\ud569 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "10\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c SetAD\uac00 \ucd5c\uc2e0\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc9d1\ud569 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5b4, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc18\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0(AD)\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud070 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub098 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc30d\uc5d0 \uc911\uc2ec\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ub610\ub294 \uc30d \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc740 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub418\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc801 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub0b4 \uace0\ucc28 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SetAD\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ubc18\uc9c0\ub3c4 AD\ub97c \uc9d1\ud569 \uc218\uc900 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.

Expected publication in 2026", "summary": "Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called \"empowerment\" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. \"Empowerment\" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 '\uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8'\ub77c\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud574 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc544\uc774\ub4e4\uacfc \uc131\uc778\uc774 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uacfc \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 '\uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8'\ub77c\ub294 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8\uac00 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac04\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5f0\uacb0\uace0\ub9ac\uac00 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc138\uc0c1\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc778\uc9c0\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uc758 \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc778\uacfc \ubca0\uc774\uc988 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud615\uc2dd\ub860 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc804\ud1b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 '\uc784\ud30c\uc6cc\uba3c\ud2b8'\ub77c\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, sharing these identifiers with Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) brings significant privacy risks by enabling long-term tracking and linking of user activities across sessions. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving identifier checking method in 5G. This paper introduces a protocol for verifying device identifiers without exposing them to the network while maintaining the same functions as the 3GPP-defined Equipment Identity Register (EIR) process. The proposed solution modifies the PEPSI protocol for a Private Set Membership (PSM) setting using the BFV homomorphic encryption scheme. This lets User Equipment (UE) prove that its identifier is not on an operator's blacklist or greylist while ensuring that the MNO only learns the outcome of the verification. The protocol allows controlled deanonymization through an authorized Law Enforcement (LE) hook, striking a balance between privacy and accountability. Implementation results show that the system can perform online verification within five seconds and requires about 15 to 16 MB of communication per session. This confirms its practical use under post-quantum security standards. The findings highlight the promise of homomorphic encryption for managing identifiers while preserving privacy in 5G, laying the groundwork for scalable and compliant verification systems in future 6G networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 5G\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc7a5\uce58 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790 \uac80\uc99d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "4G \ubc0f 5G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uce58 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70 \uaddc\uc815\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790 \uacf5\uc720\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PEPSI \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc5ec BFV \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc778 \uc9d1\ud569 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed(PSM) \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uc7a5\uce58 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790 \uac80\uc99d \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 5\ucd08 \uc774\ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\uace0 \uc138\uc158\ub2f9 \uc57d 15\uc5d0\uc11c 16MB\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, 5G\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7a5\uce58 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790\uc778 IMEI(International Mobile Equipment Identity)\ub294 4G \ubc0f 5G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uce58 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uaddc\uc815\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790\ub97c \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc6b4\uc601\uc790(MNO)\uc640 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uba74 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uace0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 5G\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790 \uac80\uc0ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, 3GPP\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc758\ud55c \uc7a5\ube44 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ub4f1\ub85d(EIR) \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 BFV \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc778 \uc9d1\ud569 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed(PSM) \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 PEPSI \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc7a5\uce58(UE)\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790\uac00 \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\uc758 \ube14\ub799\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub098 \uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, MNO\ub294 \uac80\uc99d \uacb0\uacfc\ub9cc\uc744 \uc54c\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uad8c\ud55c \uc788\ub294 \ubc95 \uc9d1\ud589(LE) \ud6c4\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ube44\uc775\uba85\ud654(\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uade0\ud615 \uc870\uc808)\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\ud604 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 5\ucd08 \uc774\ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc138\uc158\ub2f9 \uc57d 15\uc5d0\uc11c 16MB\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790 \ubcf4\uc548 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 5G\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uaddc\uc815\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud558\ub294 \uac80\uc99d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Leveraging this uniquely comprehensive population register, we convert register data from 6.9 million individuals (2001-2013) into semantically rich texts and predict individuals' residential mobility in later years (2013-2017). These life trajectories combine demographic information with annual changes in residence, work, education, income, and family circumstances, allowing us to assess how effectively such sequences support longitudinal prediction. We compare multiple NLP architectures (including LSTM, DistilBERT, BERT, and Qwen) and find that sequential and transformer-based models capture temporal and semantic structure more effectively than baseline models. The results show that textualized register data preserves meaningful information about individual pathways and supports complex, scalable modeling. Because few countries maintain longitudinal microdata with comparable coverage and precision, this dataset enables analyses and methodological tests that would be difficult or impossible elsewhere, offering a rigorous testbed for developing and evaluating new sequence-modeling approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate that combining semantically rich register data with modern language models can substantially advance longitudinal analysis in social sciences.", "AI": {"tldr":

Traditional detection methods that rely on regular expressions, fingerprint features, and high-entropy calculations often suffer from high false-positive rates. This not only reduces detection efficiency but also significantly increases the manual screening burden on developers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent collaborative architectures have demonstrated remarkable potential for tackling complex tasks, offering a novel technological perspective for sensitive information detection. In response to these challenges, we propose Argus, a multi-agent collaborative framework for detecting sensitive information. Argus employs a three-tier detection mechanism that integrates key content, file context, and project reference relationships to effectively reduce false positives and enhance overall detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Argus in real-world repository environments, we developed two new benchmarks, one to assess genuine leak detection capabilities and another to evaluate false-positive filtering performance.

However, such approaches remain largely unexplored in the domain of medical time series. The unique characteristics of the physiological time series signals, such as multivariate, high temporal variability, highly noisy, and artifact-prone, make deep learning-based approaches still challenging for tasks such as imputation. Hence, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based noise estimator within a score-based diffusion framework. Specifically, the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module is designed to enable each channel to adap- tively select desired receptive fields throughout the diffusion process. Moreover, recent literature has found that when generating a physiological signal, performing multiple inferences and averaging the reconstructed signals can effectively reduce reconstruction errors, but at the cost of significant computational and latency over- head. We design a Fusion MoE module and innovatively leverage the nature of MoE module to generate K noise signals in parallel, fuse them using a routing mechanism, and complete signal reconstruction in a single inference step. This design not only improves performance over previous methods but also eliminates the substantial computational cost and latency associated with multiple inference processes. Extensive results demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms diffusion-based SOTA works on different tasks and datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4

Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing a predictive principle of agentic scaling based on measurable task properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uac01\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc870\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc6d0\uce59\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(\ub2e8\uc77c, \ub3c5\ub9bd, \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911, \ubd84\uc0b0, \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 LLM \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c 180\uac1c\uc758 \uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 87%\uc758 \ud640\ub4dc\uc544\uc6c3 \uad6c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc870\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120 \ube44\uc728\uc740 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \ube44\uc728\ub85c \uc9d1\uacc4\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc989 \ucd94\ub860, \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c AI \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \ub418\uc5b4\uac00\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc6d0\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae08\uc735 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, Workbench\ub77c\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 LLM \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(\ub2e8\uc77c, \ub3c5\ub9bd, \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911, \ubd84\uc0b0, \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 180\uac1c \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc, \uc624\ub958 \uc99d\ud3ed, \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 cross-validated R^2=0.513\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ub3c4\uad6c \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504: \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ube44\ub840\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, LLM-empowered applications are vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where instructions are injected via untrustworthy external data sources. This paper presents Rennervate, a defense framework to detect and prevent IPI attacks. Rennervate leverages attention features to detect the covert injection at a fine-grained token level, enabling precise sanitization that neutralizes IPI attacks while maintaining LLM functionalities. Specifically, the token-level detector is materialized with a 2-step attentive pooling mechanism, which aggregates attention heads and response tokens for IPI detection and sanitization. Moreover, we establish a fine-grained IPI dataset, FIPI, to be open-sourced to support further research.

A key challenge lies in simulating environment agents, including background vehicles (BVs) and vulnerable road users (VRUs), that behave realistically in nominal traffic while also exhibiting risk-prone behaviors consistent with real-world accidents. We introduce Controllable Risk Agent Generation (CRAG), a framework designed to unify the modeling of dominant nominal behaviors and rare safety-critical behaviors. CRAG constructs a structured latent space that disentangles normal and risk-related behaviors, enabling efficient use of limited crash data. By combining risk-aware latent representations with optimization-based mode-transition mechanisms, the framework allows agents to shift smoothly and plausibly from safe to risk states over extended horizons, while maintaining high fidelity in both regimes. Extensive experiments show that CRAG improves diversity compared to existing baselines, while also enabling controllable generation of risk scenarios for targeted and efficient evaluation of AV robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRAG\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\uc0c1 \uc8fc\ud589\uacfc \ub4dc\ubb3c\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc548\uc804\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "CRAG\ub294 \uc815\uc0c1\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \ub4dc\ubb38 \uc548\uc804-critical \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc704\ud5d8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CRAG\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CRAG\ub294 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604 \uacb0\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28(AV)\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc8fc\ud589\uacfc \ub4dc\ubb3c\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc548\uc804\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(\ubc30\uacbd \ucc28\ub7c9(BV) \ubc0f \ucde8\uc57d \ub3c4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790(VRU))\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uc0c1 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \ub4dc\ubb38 \uc548\uc804-critical \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131(Controllable Risk Agent Generation, CRAG)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Accepted to the ACL ARR July", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are post-trained through reinforcement learning (RL) to evolve into Reasoning Language Models (RLMs), where the hallmark of this advanced reasoning is ``aha'' moments when they start to perform strategies, such as self-reflection and deep thinking, within chain of thoughts (CoTs). Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM\uc744 RLM\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc8fc\uc785 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998(rSIM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc790\uc544 \ubc18\uc131\uacfc \uae4a\uc740 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub4f1 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc21c\uac04\uc778 ``aha'' \uc21c\uac04\uc5d0 \ucc29\uc548\ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "rSIM \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc18c\ud615 \ud50c\ub798\ub108\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc5f0\uc1c4(CoT)\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uba70, \ub9ac\ub354-\ud314\ub85c\uc6cc \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "rSIM\uc740 Qwen2.5-0.5B\uac00 RLM\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uba70, Qwen2.5-14B\ub97c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud50c\ub798\ub108\ub97c \ud55c \ubc88\ub9cc \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uba74 \uae30\uc874 LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud68d\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c4\uc18d \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(RLM)\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uace0\uae09 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc740 \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc5f0\uc1c4(CoTs) \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc544 \ubc18\uc131\uacfc \uae4a\uc740 \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 ``aha'' \uc21c\uac04\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uc8fc\uc785\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 RLM\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc8fc\uc785 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998(rSIM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud50c\ub798\ub108(\ub9ac\ub354 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\ub294 LLM(\ud314\ub85c\uc6cc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ub9ac\ub354-\ud314\ub85c\uc6cc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 RL(MARL)\ub85c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, rSIM\uc740 Qwen2.5-0.5B\uac00 RLM\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, Qwen2.5-14B\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \ud50c\ub798\ub108\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc5ec \ud55c \ubc88\ub9cc \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uba74 \uae30\uc874 LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud68d\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud50c\ub798\ub108\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\ud68d \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uace0 \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c \ubc94\uc704\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Single-objective Reinforcement Learning approaches typically address this by optimizing a fixed scalarized reward function, resulting in rigid policies that fail to adapt to varying clinical priorities. Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) offers a solution by learning a set of optimal policies along the Pareto Frontier, allowing for dynamic preference selection at test time. However, applying MORL in healthcare necessitates strict offline learning from historical data.\n  In this paper, we benchmark three offline MORL algorithms, Conditioned Conservative Pareto Q-Learning (CPQL), Adaptive CPQL, and a modified Pareto Efficient Decision Agent (PEDA) Decision Transformer (PEDA DT), against three scalarized single-objective baselines (BC, CQL, and DDQN) on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) metrics, we demonstrate that PEDA DT algorithm offers superior flexibility compared to static scalarized baselines. Notably, our results extend previous findings on single-objective Decision Transformers in healthcare, confirming that sequence modeling architectures remain robust and effective when scaled to multi-objective conditioned generation. These findings suggest that offline MORL is a promising framework for enabling personalized, adjustable decision-making in critical care without the need for retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MORL) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec, \uc815\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc911\ud658\uc790\uc2e4\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc99d \uce58\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \uc0dd\uc874\uc728\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc790\uc6d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9(\uc608: \ubcd1\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uba38\ubb34\ub294 \uae30\uac04)\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 MORL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998(CPQL, Adaptive CPQL, PEDA DT)\uc744 MIMIC-IV \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa9\ud45c \uae30\uc900(BC, CQL, DDQN)\uacfc \ube44\uad50 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "PEDA DT \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 MORL\uc740 \uc911\ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc911\ud658\uc790\uc2e4\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc99d \uce58\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \uc0dd\uc874\uc728\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc790\uc6d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9(\uc608: \ubcd1\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uba38\ubb34\ub294 \uae30\uac04)\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MORL)\uc740 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub530\ub77c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \ub3d9\uc801 \uc120\ud638 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c MORL\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MIMIC-IV \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 MORL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998(Conditioned Conservative Pareto Q-Learning (CPQL), Adaptive CPQL, \uc218\uc815\ub41c Pareto Efficient Decision Agent (PEDA) \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 (PEDA DT))\uc744 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa9\ud45c \uae30\uc900(BC, CQL, DDQN)\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Model-based value expansion fits an on-policy value function using length-n imaginary rollouts generated by the current policy and a learned dynamics model. While larger n reduces bias in value bootstrapping, it amplifies accumulated model errors over long horizons, degrading future predictions. We address this trade-off with an \\emph{action-chunk} model that predicts a future state from a sequence of actions (an \"action chunk\") instead of a single action, which reduces compounding errors. In addition, instead of directly training a policy to maximize rewards, we employ rejection sampling from an expressive behavioral action-chunk policy, which prevents model exploitation from out-of-distribution actions. We call this recipe \\textbf{Model-Based RL with Action Chunks (MAC)}.

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline. Remarkably, it reduces per-step token consumption by 3-9X while maintaining strong performance. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of dual-strategy coordination.

Miller", "George Kesidis"], "title": "Improving the Sensitivity of Backdoor Detectors via Class Subspace Orthogonalization", "comment": null, "summary": "Most post-training backdoor detection methods rely on attacked models exhibiting extreme outlier detection statistics for the target class of an attack, compared to non-target classes. However, these approaches may fail: (1) when some (non-target) classes are easily discriminable from all others, in which case they may naturally achieve extreme detection statistics (e.g., decision confidence); and (2) when the backdoor is subtle, i.e., with its features weak relative to intrinsic class-discriminative features. A key observation is that the backdoor target class has contributions to its detection statistic from both the backdoor trigger and from its intrinsic features, whereas non-target classes only have contributions from their intrinsic features. To achieve more sensitive detectors, we thus propose to suppress intrinsic features while optimizing the detection statistic for a given class. For non-target classes, such suppression will drastically reduce the achievable statistic, whereas for the target class the (significant) contribution from the backdoor trigger remains. In practice, we formulate a constrained optimization problem, leveraging a small set of clean examples from a given class, and optimizing the detection statistic while orthogonalizing with respect to the class's intrinsic features.

Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon lookaheads, rendering the search process unreliable at physical boundaries. To address this, we introduce the Prismatic World Model (PRISM-WM), a structured architecture designed to decompose complex hybrid dynamics into composable primitives. PRISM-WM leverages a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework where a gating mechanism implicitly identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict the associated transition dynamics. We further introduce a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity, effectively preventing mode collapse. By accurately modeling the sharp mode transitions in system dynamics, PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings, demonstrate that PRISM-WM provides a superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms (e.g., TD-MPC), proving its potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM-WM\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uad6c\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\ud68d \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub85c\ubd07 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "PRISM-WM\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc774\ud305 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \uc804\uc774 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd \ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ubb38\uac00(MoE) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PRISM-WM\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ub864\uc544\uc6c3 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PRISM-WM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc138\ub300 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub85c\ubd07 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc6b4\ub3d9\uc740 \uc811\ucd09 \ubc0f \ucda9\ub3cc\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub85c \ud45c\uc2dc\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc5ed \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4(\uc608: \ubd99\uae30 \ub300 \ubbf8\ub044\ub7ec\uc9d0, \ube44\ud589 \ub300 \uc815\uc9c0). \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c Smoothing\uc774 \uae34 \uae30\uac04\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc778 \ub204\uc801 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uad6c\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 \ud504\ub9ac\uc998 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378(PRISM-WM)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

A key challenge is ensuring these AI agents are robust, excelling not only in familiar settings observed during training but also effectively generalising to previously unseen and varied scenarios. In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents. We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation. Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation. We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics. Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs. Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM. This work collectively paves the way for future advancements in AI robustness, enabling the development of agents that not only adapt to an ever-evolving world but also thrive in the face of unforeseen challenges and interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud568\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, MiniHack\uacfc Maestro\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc740 \ub04a\uc784\uc5c6\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MiniHack\uacfc Maestro\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MiniHack\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, Maestro\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uad50\uc721 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AI\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0\uc740 \ub04a\uc784\uc5c6\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\uc801 \uc138\uacc4\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uce5c\uc219\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\uc131 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud658\uacbd, \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678 \uc785\ub825 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub978 \ub3d9\ub8cc \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and public policy, the alignment problem--ensuring AI behavior corresponds with human values and intentions--has become critical. Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance. We provide formal mathematical formulations for each component and introduce an Assurance Layer that manages assumption failures through guardian architectures. Three case studies demonstrate IDAIF application across healthcare, cybersecurity, and software engineering domains.

While traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have made strides in leveraging the high-dimensional and complex nature of fMRI data, they often fail to utilize the contextual richness provided by Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) metadata. This paper presents a novel framework integrating transformer-based architectures with multimodal inputs, including fMRI data and DICOM metadata. By employing attention mechanisms, the proposed method captures intricate spatial-temporal patterns and contextual relationships, enhancing model accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.

To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably.

Existing attack strategies typically rely on locally uniform perturbations, which treat all samples indiscriminately. This approach is inefficient, as it wastes the perturbation budget on low-impact samples, and lacks stealthiness due to significant statistical deviations. In this paper, we propose a novel Global Budget Allocation attack strategy. Leveraging the theoretical insight that a sample's influence on value function convergence is proportional to its Temporal Difference (TD) error, we formulate the attack as a global resource allocation problem. We derive a closed-form solution where perturbation magnitudes are assigned proportional to the TD-error sensitivity under a global L2 constraint. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to 80% performance degradation with minimal perturbations that evade detection by state-of-the-art statistical and spectral defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcc0\uc870 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc608\uc0b0 \ud560\ub2f9 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 TD \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ube44\ub840\ud558\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \uc804\ub7b5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcc0\uc870 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc740\ubc00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 TD \uc624\ub958 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c L2 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \ubcc0\uc870 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "D4RL \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \uc804\ub7b5 \ub300\ube44 \ucd5c\ub300 80% \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ubcc0\uc870\ub85c \uace0\uae09 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud68c\ud53c\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcc0\uc870 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcc0\uc870 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubb34\ucc28\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc778 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \uc801\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \ubcc0\uc870 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \ub0ad\ube44\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uba70, \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc740\ubc00\ud568\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc608\uc0b0 \ud560\ub2f9 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218 \uc218\ub834\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc28\uc774(TD) \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ube44\ub840\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c L2 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 TD \uc624\ub958 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ube44\ub840\ud558\uc5ec \ubcc0\uc870 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Current approaches typically employ a control-centric paradigm, forcing agents to navigate complex directory structures and irrelevant control logic. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from the standard Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to the concept of Data Transformation Graph (DTG) that inverts the topology by modeling data states as nodes and functions as edges, enabling agents to trace logic defects through data lineage rather than control flow. We introduce a multi-agent framework that reconciles data integrity navigation with control flow logic. Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the \"Semantic Trap\" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark. Our approach directly addresses the core limitations of current AI code-assistant tools and tackles the critical need for a more robust foundation for our increasingly software-dependent world.",

While Federated Learning (FL) has proven effective on static datasets, its extension to the open-ended self-evolution of agents remains underexplored. Directly applying standard FL is challenging: heterogeneous tasks and sparse, trajectory-level rewards introduce severe gradient conflicts, destabilizing the global optimization process. To bridge this gap, we propose Fed-SE, a Federated Self-Evolution framework for LLM agents. Fed-SE establishes a local evolution-global aggregation paradigm. Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Fed-SE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc81c\ud55c \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uc9c4\ud654\uac00 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "Fed-SE\ub294 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \ub41c \uace0\uc218\uc775 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub85c\uceec \uc9c4\ud654-\uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc9d1\uacc4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc774\uc885 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, Fed-SE\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uc57d 18% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Fed-SE\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uac00 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uac04 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc81c\ud55c \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uc9c4\ud654\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654\ub85c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 FL\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4: \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uba70 \uada4\uc801 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Fed-SE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index

However, existing methods depend on the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for data transmission and action execution, limiting their applicability to Android devices. In this work, we introduce the novel Embodied Smartphone Operation (ESO) task and present See-Control, a framework that enables smartphone operation via direct physical interaction with a low-DoF robotic arm, offering a platform-agnostic solution. See-Control comprises three key components: (1) an ESO benchmark with 155 tasks and corresponding evaluation metrics; (2) an MLLM-based embodied agent that generates robotic control commands without requiring ADB or system back-end access; and (3) a richly annotated dataset of operation episodes, offering valuable resources for future research. By bridging the gap between digital agents and the physical world, See-Control provides a concrete step toward enabling home robots to perform smartphone-dependent tasks in realistic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0 \uc791\ub3d9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 Android \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\ub9cc \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc801\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ESO(Embodied Smartphone Operation) \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc ADB dependency \uc5c6\uc774 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uba85\ub839\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 MLLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c See-Control \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "See-Control\uc740 155\uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c ESO \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c, ADB \uc5c6\uc774 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uba85\ub839\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc791\ub3d9 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc\uc758 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ub2ec\ub9b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "See-Control\uc740 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc881\ud600 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0 \uc758\uc874 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3c4\uc640\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0 \uc870\uc791\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\uc1a1 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud574 Android Debug Bridge(ADB)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec Android \uc7a5\uce58\ub85c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Embodied Smartphone Operation(ESO) \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc800\ucc28 \uc790\uc720\ub3c4(low-DoF) \ub85c\ubd07 \ud314\uacfc\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0 \uc870\uc791\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 See-Control \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc720\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc218 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0dd\uc0b0

While many benchmarks have been developed to assess agent performance, most concentrate on academic settings or artificially designed scenarios while overlooking the challenges that arise in real applications. To address this issue, we focus on a highly practical real-world setting, the e-commerce domain, which involves a large volume of diverse user interactions, dynamic market conditions, and tasks directly tied to real decision-making processes. To this end, we introduce EcomBench, a holistic E-commerce Benchmark designed to evaluate agent performance in realistic e-commerce environments. EcomBench is built from genuine user demands embedded in leading global e-commerce ecosystems and is carefully curated and annotated through human experts to ensure clarity, accuracy, and domain relevance. It covers multiple task categories within e-commerce scenarios and defines three difficulty levels that evaluate agents on key capabilities such as deep information retrieval, multi-step reasoning, and cross-source knowledge integration. By grounding evaluation in real e-commerce contexts, EcomBench provides a rigorous and dynamic testbed for measuring the practical capabilities of agents in modern e-commerce.", "AI": {"tldr": "EcomBench\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc885\ud569 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc84c\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub9ce\uc740 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ud559\ubb38\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc774\ub098 \uc778\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "EcomBench\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \uba85\ud655\uc131, \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uac8c \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \ub2ec\uc558\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ub0b4 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub97c \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\uace0, \uc2ec\uce35 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \ucd9c\ucc98 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud1b5\ud569\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud575\uc2ec \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EcomBench\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\ub300 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\ucd08 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uace0\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \ud559\ubb38\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc774\ub098 \uc778\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9, \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc870\uac74, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ud604\uc2e4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub454\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 EcomBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.
