This transparency also opens a promising\ndirection: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking\nwithin a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and\nexploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the\nusefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this\noff-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can\nstandard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory\nbehaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the\noff-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can\nbacktrack from \"distractions\" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and\nGuidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from\nstronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and\nreveals a counterintuitive finding -- \"stronger\" LLMs on benchmarks are often\nmore fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively\nleverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent\ncapabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control\nstudies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these\nbehaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data\nselection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training\nnatively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal\nrecoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled\nstudents even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,\nthis work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in\nshared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf\nreasoning LLMs."}

Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic\nsearch trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:\nInformation Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error\nRecovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior\nPriming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,\nWebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in\nLlama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models\nwith RL.

Moreover,\ntask-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level\ncode generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and\nlong-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful\nmulti-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from\nprior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,\n(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate\nits effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of\nedge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,\nwhere specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A\ncontroller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary\npreservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This\nyields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge\ncases across unseen codebases.

Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable\naction list would be provided as reference.

This naturally leads to a question: As\nenvironmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation\nfor long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the\neffectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is\nconventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its\neffectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas\n(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., \"move [OBJ]\nto [OBJ]\" -> \"move apple to desk\") to ensure concise action space and reliable\nscalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human\ncognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format\nrestriction.

Near the\nboundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors\nbut produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation\nspace. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for\ndefenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can\nsuppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in\nthat same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple\ngeometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures.\nEmpirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional\ndetectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results\nsurface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer\nanalysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of\ndefenses."}

In\nthis paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.\nFirst, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that\nsimply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous\nworks, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the\nperformance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the\nmeta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a\nsingle agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral\ndiversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess\nwhen automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few\ncases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying\nthe agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over\n15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not\njustify the design cost, regardless of scale."}

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using\nperformance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any\nsituation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed."}

We introduce\npseudo-MDPs (pMDPs) a framework that naturally models such problems and propose\ntwo distinct problem reductions to standard MDPs. One problem reduction\nprovides a novel, counter-intuitive perspective, and combining the two problem\nreductions enables significant improvements in dynamic programming algorithms\nsuch as value iteration. In the case of the LRA which size is parameterized by\n$\\kappa$ (in Ethereum's case $\\kappa$= 325), we reduce the computational\ncomplexity from $O(2^\\kappa \\kappa^{2^{\\kappa+2}})$ to $O(\\kappa^4)$ (per\niteration). This solution also provide the usual benefits from Dynamic\nProgramming solutions: exponentially fast convergence toward the optimal\nsolution is guaranteed. The dual perspective also simplifies policy extraction,\nmaking the approach well-suited for resource-constrained agents who can operate\nwith very limited memory and computation once the problem has been solved.\nFurthermore, we generalize those results to a broader class of MDPs, enhancing\ntheir applicability.

Meanwhile, biological\norganisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical\nworld with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the\nconditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,\nadaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions\nfor physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin\nHeidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and\nbeing-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal\nstates due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these\nconditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining\nintegrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an\nintrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing\ninspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,\nwe examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,\nempowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to\nmeet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to\nmaintain physical integrity.
