Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated\nsignificant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited\nto digital tasks. Their application to physical assets in real-world\nenvironments, however, remains underexplored. In this work, our contributions\nare two-fold: first, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous\ndrone control, and second, a reasoning methodology for individual function\nexecutions which we refer to as ReActEval. Our framework focuses on visual\ninspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial\nreadouts or inspecting equipment. It employs a multi-agent system comprising a\nhead agent and multiple worker agents, each controlling a single drone. The\nhead agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while worker\nagents implement ReActEval to reason over and execute low-level actions.\nOperating entirely in natural language, ReActEval follows a plan, reason, act,\nevaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation\n(e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level tasks (e.g.,\nlocating and reading a pressure gauge). The evaluation phase serves as a\nfeedback and/or replanning stage, ensuring actions align with user objectives\nwhile preventing undesirable outcomes. We evaluate the framework in a simulated\nenvironment with two worker agents, assessing performance qualitatively and\nquantitatively based on task completion across varying complexity levels and\nworkflow efficiency. By leveraging natural language processing for agent\ncommunication, our approach offers a novel, flexible, and user-accessible\nalternative to traditional drone-based solutions, enabling autonomous\nproblem-solving for industrial inspection without extensive user intervention."}

Most existing approaches\nrely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges,\nor employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work,\nwe introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication\non-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and\nassess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of\nthe responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message\ntransmission from high-contributing agents to others.

However,\nlocal LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool\ncalling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and\naccurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a\nmethodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:\ntool selection and argument generation. We propose \"decoupled fine-tuning\", a\nnovel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated\nLoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using\nseparate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present\nDualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using\ndecoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of\nlocal models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation\nstep into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the\ncorresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune\nimplements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required\nfor tool selection.

The problem we address\nis how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and\npolicies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data\nsources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a\nsemantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and\nvelocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),\ncombined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents\ndistinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value\nfunctions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,\nmarking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate\nfeatures, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,\nEDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and\ntemporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline.

Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based\nparameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and\ncontinuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical\nequivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency\ndistillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal\nvector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the\nconditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training\nobjective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential\ncalculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for\ninterpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through\nextensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in\nfew-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,\nspheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3)."}

We\nformalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from\nlimited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates\nthe study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection\nstrategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free\ninformation such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)\nstrategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nmathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent\nCollaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that\nextends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.\nOur method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy\nexploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state\ninformation and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to\nperform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,\nreducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation\nfidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of\nour approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to\nmulti-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on\ntrajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable\nexplanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision\nprocesses. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent\nbenchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google\nResearch Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy\nrobustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations."}

Most vulnerability detection (VD) methods\nare limited by inadequate contextual understanding, restrictive single-round\ninteractions, and coarse-grained evaluations, resulting in undesired model\nperformance and biased evaluation results. To address these challenges, we\npropose MAVUL, a novel multi-agent VD system that integrates contextual\nreasoning and interactive refinement. Specifically, a vulnerability analyst\nagent is designed to flexibly leverage tool-using capabilities and contextual\nreasoning to achieve cross-procedural code understanding and effectively mine\nvulnerability patterns. Through iterative feedback and refined decision-making\nwithin cross-role agent interactions, the system achieves reliable reasoning\nand vulnerability prediction. Furthermore, MAVUL introduces multi-dimensional\nground truth information for fine-grained evaluation, thereby enhancing\nevaluation accuracy and reliability.\n  Extensive experiments conducted on a pairwise vulnerability dataset\ndemonstrate MAVUL's superior performance. Our findings indicate that MAVUL\nsignificantly outperforms existing multi-agent systems with over 62% higher\npairwise accuracy and single-agent systems with over 600% higher average\nperformance. The system's effectiveness is markedly improved with increased\ncommunication rounds between the vulnerability analyst agent and the security\narchitect agent, underscoring the importance of contextual reasoning in tracing\nvulnerability flows and the crucial feedback role. Additionally, the integrated\nevaluation agent serves as a critical, unbiased judge, ensuring a more accurate\nand reliable estimation of the system's real-world applicability by preventing\nmisleading binary comparisons."}

In particular,\nwe introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to\ngenerate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions\neventually.

Specifically, optimizing the communication structure\nbetween agents is critical for fruitful collaboration. Most existing approaches\nrely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges,\nor employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work,\nwe introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication\non-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and\nassess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of\nthe responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message\ntransmission from high-contributing agents to others.

PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using\nprediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader\nexploration during training.
