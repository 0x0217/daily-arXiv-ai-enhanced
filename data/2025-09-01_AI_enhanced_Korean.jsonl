While Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the\nrobustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a\ncollaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team\nto address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by\nanalyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,\nsimulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an\nassessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of\nspecialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a\nconsensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated\ndataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration\ndemonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart\nfailure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent\ndebates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting\nevidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling\na clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward\nmore accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering\ntransaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging\nsystems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal\nentity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the\nvariations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an\ninvestigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment\ntheir knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace\nfunds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy\nmatching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid\nstring similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based\npipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering\nfor unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to\nsupplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of\nprecision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates\nsignificantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')\napproach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based\nsystems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the\nlatter.

However, their application in\nscientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,\nlimited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability\nfor the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has\nemerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating\ndomain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing\nsome limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only\nlimited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require\nintensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In\nthis paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG\nsystems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to\nAlzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as\nthe LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses\ngenerated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model.

It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes,\nconfirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential\nvulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are\noften deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by\nnumerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches\nrely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search;\nhowever, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize\nprogress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified\nconstraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to\ngeneralize to diverse target states and programs.\n  We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed\nfuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing\nprogress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones\ntowards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under\nfuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while\nproviding additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to\ndiverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis\ntools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while\nensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false\nrejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus\nsubstantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in\ndiscovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x.\nSo far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already\nacknowledged with a draft patch.", "AI": {"tldr": "Locus \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0c1\ud0dc

Instead of merely predicting outcomes,\nRL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional\nmodels that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,\nfeedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative\npossibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL\ntypically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,\nimaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.\nThese systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures\nto meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and\ndecision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more\nthan a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical\nenvironments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including\nmodel-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,\nand emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration\nthrough the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL\napplications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,\ndiagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and\ntranslational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze\nRL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons\nfor safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a\ntechnical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative\nrole in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical\nintelligence.",

By combining agent orchestration with\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning,\nPROVSEEK enables adaptive multi-step analysis that iteratively refines\nhypotheses, verifies supporting evidence, and produces scalable, interpretable\nforensic explanations of attack behaviors. By combining provenance data with\nagentic reasoning, PROVSEEK establishes a new paradigm for grounded agentic\nforecics to investigate APTs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on publicly\navailable DARPA datasets, demonstrating that PROVSEEK outperforms\nretrieval-based methods for intelligence extraction task, achieving a 34%\nimprovement in contextual precision/recall; and for threat detection task,\nPROVSEEK achieves 22%/29% higher precision/recall compared to both a baseline\nagentic AI approach and State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Provenance-based Intrusion\nDetection System (PIDS).", "AI": {"tldr": "PROVSEEK\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucd9c\ucc98 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc704\ud611 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c APT\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc815\ub9bd\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "PROVSEEK\ub294 \ubca1\ud130\ud654\ub41c \uc704\ud611 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ucd9c\ucc98 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud2b9\uc218 \ud234\uccb4\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PROVSEEK\ub294 DARPA \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc815\ubcf4 \ucd94\ucd9c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 34%\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744, \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 22%\uc640 29%\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4/\uc7ac\ud604\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PROVSEEK\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uacfc RAG \ubc0f CoT \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uadfc\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucd9c\ucc98 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc704\ud611 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 PROVSEEK\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

To address this gap, this paper\npresents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built\non the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and\ncontinuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)\nfrom 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline\nemploys a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window\nsegmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and\nz-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative\ninput vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three\ncomplementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged\npolarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion\nclassification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.\n(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10\nordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random\nForest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,\nLSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently\noutperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence\ntask and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label

By leveraging domain-approved\nconnections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical\nconcept representations by incorporating contextual information from related\nconcepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating\ndomain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology\nsystems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without\nintegrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept\nrepresentation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,\noverlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a\nlarge language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework\nthat leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis\nknowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to\nenhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first\nemploys LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology\nconcept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept\ndescriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our\nmethod jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by\nperforming knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical\npropagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology\nhorizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of\nLINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with\nexisting EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness\nin scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "LINKO\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ub8cc \uac1c\ub150 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc99d\uac15 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "LINKO\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc678\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc911 \ucd95 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ud559\uc801 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LINKO\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uacf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uc874 EHR \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud638\ud658\ub418\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub85c\uc11c LINKO\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \ud76c\uadc0 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc2b9\uc778 \uc5f0\uacb0(\uc608: \ubd80\ubaa8-\uc790\uc2dd)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uad00\ub828 \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uac1c\ub150 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(\uc608: \uc9c8\ubcd1, \uc57d\ubb3c \ubc0f \uc808\ucc28)\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uba70 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \uc18c\ud640\ud788 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ub150 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \ub0b4 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uac04 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LINKO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Risks are also inherently related to compliance with the new\nlegislation. Objective: The paper investigates how risks are framed in the EU's\nfive core cyber security legislative acts, whether the framings indicate\nconvergence or divergence between the acts and their risk concepts, and what\nqualifying words and terms are used when describing the legal notions of risks.\nMethod : The paper's methodology is based on qualitative legal interpretation\nand taxonomy-building. Results: The five acts have an encompassing coverage of\ndifferent cyber security risks, including but not limited to risks related to\ntechnical, organizational, and human security as well as those not originating\nfrom man-made actions. Both technical aspects and assets are used to frame the\nlegal risk notions in many of the legislative acts. A threat-centric viewpoint\nis also present in one of the acts. Notable gaps are related to acceptable\nrisks, non-probabilistic risks, and residual risks. Conclusion: The EU's new\ncyber security legislation has significantly extended the risk-based approach\nto regulations. At the same time, complexity and compliance burden have\nincreased.

This discrepancy highlights a\ncritical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and\nprocedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional\nreinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through\nenvironmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require\nsubstantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge\nand reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static\nknowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers\nLLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game\nenvironments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory\nabilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a\nlanguage modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are\nrefined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on\nenvironmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully\nbridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving\ncompetitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands\ncompared to conventional RL methods.

Although\nparameter-efficient methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) significantly\nreduce resource requirements, ensuring the security and verifiability of\nfine-tuning under zero-knowledge constraints remains an unresolved challenge.\nTo address this, we introduce zkLoRA, the first framework to integrate LoRA\nfine-tuning with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), achieving provable security and\ncorrectness. zkLoRA employs advanced cryptographic techniques -- such as lookup\narguments, sumcheck protocols, and polynomial commitments -- to verify both\narithmetic and non-arithmetic operations in Transformer-based architectures.\nThe framework provides end-to-end verifiability for forward propagation,\nbackward propagation, and parameter updates during LoRA fine-tuning, while\nsafeguarding the privacy of model parameters and training data. Leveraging\nGPU-based implementations, zkLoRA demonstrates practicality and efficiency\nthrough experimental validation on open-source LLMs like LLaMA, scaling up to\n13 billion parameters.

However, their use of diagonal preconditioning\nmatrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix\nadaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations\nand may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and\nmemory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this\nlimitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix\nadaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we\nutilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update\ndirection at each iteration.

To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that\naggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets\ncalled PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and\nCoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through\ninferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the\nperformance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the\ndevelopment and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion\ndetection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.\nWe also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics\nto ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and\nclosed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each\nconsisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results\nshow that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits\ngroup unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do\nnot. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,\nwith one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.\nFor transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available\non our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0.

Despite their widespread success, LLMs heavily\nrely on external code dependencies from package management systems, creating a\ncomplex and interconnected LLM dependency supply chain. Vulnerabilities in\ndependencies can expose LLMs to security risks. While existing research\npredominantly focuses on model-level security threats, vulnerabilities within\nthe LLM dependency supply chain have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we\nconducted an empirical analysis of 52 open-source LLMs, examining their\nthird-party dependencies and associated vulnerabilities. We then explored\nactivities within the LLM repositories to understand how maintainers manage\nthird-party vulnerabilities in practice. Finally, we compared third-party\ndependency vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem to those in the Python\necosystem. Our results show that half of the vulnerabilities in the LLM\necosystem remain undisclosed for more than 56.2 months, significantly longer\nthan those in the Python ecosystem.

However, AI development faces numerous challenges at various\nlevels.

This\narticle proposes a seven-layer model for AI compute architecture, including\nPhysical Layer, Link Layer, Neural Network Layer, Context Layer, Agent Layer,\nOrchestrator Layer, and Application Layer, from bottom to top. It also explains\nhow AI computing has evolved into this 7-layer architecture through the\nthree-stage evolution on large-scale language models (LLMs). For each layer, we\ndescribe the development trajectory and key technologies. In Layers 1 and 2 we\ndiscuss AI computing issues and the impact of Scale-Up and Scale-Out strategies\non computing architecture. In Layer 3 we explore two different development\npaths for LLMs. In Layer 4 we discuss the impact of contextual memory on LLMs\nand compares it to traditional processor memory. In Layers 5 to 7 we discuss\nthe trends of AI agents and explore the issues in evolution from a single AI\nagent to an AI-based ecosystem, and their impact on the AI industry.\nFurthermore, AI development involves not only technical challenges but also the\neconomic issues to build self-sustainable ecosystem.

Developers are\nincreasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper\nauthorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack\nof transparency in data collection.\n  To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark\nto audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables repository owners to\nverify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic\npreservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR)\nguarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants,\nRepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection,\nRepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect memorization\nwithin the model. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark\nsignificantly enhances sample efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when\nthe user's repository possesses only a small number of code files.\n  Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over\n90\\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\\%. This\nrepresents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all\nof which only achieve accuracy below 55\\% under identical settings.

These facilities\ncontain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long\nperiods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and\nthreaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep\nSpace Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment\nwith different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly\npinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and\ncontinue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space\nmissions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine\nlearning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive\nanalysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets\nthrough statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained\nand tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a\nreinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on\nseverity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each\nanomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time\nthrough human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have\nalso implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,\nparsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program\nor script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,\nwe were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,\ncompleting the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped\naround and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning\nwas utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous\ndata.", "AI": {"tldr":

In this paper, we propose a novel deanonymization attack that can\nlink an IP address of a RPC user to this user's blockchain pseudonym. Our\nanalysis reveals a temporal correlation between the timestamps of transaction\nconfirmations recorded on the public ledger and those of TCP packets sent by\nthe victim when querying transaction status. We assume a strong passive\nadversary with access to network infrastructure, capable of monitoring traffic\nat network border routers or Internet exchange points. By monitoring network\ntraffic and analyzing public ledgers, the attacker can link the IP address of\nthe TCP packet to the pseudonym of the transaction initiator by exploiting the\ntemporal correlation. This deanonymization attack incurs zero transaction fee.\nWe mathematically model and analyze the attack method, perform large-scale\nmeasurements of blockchain ledgers, and conduct real-world attacks to validate\nthe attack.

LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most\nsuitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a\nsupervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM\npairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and\nface evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a\ncontextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit\nfeedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries\n(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a\nshared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are\naligned to reflect their affinity.

Forgetting has many\nfacets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a\nconditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing\nforgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable\nelimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to\nfocus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic\nprogramming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief\nrevision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical\ndeduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we\ntake an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic\nstates with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional\nlogic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic\nbackground means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to\nthe epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and\ninstantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking\nfunctions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic\nprogramming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating\nforgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations\naccording to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview\nhighlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad00\ub9ac \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\uc5d0\uc11c

This framework highlights unique challenges of LLM-driven phishing,\nproviding a coherent foundation for understanding the evolving threat landscape\nand guiding the design of more resilient defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud53c\uc2f1 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ub17c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud53c\uc2f1 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud53c\uc2f1 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Generation-Characterization-Defense (GenCharDef)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, LLM \uc0dd\uc131 \ud53c\uc2f1\uacfc \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\uc2f1\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uc810\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\uc2f1\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\uc2f1\uc758 \uc704\ud611 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud53c\uc2f1\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc8fc\uccb4\ub97c \ud749\ub0b4 \ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud6d4\uce58\uac70\ub098 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c \uacf5\ud559\uc758 \ub9cc\uc5f0\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\uc2f1\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub0ae\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc740\ud3d0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ubd84 \uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c '\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ud53c\uc2f1' \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc99d\ub300\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on\nheuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of\ngenerative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the\nprivacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this\npaper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically\nexploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly\noverfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose\nGenerative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally\nefficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,\nformulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a\nsurrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic\ndata. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model\narchitectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently\ndominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.\nThese results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for\nthe release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed\nby

Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the\nstates are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the\natoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not\nfull STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the\nactions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different\nversions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the\ntraces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all\nobservable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as\nthe atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,\nand the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not\nthe ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the\nlearning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,\nwhere certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions\nwhich can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The\nlearning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+\nstate-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,\nconstructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or\n``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground\nthe implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of\nSYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces\nobtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\ub529 \ud0c0\uc77c \ud37c\uc990\uc758 \ub9ac\ud504\ud305\ub41c STRIPS \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \ucd94\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \uc561\uc158 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c STRIPS+\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\ub529 \ud0c0\uc77c \ud37c\uc990\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \ucd94\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 STRIPS+ \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, SYNTH\ub77c\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \ucd94\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c STRIPS+ \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SYNTH\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc644\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0, STRIPS+ \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bb\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \ucd94\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\ub529 \ud0c0\uc77c \ud37c\uc990\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \ucd94\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \uc704\uce58\ub9cc \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\ub529 \ud0c0\uc77c \ud37c\uc990\uc758 \ub9ac\ud504\ud305\ub41c STRIPS \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud55c STRIPS \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\uba70, \u2018\ube48\u2019 \uc704\uce58\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc6d0\uc790\uac00 \ub204\ub77d\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ud589\ub3d9 \ub610\ud55c \uc644\uc804\ud55c STRIPS\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\uba70, \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc640 \uc804\uc81c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac1d\uccb4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ucd94\uc801\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc644\uc804\ud55c STRIPS \ud589\ub3d9\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc6d0\uc790\uac00 \ubaa8\ub450 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ub824\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc124\uc815\uc740 \ub354 \u2018\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\u2019\uc774\ub2e4. \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc6d0\uc790\ub294 \uc138\uc0c1\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc644\uc804\ud55c STRIPS \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub294 \uc544\ub2c8\uba70, \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc778\uc218\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc9c0\ub9cc STRIPS\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc778\uc218\ub294 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 STRIPS\uc758 \ubcc0\ud615\uc778 STRIPS+\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\uc815 STRIPS \ud589\ub3d9 \uc778\uc218\uac00 \uc804\uc81c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc554\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uaca8\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc774\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac \uc591\ud654\ub3c4 \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 STRIPS+ \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \ucd94\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c STRIPS+ \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 SYNTH\ub294 \uac01 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uace0\uc720 \uac1d\uccb4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uace0 STRIPS+ \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc554\uc2dc\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc778\uc218\ub97c \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc804\uc81c \uc870\uac74 \ud45c\ud604 \ub610\ub294 \u2018\uc9c8\uc758\u2019\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, secure\nonboarding-provisioning credentials and establishing trust with cloud\nplatforms-remains a considerable challenge. Traditional onboarding methods\noften rely on centralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) models and\nmanufacturer-controlled keys, which introduce security risks and limit the\nuser's digital sovereignty. These limitations hinder the widespread deployment\nof scalable IoT solutions. This paper presents a novel onboarding framework\nthat builds upon existing network-layer onboarding techniques and extends them\nto the application layer to address these challenges. By integrating consortium\nblockchain technology, we propose a decentralized onboarding mechanism that\nenhances transparency, security, and monitoring for smart home architectures.\nThe architecture supports device registration, key revocation, access control\nmanagement, and risk detection through event-driven alerts across dedicated\nblockchain channels and smart contracts. To evaluate the framework, we formally\nmodel the protocol using the Tamarin Prover under the Dolev-Yao adversary\nmodel. The analysis focuses on authentication, token integrity, key\nconfidentiality, and resilience over public channels. A prototype\nimplementation demonstrates the system's viability in smart home settings, with\nverification completing in 0.34 seconds, highlighting its scalability and\nsuitability for constrained devices and diverse stakeholders. Additionally,\nperformance evaluation shows that the blockchain-based approach effectively\nhandles varying workloads, maintains high throughput and low latency, and\nsupports near real-time IoT data

In this paper, we introduce a novel\nclass of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called\nDeep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a\nhierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory\ncapacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual\nconnections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including\nrandomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their\neffect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary\nand sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN.

We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a\nbenchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while\npreserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each\nitem is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that\nmust be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and\ncross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,\nSpatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require\nextrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,\nsignage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to\nout-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a\nmodel-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of\nclosed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search\nand 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source\nmodel (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20\nrounds of search.

Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are\nrigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,\nrequiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures\ndepend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent\nin wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both\nmultidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological\nscience and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z\nnumbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score\n(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,\nparticipants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral\ndilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which\nwere mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of\neach individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with\nmembership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In\na proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom\nrepresentations that correlated modestly but significantly with established\nscales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting\nconvergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to\nformalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,\noperationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing\nmeasurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI\nsystems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,\nmiddle ground

Analysts spend days\ntriaging these results, creating a bottleneck in the security pipeline.\nMeanwhile, genuinely exploitable vulnerabilities often slip through, leaving\nopportunities open to malicious counterparts.\n  We introduce A2, a system that mirrors how security experts analyze and\nvalidate Android vulnerabilities through two complementary phases: (i) Agentic\nVulnerability Discovery, which reasons about application security by combining\nsemantic understanding with traditional security tools; and (ii) Agentic\nVulnerability Validation, which systematically validates vulnerabilities across\nAndroid's multi-modal attack surface-UI interactions, inter-component\ncommunication, file system operations, and cryptographic computations.\n  On the Ghera benchmark (n=60), A2 achieves 78.3% coverage, surpassing\nstate-of-the-art analyzers (e.g., APKHunt 30.0%). Rather than overwhelming\nanalysts with thousands of warnings, A2 distills results into 82 speculative\nvulnerability findings, including 47 Ghera cases and 28 additional true\npositives. Crucially, A2 then generates working Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) for 51\nof these speculative findings, transforming them into validated vulnerability\nfindings that provide direct, self-confirming evidence of exploitability.\n  In real-world evaluation on 169 production APKs, A2 uncovers 104\ntrue-positive zero-day vulnerabilities. Among these, 57 (54.8%) are\nself-validated with automatically generated PoCs, including a medium-severity\nvulnerability in a widely used application with over 10 million installs.", "AI": {"tldr": "A2 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 Android \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \uc2e4\uc81c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ucc3e\uc544\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 Android \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc218\ucc9c \uac1c\uc758 \uacbd\uace0\ub85c \ud300\uc744 \uc555\ub3c4\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc591\uc131 \uc0ac\ub840\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc18c\ube44\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "A2\ub294 (i) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac(\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc774\ud574 \uacb0\ud569)\uacfc (ii) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uac80\uc99d(Android\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4.", "result": "Ghera \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c(n=60)\uc5d0\uc11c A2\ub294 78.3%\uc758 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubd84\uc11d \ub3c4\uad6c(APKHunt 30.0%)\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

We give a minimal, self-contained account of this\nstep as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The\ndiscrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical\nmultiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is\nthe replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context\nand temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside\nthe simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the\ncommon ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The\nanalysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an\nexact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus\nsampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline\na controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection\nto loop-like, hallucination-style behavior.

Similar proposals have\nbeen made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been\ncharacterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would\nresult in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may\nhelp diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail\nto capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on\ncounterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an\n\\ltlf formula $\\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual\nscenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that\ncomply with $\\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of\ncounterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that\nmust satisfy $\\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of\ngenerating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are\nallowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only\nas expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical\nviability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct\npractical algorithms in this area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc124\uba85 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc124\uba85 \uae30\ubc95\uc774 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uace0\uae09 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 ltlf \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub294 \ud574\ub2f9 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc218\uc815 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ubcc0\uacbd\uc774 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ub420 \ub54c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc124\uba85(CEs)\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc790\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc81c\uc548\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc73c\uba70, CEs\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub418\uc5b4 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uace0\uae09 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc124\uba85 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c $P$\uc640 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 ltlf \uacf5\uc2dd $\theta$\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c, \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub294 $\theta$\ub97c \uc900\uc218\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 $P$\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc218\uc815 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 $\theta$\ub97c \ub9cc\uc871\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c8\uc801 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 $P$\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ubcc0\uacbd\uc774 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ub420 \ub54c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc885\uc885 $P$\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub4e0\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

In particular, a series of\nremarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,\nexhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For\nexample, notable claims include that a single training example can match the\nperformance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not\nneed to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can\nmatch or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise\nconditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they\nfail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that\ndifferentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits\nstrong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated\ntask. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of\ncounterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across\ndifferent model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while\nstandard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these\ncounterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit\nstrong model-task alignment.

However, its application faces\nsignificant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized\napproaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce\nHealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining\napplications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive\nwrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address\nunfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and\nreport generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that\ndiverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis\nprogression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five\nstate-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its\nfunctionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four\nproof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its\ncapability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation\nusing five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model\nstrengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency\nscores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By\nintegrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation\nand report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with\nprocess mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data\nscientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven\ninterpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in\ntranslating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights\nfor

This\nwork presents a lightweight dual-detection framework combining statistical\nthresholding and machine learning (ML) for real-time anomaly detection. By\nsimulating anomalies via delays and ciphertext corruption, we collect timing\nand data features to evaluate two strategies: (1) a statistical threshold\nmethod based on execution time and (2) a Random Forest classifier trained on\nblock-level anomalies. Implemented on CPU and FPGA (PYNQ-Z1), our results show\nthat the ML approach outperforms static thresholds in accuracy, while\nmaintaining real-time feasibility on embedded platforms.

For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,\nwe design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a\nVAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and\nFashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a\nrunning mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic\nsamples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based\nmethod, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in\nsubsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental\nbenchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art\nmemory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving\nover best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\\% and $7$\\%, respectively.

Based on these functions, we\nconstruct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark\nprogression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how\nto use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same\ndomain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a\nfew small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.\nIf a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant\nimprovement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks\ncapture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated\nplanner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the\nsame domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub79c\ub4dc\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc1c\uacac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c

However, their heavy\nreliance on large amounts of data, often collected from unsanitized online\nsources, exposes them to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject\nmalicious samples to subtly bias model behavior. Recent targeted attacks\nsilently replace secure code with semantically equivalent but vulnerable\nimplementations without relying on explicit triggers to launch the attack,\nmaking it especially hard for detection methods to distinguish clean from\npoisoned samples. We present a systematic study on the effectiveness of\nexisting poisoning detection methods under this stealthy threat model.\nSpecifically, we perform targeted poisoning on three DL models (CodeBERT,\nCodeT5+, AST-T5), and evaluate spectral signatures analysis, activation\nclustering, and static analysis as defenses.

While\nML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate\naerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly\nevolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single\nmodel demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel\nmeta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a\nstrength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated\ngating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three\nheterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable\nmulti-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph\nneural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution\nnetwork. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,\nassigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in\npredicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model\ncollapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy\nregularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is\ntrained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark\nof high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics.

Attribution patching offers a\nfaster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced\nreliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce\nRelevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution\npatching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance\nPropagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the\nlayers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local\npropagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or\nimproved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only\ntwo forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency\nwhile improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and\ntasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than\nstandard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and\nMLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for\nMLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation\nof 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by\nRelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits\nidentified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves\ncomparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with\nIG.", "AI": {"tldr": "Relevance Patching (RelP)\uc740 Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub798\ud55c \uc804\ud30c \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud328\uce6d\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud328\uce6d\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ucc3e\uc544\ub0b4\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc800\uc790\ub294 RelP\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "RelP\ub294 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud328\uce6d\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c LRP\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub798\ud55c \uc804\ud30c \uacc4\uc218\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec, \ub450 \ubc88\uc758 \uc804\ubc29 \ud1b5\uacfc\uc640 \ud55c \ubc88\uc758 \ud6c4\ubc29 \ud1b5\uacfc\ub9cc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "RelP\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub418\uc5b4, \ud2b9\ud788 \uac04\uc811 \ubaa9\uc801\uc5b4 \uc2dd\ubcc4(IOI) \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c MLP \ucd9c\ub825 \ubd84\uc11d \uc2dc, \ud45c\uc900 \uae30\uc5ec \ud328\uce6d\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud328\uce6d\uc5d0 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc798 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud654\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RelP\ub294 IG\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud328\uce6d\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ub85c\uceec\ub77c\uc774\uc9d5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud45c\uc900 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc5ec \ud328\uce6d\uc740 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae4a\uace0 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a1\uc74c\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc800\ud558\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ud30c \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uae30\uc5ec \ud328\uce6d\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 Relevance Patching (RelP)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The\nproposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and\nbusiness stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,\ncontextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The\ncore optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a\nnetwork of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a\nmixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,\nRESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,\nconfiguration updates, and simulation-based insights.

In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client\nselection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring\nunder-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.\nUnder a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final\naccuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedOwen\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc0e4\ud50c\ub9ac \uac12\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc885 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uac00\uc7a5 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc218\ub834\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FedOwen\uc740 \uc624\uc6ec \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc608\uc0b0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0e4\ud50c\ub9ac \uac12\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uace0\uae09 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc800\uc18c\ub4dd \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c, FedOwen\uc740 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ub3d9 \uac70\ub798 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac19\uc740 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 23% \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FedOwen\uc740 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0, \ub354 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3c4\uc640\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub178\ucd9c \uc5c6\uc774 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \ube68\ub9ac \uc218\ub834\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uac00\uc7a5 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0e4\ud50c\ub9ac \uac00\uce58\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc740 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5f0\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud604 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FedOwen\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc624\uc6ec \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ucd1d \ud3c9\uac00 \uc608\uc0b0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0e4\ud50c\ub9ac \uac12\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uadfc\uc0ac \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \uc791\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, FedOwen\uc740 \uace0\uae09 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc800\uc18c\ub4dd \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ub4dc\ubb3c\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c, FedOwen\uc740 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ubd84\ud3ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ub300\ube44 \ucd5c\ub300 23% \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and\ncorrelate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the\nsearch space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby\naffecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search\nusing several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in\nMulti-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible\nheuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original\nversion does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm\nthat requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time\nsolution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime\nversion that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually\nimproves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime\nRepairing A* (ARA*) algorithm.

However, current diffusion watermarking methods face\nsignificant limitations: zero-bit watermarking systems lack the capacity for\nlarge-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are highly sensitive to\ncertain image transformations or generative attacks, resulting in a lack of\ncomprehensive robustness. In this paper, we propose OptMark, an\noptimization-based approach that embeds a robust multi-bit watermark into the\nintermediate latents of the diffusion denoising process. OptMark strategically\ninserts a structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and a detail\nwatermark late to withstand image transformations, with tailored regularization\nterms to preserve image quality and ensure imperceptibility. To address the\nchallenge of memory consumption growing linearly with the number of denoising\nsteps during optimization, OptMark incorporates adjoint gradient methods,\nreducing memory usage from O(N) to O(1).

Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by\nmeasuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while\nsequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects\nan instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates\nparameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The\nresulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and\nbias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.\n  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\\times$ Online/Batch) to\ndisentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize\nthe protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a\nheuristic \"oracle reference band\" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.\nBaseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods\n(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and\npretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in\nearly-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,\nwhile pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models\nremain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.\n  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements\nconventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing\nlearners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the\nfirst examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc801\uc751 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 Guess-and-Learn (G&L) v1.0\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc801\uc751 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uc5b4 \uc801\uc751 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "G&L v1.0\uc740 \ucf5c\ub4dc \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8 \uc801\uc751\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ucd1d \uc2e4\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MNIST \ubc0f AG News\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucd08\uae30 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uc801\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "G&L\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uba70, \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc608\uc81c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc885 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub9cc\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc5ec, \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751 \ube44\uc6a9\uc778 \ub204\uc801 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases\nshaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be\ninevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble\nDiagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that\norchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather\nthan collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that\nsuppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential\nstrengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician\nverification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large\nlanguage models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both\nconsensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty\nand latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated\nclinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can\nenhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision.

This paper introduces CALM\n(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for\nreal-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built\non the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm\nfoundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's\nnovelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,\ncontinuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to\nadapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an\nLLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,\ncontext-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training\ndataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful\npattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our\nresults demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC\nscore in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,\nvalidating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining\nhigh-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "CALM\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\ud615 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc815\uc0c1\ud615 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub098, \uac1c\ub150 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud560 \ub54c \uc804\ud1b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "CALM\uc740 Apache Beam \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucc98\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc704\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ucd95\ub418\uba70, \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud31c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \ub2eb\ud78c \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc801 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 ROC AUC \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc801\uc751\ud615 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CALM\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc815\uc0c1\ud615 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CALM(\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 LLM\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ub85c \ud558\ub294)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream\n(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro\ndatabase. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different\nsubjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis\n(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By\nevaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and\nADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high\nperformance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals.

Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from\nprevious tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to\nprotect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data\nprivacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are\ndissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding\nGenerative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired\nby the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the \"wake\" phase, the system rapidly\nlearns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,\nG-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the \"sleep\" phase, the system\nenters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data\n(\"dreams\") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor\nvia knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw\ndata, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant\nadvantages in privacy and storage efficiency.

A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the\nmodel after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs\nprohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine\nunlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove\nsensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.\nRecently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by\nintegrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information\nto identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA\nadapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires\naccess to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental\nassumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in\nimportance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel\nunlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in\nFILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget\nset.

However, standard gradient\nguidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward\nlandscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios\ninvolving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and\nmulti-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches\nrequire task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time\nflexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion\nPlanner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances\nexploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame\ntest-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:\n(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle\nguidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined\nthrough fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the\nlimitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and\nharnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only\npretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three\ndiverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze\nmulti-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches on all tasks.

Two\nsalient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated\nusing an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is\nnot a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is\noften used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We\ninvestigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call\nregularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges\nunder mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined\nregularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the\nbehavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a\nvariant of RASQL that learns periodic policies.

A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from\nits K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some\ntokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation\nby selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average\nreconstruction but risks an \"activation lottery,\" where rare high-magnitude\nfeatures crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this\nissue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)\nof the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate\npool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch\nfrom the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between\nbatch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$\nglobally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward\nstandard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch.

However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over\nextended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task\nof generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series\nexhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also\nundergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term\ndependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the\nother hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships\nbetween different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing\nboth intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important\nchallenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative\nmodel for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through\nstage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model\npreserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data\ndistribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence\ndecomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different\ntime scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel\nfusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent\nmodeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,\neffectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of\nlong-term time series.

One\nkey insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that\nwide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)\npromote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in\ninput data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more\nsensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the\ninherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient\ndescent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in\nwhich curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy\nTailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects\nheavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to\nenhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as\nsharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss\nlandscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide\nbasins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise\ninto an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD\nconsistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like\nMNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It\nultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves\ngeneralization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning\nrate choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "AHTSGD\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ubb34\uac70\uc6b4 \uaf2c\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc190\uc2e4 \uacbd\uad00\uc758 \ub0a0\uce74\ub85c\uc6c0\uc774 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uaf2c\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub85c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Adaptive Heavy Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ucd08\uae30 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ubb34\uac70\uc6b4 \uaf2c\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ub0a0\uce74\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc774 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ub418\uba74 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uaf2c\ub9ac \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AHTSGD\ub294 MNIST\uc640 CIFAR-10 \uac19\uc740 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c SGD \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, SVHN\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\uc800\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AHTSGD\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \ubd88\ub7c9 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud558\uace0, \uae68\ub057\ud55c \ubc0f \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \ud559\uc2b5\ub960 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \ubc1b\uc544\ub4e4\uc5ec\uc9c0\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \ub113\uc740 \ubd84\uc9c0\uac00 (\uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed) \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub098 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub354 \ud070 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74\uc5d0 \ub0a0\uce74\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12\uc740 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \ub354 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uace0 \ub35c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\uc0ac \ud558\uac15\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc911\ub7c9 \uaf2c\ub9ac \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud559\uc2b5 \uc911 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub97c \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc911\ub7c9 \uaf2c\ub9ac \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\uc0ac \ud558\uac15\ubc95 (AHTSGD)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub354 \ubb34\uac70\uc6b4 \uaf2c\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ub0a0\uce74\ub85c\uc6c0\uc774 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub354 \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uaf2c\ub9ac \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub85c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4.

This method transforms the network data into a\nmodel within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's\nperformance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on\nthese proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this\napproach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the\nreservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.\nData from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated\nform with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted\nnetwork. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks\nas a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state\nnetwork (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on\nwhich a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep\nneural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use\nneuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then\nshow how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how\nit visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as\nproof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time\nmonitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile\ncommunication

As the number of such\nspecialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without\nretraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often\nrely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching\nwhile treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the\ninter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads\nto distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when\nchanges in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We\nidentify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to\nthe phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.\nTo address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure\nthat updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly\naccounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model\nthrough a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating\ndegradation caused by covariate shift.

These processes are inherently complex and\nexhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process\nvariables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for\nefficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for\nunsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an\nensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a\nbenchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a\ncontinuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by\nsudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid\nquantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real\nphotonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the\nhybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates.

The expected value averages the\nperformance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying\nthe agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the\nperformance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing\nthe long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.\nIn this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard\nensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term\nperformance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator\nfor the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative\nreward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.\nTo address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified\ngeometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an\nestimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a\nregularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the\npolicy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously.

This is a preprint of an article submitted to IEEE\n  Transactions on Information Theory", "summary": "In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been\nan increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean\nspace. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,\nand they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical\nstructures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret\nminimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have\nbeen developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on\nthe choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to\nRiemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the\ngeometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML\n(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and\ncoincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in\nEuclidean space.

We present\nthe Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end\nvia surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor\nplasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight\ndendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard\nDecision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,\nMountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes\nper decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude\nreduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with\nneuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power\ncontrol on embedded and wearable devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "SNN-DT\ub294 LEAKY INTEGRATE-AND-FIRE \ub274\ub7f0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc800\uc804\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83.", "method": "Leaky Integrate-and-Fire \ub274\ub7f0\uc744 \uac01 \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758 \ube14\ub85d\uc5d0 \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ub300\uccb4 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc778 \uac00\uc18c\uc131\uacfc \uc704\uc0c1 \uc774\ub3d9\ub41c \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \uae30\ubc18 \uc704\uce58 \uc778\ucf54\ub529, \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \ub374\ub4dc\ub9ac\ud2f1 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c SNN-DT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "SNN-DT\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 Decision Transformer \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ub9de\uba39\uac70\ub098 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacb0\uc815\ub2f9 \uc5f4 \ubc88 \uc774\ud558\uc758 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c\ub97c \ubc29\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SNN-DT\ub294 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc2e0\uacbd\ud615 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub0b4\uc7a5 \ubc0f \ucc29\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc800\uc804\ub825 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Transformer \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uce58\ubc00\ud55c \ud589\ub82c \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc804\ub825 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\ub294 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud0b9 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \ucd08\uc800\uc804\ub825, \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc57d\uc18d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud0b9 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubc18\ud658 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc6d0\ud65c\ud558\uac8c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc120\ud589 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Leaky Integrate-and-Fire \ub274\ub7f0\uc744 \uac01 \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758 \ube14\ub85d\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \ub300\uccb4 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc778 \uac00\uc18c\uc131, \uc704\uc0c1 \uc774\ub3d9\ub41c \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \uae30\ubc18 \uc704\uce58 \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc0f \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub374\ub4dc\ub9ac\ud2f1 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud0b9 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(SNN-DT)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uad6c\ud604\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c(CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacb0\uc815\ub2f9 10\ud68c \uc774\ud558\uc758 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c\ub97c \ubc29\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\ub2f9 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c\uac00 4\ubc30 \uc774\uc0c1\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ub300\ub9ac\uac12\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc2e0\uacbd\ud615 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 SNN-DT\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud615 \ubc0f \ucc29\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc800\uc804\ub825 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc5fd\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, their performance degrades sharply on harder\ninstances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental\narchitectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation\nthrough the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local\nconnectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random\nk-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature\ndecreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based\nSAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range\ndependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.\nWe validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm\nthat curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used\nto predict performance.

Operationalizing this\nprinciple for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,\nremains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on\nminimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a\nnovel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and\ninvestigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that\nsubstantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without\nsignificant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically\ndetermined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,\nchoice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference\ncomplexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude\nthat data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on\nthe technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'\ndifficult to implement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa9\uc801\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubc94\uc704\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubc95\uc801 \uc6d0\uce59\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ucd94\ub860 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc6b4\uc601\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ucd94\ub860 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac10\uc18c\uac00 \uae30\uc220\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc740 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc124\uc815\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud06c\uac8c \uc88c\uc6b0\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 '\ud544\uc694\uc131'\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa9\uc801\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubc94\uc704\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubc95\uc801 \uc6d0\uce59\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ucd94\ub860 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac10\uc18c\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uae30\uc220\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc740 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc124\uc815(\uc608: \uc131\ub2a5 \ubaa9\ud45c, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd)\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\uc131(\uc608: \uc774\ub825 \ud06c\uae30, \uc120\ud638 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\uac00 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The assessment framework encompasses\ndistinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to\nobjectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of\nphysiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine\nlearning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive\nutility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and\ninterval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection\nangle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to\nelucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various\nactivity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate\nthat the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with\nreference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust\nclassification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific\ndeterminants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the\npractical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring\nas well as psychophysiological state detection.

This paper evaluates PINNs'\ncapabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their\nperformance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three\nkey experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory\nprediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions\n(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we\ndemonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in\nerror reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic\ngrid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and\nexpert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic\nperformance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs\nconsistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical\napplications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a\nparadigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven\nflexibility with first-principles rigor.

Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic\nexemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs\nand data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align\ntheir general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of\nspecific tabular tasks.

Managing such massive data streams presents significant\nchallenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively\nexpensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data\nreduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making\nthem unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these\nchallenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized\nframework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on\nField-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to\ndynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing\nflexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability\nand accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines\nthe process of converting Python-based neural network models into\nSNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark\ncomparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple\nneural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis\nconfigurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL\nachieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in\nsome cases also offering FPGA resource savings.

We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively\ndistinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large\ndistribution shifts (Far-OOD).

Yang"], "title": "MoE-Health: A Mixture of Experts Framework for Robust Multimodal Healthcare Prediction", "comment": "Accepted to The 16th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational\n  Biology, and Health Informatics (ACM-BCB 2025)", "summary": "Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic\nHealth Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively\nleveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as\nreal-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing\napproaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection\nstrategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where\ndata availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework\ndesigned for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health\narchitecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing\nmodalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging\nspecialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach\ndynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data\nmodalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability\nscenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical\nclinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of\nstay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal\nfusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality\navailability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal\ninformation, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in\nhandling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly\nsuitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous\ndata availability.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoE-Health\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc735\ud569\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c Mixture of Experts \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MoE-Health\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ub3d9\uc801 \uac8c\uc774\ud305 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uad00\ub828 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MoE-Health\ub294 in-hospital \uc0ac\ub9dd \uc608\uce21, \ubcd1\uc6d0 \uc7a5\uae30 \uccb4\ub958, \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f MIMIC-IV \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc735\ud569 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MoE-Health\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHR), \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\ub840\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub610\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc120\ud0dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec, \ud658\uc790\uc640 \uae30\uad00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc735\ud569\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Mixture of Experts \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MoE-Health\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While forecasting mental health scores alone offers\nlimited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,\nquasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity\nDesign (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are\nmore likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the\nsize of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for\nanxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond\ntraditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future\ndiscontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear\ntrajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic\ncovariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static\nrepresentations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the\nanxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult\nbut more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the\nbest results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates.

We classify it in two key dimensions: source\nheterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and\nuser heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across\nindividuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific\ninformation, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their\nreal-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns\nlatent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream\npredictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.\nSpecifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source\nheterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user\nheterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term\nphysiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a\ndiscriminative representation space.

Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable\nparameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard\nLoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first\ninitialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation\nthat can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not\nalways easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from\nthe pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and\nthen express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --\ntraining only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on\nadaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE\ntasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,\nstandard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular\nvalue decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x\ncompared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "Large Language Models\uc758 \uc131\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574, \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.

To address both privacy\nand fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent\nIntervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational\nautoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular\ndata. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a\ntask-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus\noffering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\\'enyi\ndifferential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness\nin the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for\ngroup-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent\nspace, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across\nprotected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure\nextending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment\nencourages statistical independence between latent representations and the\nprotected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides\nsignificant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse\ndownstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLIP\ub294 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc640 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "GDPR \ubc0f HIPAA\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uaddc\uc81c\uac00 \uac15\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uac00\uc6b4\ub370, \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ubc1b\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "FLIP\ub294 \ubcc0\ud615\ub41c \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc640 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc885 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FLIP\uc740 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \ubb34\uad00 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FLIP\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uc720\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "GDPR \ubc0f HIPAA\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uaddc\uc81c\uc640 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ucc45\uc784 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AI \ubc95\uc548\uc774 \uac15\ud654\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc758\ub8cc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \ub418\ub294 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uac1c\uc785(FLIP)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c \ubcc0\ud615 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc774\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc124\uc815\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubb34\uad00 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 FLIP\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 R'enyi \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc(RDP) \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ube44\uc728\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc7a1\uc74c \uc218\uc900\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c RDP \ud638\ud658 \uade0\ud615 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\ub825 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ud638\ub41c \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04\uc758 \ub274\ub860 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)\uc744 \ud655\ub300\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uce21\uc815\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\ub82c\uc740 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ubcf4\ud638\ub41c \ud2b9\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 FLIP\uc774 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \ubb34\uad00 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}
