Existing datasets rely on human demonstrations, limiting scalability. A natural alternative is to synthesize data from strong CUAs, yet their rollouts are highly noisy, with incorrect or suboptimal actions consisting a large proportion of the steps, making naive imitation ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 100K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model. We train Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct models (7B and 32B) on WebSTAR. On WebVoyager, our 7B model surpasses SoTA open-source CUA model UI-TARS-1.5-7B by more than 15% with only supervised finetuning. Building on step-level grading, we further create WebSCORE, a dataset of graded step-level actions, and train StepRM, a 7B multimodal reward model distilled from o4-mini, which matches its grading quality while being far more efficient to deploy at scale. Our results establish step-level filtering as a key principle for scalable CUA training and construct two new datasets (WebSTAR, WebSCORE) and a lightweight reward model (StepRM) as practical tools to advance robust and efficient CUAs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac10\ub3c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub7ec\ube14\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 WebSTAR\uc640 WebSCORE\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 StepRM\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(CUA)\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ub192\uc740 GUI \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac10\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub7ec\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uc774\ub860 \ubcf4\uac15\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "WebSTAR \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 13.3K\uc758 \uada4\uc801\uacfc 100K\uc758 \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \ud569\uc131\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 SoTA \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 CUA \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 15% \uc774\uc0c1 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub7ec\ube14 CUA \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc6d0\uce59\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, WebSTAR, WebSCORE \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc StepRM \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(CUA)\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI) \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c CUA\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc778\ub370, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uace0, \uc798\ubabb\ub418\uac70\ub098 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ubaa8\ubc29\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac10\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub7ec\ube14\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud575\uc2ec \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub85c \uac01 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub9cc \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\uba70, \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860 \ubcf4\uac15\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec OpenAI\uc758 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubbf8\ub9ac\ubcf4\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud569\uc131\ub41c 13.3K \uada4\uc801 \ubc0f 100K \ub4f1\uae09\uc774 \ub9e4\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc774\ub860\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 WebSTAR \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 WebSTAR\uc5d0\uc11c Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct \ubaa8\ub378(7B \ubc0f 32B)\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, conventional fusion approaches often rely on simple concatenation of features, which cannot adaptively balance the contributions of biomarkers such as amyloid PET and MRI across brain regions. In this work, we propose MREF-AD, a Multimodal Regional Expert Fusion model for AD diagnosis. It is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that models meso-scale brain regions in each modality as an independent expert and employs two-level gating networks to learn subject-specific fusion weights. Beyond improving diagnostic performance, MREF-AD provides modality- and region-level insight into how structural and molecular imaging jointly contribute to disease diagnosis.

While multimodal deep learning models - leveraging facial expressions, speech, and textual cues - offer high accuracy in emotion recognition, their training and maintenance are often computationally intensive and inflexible to modality changes. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for training multimodal emotion recognition systems, where each modality encoder and the fusion classifier operate as autonomous agents coordinated by a central supervisor. This architecture enables modular integration of new modalities (e.g., audio features via emotion2vec), seamless replacement of outdated components, and reduced computational overhead during training. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation supporting vision, audio, and text modalities, with the classifier serving as a shared decision-making agent. Our framework not only improves training efficiency but also contributes to the design of more flexible, scalable, and maintainable perception modules for embodied and virtual agents in HAI scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uccb4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ub514\uc790\uc778\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc815\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc640 \uc735\ud569 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uac00 \uc911\uc559 \uac10\ub3c5\uad00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc870\uc815\ub418\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ube44\uc804, \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ubc0f \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, HAI \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ub41c \ubc0f \uac00\uc0c1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc720\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \uc6a9\uc774\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9(HAI)\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc815\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5bc\uad74 \ud45c\uc815, \uc74c\uc131 \ubc0f \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \uc720\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc640 \uc735\ud569 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uac00 \uc911\uc559 \uac10\ub3c5\uad00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc870\uc815\ub418\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0(\uc608: emotion2vec\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ud2b9\uc9d5)\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654\ub41c \ud1b5\ud569, \uad6c\uc2dd \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uad50\uccb4 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubd80\ud558 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc804, \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ubc0f \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c HAI \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \ubc0f \uac00\uc0c1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc720\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \uc6a9\uc774\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We design and implement a proof-of-concept LLVM-based optimization pipeline for the SPDZ protocol that addresses these bottlenecks. Our front end accepts a subset of C with lightweight privacy annotations and lowers it to LLVM IR, allowing us to reuse mature analyses and transformations to automatically batch independent arithmetic operations. Our back end performs data-flow and control-flow analysis on the optimized IR to drive a non-blocking runtime scheduler that overlaps independent operations and aggressively overlaps communication with computation; when enabled, it can map batched operations to GPU kernels. This design preserves a low learning curve by using a mainstream language and hiding optimization and hardware-specific mechanics from programmers. We evaluate the system on controlled microbenchmarks against MP-SPDZ, focusing on online phase performance. Our CPU back end achieves up to 5.56 times speedup under intermediate and heavy algebraic workloads, shows strong scaling with thread count, and our GPU back end scales better as the input size increases. Overall, these results indicate that leveraging LLVM with protocol-aware scheduling is an effective architectural direction for extracting parallelism without sacrificing usability.", "AI": {"tldr":

While recent methods excel at learning sparse coordination graphs-determining who communicates with whom-they do not address what information should be transmitted under hard bandwidth constraints. We study this bandwidth-limited regime and show that naive dimensionality reduction consistently degrades coordination performance. Hard bandwidth constraints force selective encoding, but deterministic projections lack mechanisms to control how compression occurs. We introduce Bandwidth-constrained Variational Message Encoding (BVME), a lightweight module that treats messages as samples from learned Gaussian posteriors regularized via KL divergence to an uninformative prior. BVME's variational framework provides principled, tunable control over compression strength through interpretable hyperparameters, directly constraining the representations used for decision-making. Across SMACv1, SMACv2, and MPE benchmarks, BVME achieves comparable or superior performance while using 67--83% fewer message dimensions, with gains most pronounced on sparse graphs where message quality critically impacts coordination. Ablations reveal U-shaped sensitivity to bandwidth, with BVME excelling at extreme ratios while adding minimal overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub178\ub4dc\ub85c, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \uc5e3\uc9c0\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\ubd84 \uac00\uc2dc\uc131 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \uc81c\ud55c \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc804\uc1a1\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud558\ub4dc \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \uc81c\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95 \uac1c\ubc1c.", "method": "Bandwith-constrained Variational Message Encoding (BVME) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec, \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c KL \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud6c4\ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09.", "result": "BVME\ub294 SMACv1, SMACv2 \ubc0f MPE \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c 67-83% \ub354 \uc801\uc740 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131.", "conclusion": "BVME\ub294 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc758 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uc728\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ucd94\uac00 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub178\ub4dc\ub85c, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \uc5e3\uc9c0\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\uc870\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub204\uac00 \uc11c\ub85c \ud1b5\uc2e0\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \ud611\uc870 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud558\ub4dc \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \uc81c\ud55c \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc804\uc1a1\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \uc81c\ud55c \uccb4\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c\uac00 \ud611\uc870 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ud558\ub4dc \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \uc81c\ud55c\uc740 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158\uc740 \uc555\ucd95\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 KL \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud6c4\ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc778 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \uc81c\uc57d \ubcc0\ubd84 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc778\ucf54\ub529(BVME)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

In this paper, we introduce the \"Planner-Executor-Perceptor (PEP)\" design paradigm and use it to systematically review existing work and identify the key challenges in this area. We also evaluate existing penetration testing systems, with a particular focus on the use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task. The results show that the out-of-the-box Claude Code and Sonnet 4.5 exhibit superior penetration capabilities observed to date, substantially outperforming all prior systems. However, a detailed analysis of their testing processes reveals specific strengths and limitations; notably, LLM agents struggle with maintaining coherent long-horizon plans, performing complex reasoning, and effectively utilizing specialized tools. These limitations significantly constrain its overall capability, efficiency, and stability. To address these limitations, we propose CHECKMATE, a framework that integrates enhanced classical planning with LLM agents, providing an external, structured \"brain\" that mitigates the inherent weaknesses of LLM agents. Our evaluation shows that CHECKMATE outperforms the state-of-the-art system (Claude Code) in penetration capability, improving benchmark success rates by over 20%. In addition, it delivers substantially greater stability, cutting both time and monetary costs by more than 50%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uad6c\ud604 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, CHECKMATE\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\ud604\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PEP \uc124\uacc4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uba74 \ucd94\uac00 \uad50\uc721 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FutureWeaver\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "FutureWeaver\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc608\uc0b0 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FutureWeaver\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc784\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uba74 \ucd94\uac00 \uad50\uc721 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1, \uc790\uae30 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc911 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ud560\ub2f9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacfc\uc81c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0, \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub97c \ud611\uc5c5 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ubd84\ubc30\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FutureWeaver\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing approaches excel at optimizing efficiency and enforcing safety constraints but lack mechanisms to ensure equitable service, resulting in systematic starvation of vehicles on low-demand approaches. We propose a hierarchical framework combining multi-objective reinforcement learning for local intersection control with strategic routing for network-level coordination. Our approach introduces a Conflict Threat Vector that provides agents with explicit risk signals for proactive conflict avoidance, and a queue parity penalty that ensures equitable service across all traffic streams. Extensive experiments on a real-world network across different robot vehicle (RV) penetration rates demonstrate substantial improvements: up to 53% reductions in average wait time, up to 86% reductions in maximum starvation, and up to 86\\% reduction in conflict rate compared to baselines, while maintaining fuel efficiency. Our analysis reveals that strategic routing effectiveness scales with RV penetration, becoming increasingly valuable at higher autonomy levels. The results demonstrate that multi-objective optimization through well-curated reward functions paired with strategic RV routing yields significant benefits in fairness and safety metrics critical for equitable mixed-autonomy deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud63c\ud569 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c

The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems. In this new paradigm, progress on the benchmark is progress on the science, thus reframing \"benchmarking\" as a vehicle for scientific advancement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc911\uc2ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, NanoGPT \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804\uc758 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "NanoGPT \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b, \ucc38\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubc0f \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud154\ub808\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5.", "result": "\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \uc9c4\ubcf4\uac00 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uc9c4\ubcf4\uc640 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub418\uc5b4, '\ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9'\uc744 \uacfc\ud559 \ubc1c\uc804\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac LLM\uc744 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc774\ubbf8 \ud574\uacb0\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c(\uc608: \uc218\ud559 \ub2e8\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c)\ub85c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc2b5\ub4dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc9c4\uc804\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ub354 \ud06c\uace0 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uceec\ub809\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud574 \uc654\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\ub824\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc1c\uc804\uc758 \uc885\ub958\ub97c \ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc9c4\ubcf4\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc778 \uc9c4\ubcf4 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uccab \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 NanoGPT \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4, \ucc38\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \ub3c4\uad6c, \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud154\ub808\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uac8c\uc784 \ubc29\uc9c0 \ud655\uc778\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ub2ec\uc131\ub41c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\uc778 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub461\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \uae30\ub85d\ubcf4\ub2e4 3\ucd08 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc744 \uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ucc30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\uad50\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8\uac83\ub4e4\uc740 \uc218\ub2e8\uc774\uc9c0 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2d9\ub2c8\ub2e4;

However, the inherent unreliability of LLMs introduces fundamental security risks when these agents operate over sensitive user services. Prior approaches either rely on manually written policies that require security expertise, or place LLMs in the confinement loop, which lacks rigorous security guarantees. We present MiniScope, a framework that enables tool calling agents to operate on user accounts while confining potential damage from unreliable LLMs. MiniScope introduces a novel way to automatically and rigorously enforce least privilege principles by reconstructing permission hierarchies that reflect relationships among tool calls and combining them with a mobile-style permission model to balance security and ease of use. To evaluate MiniScope, we create a synthetic dataset derived from ten popular real-world applications, capturing the complexity of realistic agentic tasks beyond existing simplified benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that MiniScope incurs only 1-6% latency overhead compared to vanilla tool calling agents, while significantly outperforming the LLM based baseline in minimizing permissions as well as computational and operational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiniScope\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacc4\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c LLM\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc2dc \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc791\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MiniScope\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uad8c\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \uad8c\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc18c \ud2b9\uad8c \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MiniScope\ub294 10\uac1c\uc758 \uc778\uae30 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc120 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MiniScope\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 1-6%\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub9cc\uc744 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uad8c\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 LLM \ubc30\ud3ec\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c, ChatGPT, Claude \ubc0f Gemini\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc774 \uc5f0\uacb0\uae30 \ubc0f \uc790\uc728 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LLM\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubd80\uc871\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \ub54c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub41c \ud658\uacbd \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0 LLM\uc744 \ubc30\uce58\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MiniScope\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacc4\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c LLM\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.

Automating this process is challenging due to modeling errors, fragile code, and misaligned objectives, which often impede policy training. We introduce an agentic large language model (LLM)-based framework for automated MDP modeling and policy generation (A-LAMP), that automatically translates free-form natural language task descriptions into an MDP formulation and trained policy. The framework decomposes modeling, coding, and training into verifiable stages, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline. Across both classic control and custom RL domains, A-LAMP consistently achieves higher policy generation capability than a single state-of-the-art LLM model. Notably, even its lightweight variant, which is built on smaller language models, approaches the performance of much larger models. Failure analysis reveals why these improvements occur. In addition, a case study also demonstrates that A-LAMP generates environments and policies that preserve the task's optimality, confirming its correctness and reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "A-LAMP\ub294 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c MDP\uc640 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec RL \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc124\uba85\uc744 MDP\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c A-LAMP\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785.", "result": "A-LAMP\ub294 \uace0\uc804 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 RL \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "A-LAMP\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub824\uba74 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ub9c8\ub974 \ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(MDP)\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uba70 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc624\ub958, \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b0\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc815\ucc45 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc124\uba85\uc744 MDP \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 A-LAMP\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \ucf54\ub529 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\uc804 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 RL \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c A-LAMP\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ucc45 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubcc0\ud615\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud328 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 A-LAMP\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We focus on mixed-motive social dilemmas instantiated as a \\textit{Tragedy of the Commons} environment from the Melting Pot suite, where we systematically compare human groups and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents, each evaluated with and without explicit communication. Cooperative resilience is assessed under a continuously disruptive condition induced by a persistent unsustainable consumption bot, together with intermittent environmental shocks implemented as stochastic removal of shared resources across scenarios. This experimental design establishes a benchmark for cooperative resilience across agent architectures and interaction modalities, constituting a key step toward systematically comparing humans and LLM-based agents. Using this framework, we find that human groups with communication achieve the highest cooperative resilience compared to all other groups. Communication also improves the resilience of LLM agents, but their performance remains below human levels. Motivated by the performance of humans, we further examine a long-horizon setting with harsher environmental conditions, where humans sustain the shared resource and maintain high resilience in diverse disruption scenarios. Together, these results suggest that human decision-making under adverse social conditions can inform the design of artificial agents that promote prosocial and resilient behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr":

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Insight Miner}, a large-scale multimodal model (LMM) designed to generate high-quality, comprehensive time-series descriptions enriched with domain-specific knowledge. To facilitate this, we introduce \\textbf{TS-Insights}\\footnote{Available at \\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhykoties/time-series-language-alignment}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhykoties/time-series-language-alignment}.}, the first general-domain dataset for time series and language alignment. TS-Insights contains 100k time-series windows sampled from 20 forecasting datasets. We construct this dataset using a novel \\textbf{agentic workflow}, where we use statistical tools to extract features from raw time series before synthesizing them into coherent trend descriptions with GPT-4. Following instruction tuning on TS-Insights, Insight Miner outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal models, such as LLaVA \\citep{liu2023llava} and GPT-4, in generating time-series descriptions and insights.

Sullivan", "Wenting Zheng", "Dimitrios Skarlatos"], "title": "A Scalable Multi-GPU Framework for Encrypted Large-Model Inference", "comment": null, "summary": "Encrypted AI using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) provides strong privacy guarantees; but its slow performance has limited practical deployment. Recent works proposed ASICs to accelerate FHE, but require expensive advanced manufacturing processes that constrain their accessibility. GPUs are a far more accessible platform, but achieving ASIC-level performance using GPUs has remained elusive. Furthermore, state-of-the-art approaches primarily focus on small models that fit comfortably within a single device. Supporting large models such as LLMs in FHE introduces a dramatic increase in computational complexity that requires optimized GPU kernels, along with managing terabyte-scale memory footprints that far exceed the capacity of a single GPU. This paper presents Cerium, a multi-GPU framework for FHE inference on large models. Cerium integrates a domain-specific language, an optimizing compiler, and a runtime system to automatically generate high-performance GPU kernels, manage terabyte-scale memory footprints, and parallelize computation across multiple GPUs. It introduces new IR constructs, compiler passes, sparse polynomial representations, memory-efficient data layouts, and communication-aware parallelization techniques that together enable encrypted inference for models ranging from small CNNs to Llama3-8B. We build Cerium on NVIDIA GPUs and demonstrate significant performance gains. For small models, Cerium outperforms expert-written hand-optimized GPU libraries by up to 2.25 times. Cerium achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art FHE ASICs, outright matching prior FHE ASIC CraterLake.

To address these limitations, we present TriFlow, a progressive multi-agent framework that unifies structured reasoning and language-based flexibility through a three-stage pipeline of retrieval, planning, and governance. By this design, TriFlow progressively narrows the search space, assembles constraint-consistent itineraries via rule-LLM collaboration, and performs bounded iterative refinement to ensure global feasibility and personalisation.

However, current evaluation practices remain fragmented across isolated benchmarks, making it difficult to assess whether today's foundation models truly generalize beyond their training distributions. We introduce MultiNet v1.0, a unified benchmark for measuring the cross domain generality of vision language models (VLMs) and vision language action models (VLAs) across six foundational capability regimes. Visual grounding, spatial reasoning, tool use, physical commonsense, multi agent coordination, and continuous robot control. Evaluating GPT 5, Pi0, and Magma, we find that no model demonstrates consistent generality. All exhibit substantial degradation on unseen domains, unfamiliar modalities, or cross domain task shifts despite strong performance within their training distributions.These failures manifest as modality misalignment, output format instability, and catastrophic knowledge degradation under domain transfer.Our findings reveal a persistent gap between the aspiration of generalist intelligence and the actual capabilities of current foundation models.MultiNet v1.0 provides a standardized evaluation substrate for diagnosing these gaps and guiding the development of future generalist agents.Code, data, and leaderboards are publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "Multinet v1.0\uc740 \ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uad50\ucc28 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0b0\ubc1c\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uae30\ucd08, \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9, \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc0c1\uc2dd, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub4f1 6\uac1c \uae30\ubcf8 \ub2a5\ub825 \uccb4\uacc4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 VLM\uacfc VLA\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GPT 5, Pi0, Magma \ubaa8\ub378 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc77c\ubc18\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd84\ud3ec \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf8 \uc801 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc774\ub098 \uc775\uc219\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uae30\ub300\uc640 \ud604\uc7ac \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub2a5\ub825 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

A plausible approach to protecting this metadata is to have senders post encrypted messages on a public bulletin board and receivers scan it for relevant messages. Oblivious message retrieval (OMR) leverages homomorphic encryption (HE) to improve user experience in this solution by delegating the scan to a resource-rich server while preserving privacy. A key process in OMR is the homomorphic detection of pertinent messages for the receiver from the bulletin board. It relies on a specialized matrix-vector multiplication algorithm, which involves extensive multiplications between ciphertext vectors and plaintext matrices, as well as homomorphic rotations. The computationally intensive nature of this process limits the practicality of OMR. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a hardware architecture to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplication algorithm. The building homomorphic operators in this algorithm are implemented using high-level synthesis, with design parameters for different parallelism levels. These operators are then deployed on a field-programmable gate array platform using an efficient design space exploration strategy to accelerate homomorphic matrix-vector multiplication.

However, existing tools rely on fixed optimization strategies inherited from software compilations, limiting their effectiveness. Tailoring optimization strategies to specific designs requires deep semantic understanding, accurate hardware metric estimation, and advanced search algorithms -- capabilities that current approaches lack.\n  We propose DAPO, a design structure-aware pass ordering framework that extracts program semantics from control and data flow graphs, employs contrastive learning to generate rich embeddings, and leverages an analytical model for accurate hardware metric estimation. These components jointly guide a reinforcement learning agent to discover design-specific optimization strategies.

While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

MKL seeks an optimal linear combination of base kernels that maximizes a generalized performance measure under a regularization constraint. Various norms have been used to regularize the kernel weights, including $l1$, $l2$ and $lp$, as well as the \"elastic-net\" penalty, which combines $l1$- and $l2$-norm to promote both sparsity and the selection of correlated kernels. This property makes elastic-net regularized MKL (ENMKL) especially valuable when model interpretability is critical and kernels capture correlated information, such as in neuroimaging. Previous ENMKL methods have followed a two-stage procedure: fix kernel weights, train a support vector machine (SVM) with the weighted kernel, and then update the weights via gradient descent, cutting-plane methods, or surrogate functions. Here, we introduce an alternative ENMKL formulation that yields a simple analytical update for the kernel weights. We derive explicit algorithms for both SVM and kernel ridge regression (KRR) under this framework, and implement them in the open-source Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). We evaluate these ENMKL algorithms against $l1$-norm MKL and against SVM (or KRR) trained on the unweighted sum of kernels across three neuroimaging applications. Our results show that ENMKL matches or outperforms $l1$-norm MKL in all tasks and only underperforms standard SVM in one scenario. Crucially, ENMKL produces sparser, more interpretable models by selectively weighting correlated kernels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ucee4\ub110 \ud559\uc2b5(MKL) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud45c\ud604\uc774\ub098 \uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc801 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ucee4\ub110 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uac31\uc2e0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 ENMKL \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 sSVM \ub610\ub294 KRR\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ENMKL\uc774 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc601\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ucee4\ub110 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucee4\ub110 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc801 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c SVM \ubc0f \ucee4\ub110 \ub9bf\uc9c0 \ud68c\uadc0(KRR) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "ENMKL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 $l1$-\uc815\uaddc\ud654 MKL \ubc0f SVM(KRR)\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 ENMKL\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c $l1$-\uc815\uaddc\ud654 MKL\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ud45c\uc900 SVM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub3c4 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ucee4\ub110 \ud559\uc2b5(MKL) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubc0f \ube44\uac10\ub3c5 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ucee4\ub110\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud45c\ud604 \ub610\ub294 \uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

Current models, however, are often trained using a mask-and-reconstruct objective on small brain regions. This focus on low-level information leads to representations that are sensitive to noise and temporal fluctuations, necessitating extensive fine-tuning for downstream tasks. We introduce Brain-Semantoks, a self-supervised framework designed specifically to learn abstract representations of brain dynamics. Its architecture is built on two core innovations: a semantic tokenizer that aggregates noisy regional signals into robust tokens representing functional networks, and a self-distillation objective that enforces representational stability across time. We show that this objective is stabilized through a novel training curriculum, ensuring the model robustly learns meaningful features from low signal-to-noise time series. We demonstrate that learned representations enable strong performance on a variety of downstream tasks even when only using a linear probe. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive scaling analyses indicating more unlabeled data reliably results in out-of-distribution performance gains without domain adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr":

Addressing the common challenges of model collapse and training instability in reasoning adaptation, we propose a comprehensive, reproducible training recipe spanning system, data, and algorithmic optimizations. Our approach combines memory-efficient infrastructure for 64K-token contexts using hybrid parallelism and kernel-level optimizations with a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that mitigates distribution mismatch through verified, aligned synthetic data. Furthermore, we detail a robust Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) pipeline that stabilizes training via difficulty-aware data filtering and mixed-policy trajectory reuse.

We introduce Atomic Action Slicing (AAS), a planner-aligned approach that decomposes long-horizon demonstrations into short, typed atomic actions that are easier for planners to use and policies to learn. Using LIBERO demonstrations, AAS produces a validated dataset of 2,124 atomic segments labeled with action type, temporal span, and confidence. A stronger segmenter (Gemini 2.5 Pro) closely matches planner-defined plans and remains robust under keyframe jitter, while smaller models perform worse on multi-object tasks. Fine-tuning CLIP-RT+ on our atomic dataset improves task success from 94.2% to 95.3% on LIBERO-Goal and 83.8% to 88.8% on LIBERO-Long.

Here, we verify the scientific knowledge on agroecological crop protection that is generated by either web-grounded or non-grounded large language models (LLMs), i.e., DeepSeek versus the free-tier version of ChatGPT. For nine globally limiting pests, weeds, and plant diseases, we assessed the factual accuracy, data consistency, and breadth of knowledge or data completeness of each LLM. Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT. As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics. However, both models hallucinated, i.e., fabricated fictitious agents or references, reported on implausible ecological interactions or outcomes, confused old and new scientific nomenclatures, and omitted data on key agents or solutions. Despite these shortcomings, both LLMs correctly reported low-resolution efficacy trends. Overall, when paired with rigorous human oversight, LLMs may pose a powerful tool to support farm-level decision-making and unleash scientific creativity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0dd\uc131\uc801

Prior research has uncovered isolated cases of bias, particularly against English Language Learners (ELLs) however, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of such systems across broader sociolinguistic factors. In this work, we propose BAID, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI detectors across various types of biases. As a part of the framework, we introduce over 200k samples spanning 7 major categories: demographics, age, educational grade level, dialect, formality, political leaning, and topic. We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups. Our contributions provide a scalable, transparent approach for auditing AI detectors and emphasize the need for bias-aware evaluation before these tools are deployed for public use.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc0dd\uc131 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c BAID \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, 200,000\uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\ud1a0\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \uc800\uc870\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc0dd\uc131 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \ubc0f \uc804\ubb38 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc601\uc5b4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uba70 \uc774\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "BAID\ub77c\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, 7\uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 200,000\uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\uc704 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\ubb38 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "4\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 AI \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc18c\uc678\ub41c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uc758 \uac10\uc0ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uacf5\uacf5 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc0dd\uc131 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \uad50\uc721 \ubc0f \uc804\ubb38 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc601\uc5b4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790(ELL)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc758 \ub2e8\uae30\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840\ub4e4\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \ube44\uad50\uc801 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc5b8\uc5b4\ud559\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c AI \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 BAID\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc77c\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uad6c\ud1b5\uacc4, \uc5f0\ub839, \uad50\uc721 \uc218\uc900, \ubc29\uc5b8, \ud615\uc2dd\uc131, \uc815\uce58\uc801 \uc131\ud5a5, \uc8fc\uc81c\uc758 7\uac1c \uc8fc\uc694 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 20\ub9cc \uac1c \uc774\uc0c1 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud558\uc704 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\ubb38 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc8fc\uc758 \uae4a\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub85c \uac01 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 4\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 AI \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc18c\uc678\ub41c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub0ae\uc740 \uc7ac\ud604\uc728\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 AI \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uc758 \uac10\uc0ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uacf5\uacf5 \uc6a9\ub3c4\ub85c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc778\uc2dd \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Greenwashing, i.e., misleading corporate sustainability claims, poses a major challenge to environmental progress. To address this challenge, we introduce EmeraldMind, a fact-centric framework integrating a domain-specific knowledge graph with retrieval-augmented generation to automate greenwashing detection. EmeraldMind builds the EmeraldGraph from diverse corporate ESG (environmental, social, and governance) reports, surfacing verifiable evidence, often missing in generic knowledge bases, and supporting large language models in claim assessment. The framework delivers justification-centric classifications, presenting transparent, evidence-backed verdicts and abstaining responsibly when claims cannot be verified. Experiments on a new greenwashing claims dataset demonstrate that EmeraldMind achieves competitive accuracy, greater coverage, and superior explanation quality compared to generic LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "EmeraldMind\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 ESG \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uadf8\ub9b0\uc6cc\uc2f1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uacbd \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uc640 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "EmeraldMind\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\uc5c5 ESG \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c EmeraldGraph\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ubc1c\uad74\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc7a5 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, \uccad\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18\uc778 \ud310\uacb0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 EmeraldMind\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ub354 \ud070 \ubc94\uc704, \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc124\uba85 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18 LLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EmeraldMind\ub294 \uadf8\ub9b0\uc6cc\uc2f1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815\uc774\ub098 \uc7ac\uad50\uc721 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI\uc640 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ud3b8\ud654\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ub178\ub825\uacfc \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9b0\uc6cc\uc2f1, \uc989 \uc624\ud574\ub97c \ubd88\ub7ec\uc77c\uc73c\ud0a4\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ub4e4\uc740 \ud658\uacbd \uc9c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uadf8\ub9b0\uc6cc\uc2f1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc640 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc911\uc2ec \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 EmeraldMind\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies.
