Prompt injection attacks\ncan cause LLMs to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, and exhibit\nharmful behaviors. To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a\nlocally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are\nevaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a \"defense attorney\"\nmodel argues the prompt is benign, a \"prosecution attorney\" model argues the\nprompt is a prompt injection, and a \"judge\" model gives the final\nclassification. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate than the Direct\nDetector, an LLM as-a-judge. However, CourtGuard is generally a worse prompt\ninjection detector. Nevertheless, this lower false positive rate highlights the\nimportance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios for the\nclassification of a prompt. Additionally, the relative performance of\nCourtGuard in comparison to other prompt injection classifiers advances the use\nof multiagent systems as a defense against prompt injection attacks.

The introduction of the MCP has further enhanced AI\nintegration by standardizing communication between AI systems and external data\nsources. Despite these advancements, there is still no standardized method for\nseamlessly integrating LLM applications and blockchain. To address this\nconcern, we propose \"MCC: Model Context Contracts\" a novel framework that\nenables LLMs to interact directly with blockchain smart contracts through\nMCP-like protocol. This integration allows AI agents to invoke blockchain smart\ncontracts, facilitating more dynamic and context-aware interactions between\nusers and blockchain networks. Essentially, it empowers users to interact with\nblockchain systems and perform transactions using queries in natural language.\nWithin this proposed architecture, blockchain smart contracts can function as\nintelligent agents capable of recognizing user input in natural language and\nexecuting the corresponding transactions. To ensure that the LLM accurately\ninterprets natural language inputs and maps them to the appropriate MCP\nfunctions, the LLM was fine-tuned using a custom dataset comprising user inputs\npaired with their corresponding MCP server functions. This fine-tuning process\nsignificantly improved the platform's performance and accuracy. To validate the\neffectiveness of MCC, we have developed an end-to-end prototype implemented on\nthe Rahasak blockchain with the fine-tuned Llama-4 LLM.

Operating in dynamic\non-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app\ninteractions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector:\nenvironmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual\ninstructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by\ninserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed\nnotifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can\nderail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible\ndevice compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce\nGhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under\nenvironmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving\nbeyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events\ninto realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators\nand evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a\njudge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the\nagent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence,\npinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive\nexperiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to\ndeceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive\nand reason about manipulated UIs.

It allows them to apply deep learning by fine-tuning\nmodels at a fraction of the cost of training a brand-new model. However, model\nsharing exposes end-users to cyber threats that leverage the models for\nmalicious purposes. Attackers can use model sharing by hiding self-executing\nmalware inside neural network parameters and then distributing them for\nunsuspecting users to unknowingly directly execute them, or indirectly as a\ndependency in another software. In this work, we propose NeuPerm, a simple yet\neffec- tive way of disrupting such malware by leveraging the theoretical\nproperty of neural network permutation symmetry.

C2C\nenables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving\ntask understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic\ncoding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17\nagents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The\nresults show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with\nacceptable communication costs.

Specifically, AdaDoS models\nthe problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to\nobstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to\nidentify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting\nits attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector.\nAdditionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than\ndefenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov\ndecision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay\ninformation between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a\nnovel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited\nobservations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who\nhas full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents\nthe first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of\nadaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack\ndetectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaDoS\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 DoS \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ud68c\ud53c\ud558\uba70 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 DoS \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, AI \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ubd88\uac70\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AdaDoS\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc640 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, SDN\uacfc \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, POMDP\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub9cc \uac16\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud559\uc0dd \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uad50\uc0ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "AdaDoS\ub294 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubc0f \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 DoS \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AdaDoS\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac DoS \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc11c\uba85\uacfc \uc815\uc801 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc131 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uac70\ubd80(DoS) \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 AI \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 SDN \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 AdaDoS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating\noptimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces\ntwo major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local\ndeployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks\nhave spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more\nlightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs\ncan achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can\nmatch LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to\nsuboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented\ngeneration framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.\nReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning\ngraph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and\nleverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration.

This is because of its\nincentive incompatibility and susceptibility to bribery attacks.\n  State-of-the-art solutions such as MAD-HTLC (Oakland'21) and He-HTLC\n(NDSS'23) address this by leveraging miners' profit-driven behaviour to\nmitigate such attacks. The former is the mitigation against passive miners;\nhowever, the latter works against both active and passive miners. However, they\nconsider only two bribing scenarios where either of the parties involved in the\ntransfer collude with the miner.\n  In this paper, we expose vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art solutions by\npresenting a miner-collusion bribery attack with implementation and\ngame-theoretic analysis. Additionally, we propose a stronger attack on MAD-HTLC\nthan He-HTLC, allowing the attacker to earn profits equivalent to attacking\nnaive HTLC.\n  Leveraging our insights, we propose \\prot, a game-theoretically secure HTLC\nprotocol resistant to all bribery scenarios. \\prot\\ employs a two-phase\napproach, preventing unauthorized token confiscation by third parties, such as\nminers. In Phase 1, parties commit to the transfer; in Phase 2, the transfer is\nexecuted without manipulation. We demonstrate \\prot's efficiency in transaction\ncost and latency via implementations on Bitcoin and Ethereum.", "AI": {"tldr": "HTLC(\ud574\uc2dc \uc2dc\uac04 \uc7a0\uae08 \uacc4\uc57d)\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c\uc11c, miner-collusion \ub1cc\ubb3c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 HTLC \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc778 \\prot\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "HTLC\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc758\ubb38\uc2dc\ub418\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \ube44\uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ub1cc\ubb3c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 miner-collusion \ub1cc\ubb3c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \\prot\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 HTLC \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \\prot\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub1cc\ubb3c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70, \ube44\ud2b8\ucf54\uc778\uacfc \uc774\ub354\ub9ac\uc6c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac70\ub798 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HTLC \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \\prot\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c3\uc790\uc758 \ubb34\ub2e8 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc555\uc218\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Hashed Time-Locked Contracts(HTLC)\uc758 \uc778\uae30\uac00 \uc9c0\ubd88 \ucc44\ub110, \uc6d0\uc790\uc801 \uc2a4\uc651 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uac70\ub798\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc758\ubb38\uc2dc\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc640 \ub1cc\ubb3c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.

Information fusion has gone from being conceived as a\npurely hierarchical procedure, as is the case of traditional military\napplications, to now being regarded collaboratively, as holonic fusion, which\nis better suited for civil applications and edge organizations. The above\nparadigm shift is being boosted as information fusion gains ground in different\nnon-military areas, and human-computer and machine-machine communications,\nwhere holarchies, which are more flexible structures than ordinary, static\nhierarchies, become more widespread. This paper focuses on showing how holonic\nstructures tend to be generated when there are constraints on resources\n(energy, available messages, time, etc.) for interactions based on a set of\nfully intercommunicating elements (peers) whose components fuse information as\na means of optimizing the impact of vagueness and uncertainty present message\nexchanges. Holon formation is studied generically based on a multiagent system\nmodel, and an example of its possible operation is shown. Holonic structures\nhave a series of advantages, such as adaptability, to sudden changes in the\nenvironment or its composition, are somewhat autonomous and are capable of\ncooperating in order to achieve a common goal.

The final Version of Record will appear in the\n  official conference proceedings", "summary": "Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local\nspecialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a\npromising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to\nchallenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many\nacademic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting\ntheir transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an\nenhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two\nexisting benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling\nscenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control\nstrategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic\nagent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action\nmasking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to\nlearn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When\naction masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the\nperformance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role\nof action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization\ndiminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides\na valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions\nin industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on\ncentralization versus specialization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uacf5\uc815\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c

This\nmismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade\nperformance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model\nmisspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of\nuncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture\nthe directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a\nnovel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and\nexplicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,\nenabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on\nsingle-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves\nsuperior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,\noffering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d8\ub9bd\ud2f1 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7ac\ubb34 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uac70\ub798 \ud658\uacbd \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d8\ub9bd\ud2f1 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ubc0f \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ub2eb\ud78c \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ud574\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e8\uc77c \uc790\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc790\uc0b0 \uac70\ub798 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc0e4\ud504 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac70\ub798\ub7c9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud574\ub3c4 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc7ac\ubb34 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c RL \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucda9\uc2e4\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7ac\ubb34 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uba70, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uac00\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubc30\uce58 \uc911, \uc774\ub4e4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uac70\ub798\uac00 \uc790\uc0b0 \uac00\uaca9\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\ub798\ub97c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc601\ud5a5 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \ubc30\uce58 \ud658\uacbd \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac15\uac74 RL \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0ac\uc591 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc601\ud5a5\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uce6d \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d8\ub9bd\ud2f1 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ubc0f \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ub2eb\ud78c \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ud574\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac15\uac74 \uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c \uc790\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc790\uc0b0 \uac70\ub798 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc0e4\ud504 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac70\ub798\ub7c9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c RL\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucda9\uc2e4\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,\nand Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask\nquestions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain\ncontext-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA\ntranslates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our\nprototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying\nfeatures. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the\nbaseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and\ninteractive refinement.

To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought\ncommunication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to\ntelepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize\nthe process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are\ngenerated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a\nnonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private\nlatent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the\nglobal structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which\nthoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with\ntheoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a\nframework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication\nand assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing\npatterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as\nmost observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate\nthe collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work\nilluminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges\nremain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of\ncompute or data scale.",

However, their\napplication to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.\nWhile reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing\nthese challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,\noutcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for\ngroup-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all\nactions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal\npolicies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across\nmulti-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel\nand lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,\nderived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph\nfrom trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality\nof each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as\na plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL\nalgorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing\nnegligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,\nALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that\nSALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to\nvalidate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.", "AI": {"tldr": "SALT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacbd\ub7c9

By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward\nartificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition\nfrom open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,\nrefusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable\nand resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known\nphenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset\ndetection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral\nconsolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities\nare not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance\ntrade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale\nmodels, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models.

We close this gap by\nintroducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal\ndiscovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES\nor GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design\nyields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the\nopponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,\nwith high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To\nthe best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in\nexplaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs\n(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching\ntheory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,\nDream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while\nremaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as\nHepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these\nresults establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are\nsimultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,\nmarking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous\nfinite-sample theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc720\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec DDQN \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\uc120(GES \ub610\ub294 GraN-DAG)\uacfc \uc9c1\uc811 \uacbd\uc7c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uac00 \uc5b8\uc81c\ub098 \ub300\ud56d\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc5f4\ub4f1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \ub530\ub73b\ud55c \uc2dc\uc791\uc774 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \ud655\ub960\uc774 \ub192\ub2e4\ub294 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c GES\uc640 GraN-DAG\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uaca9\ucc28\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4.

In this paper, we examine\nevolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D\nsliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic\nelements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term\nplanning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a\ntwo-agent metaprompting system where a \"thinker\" large language model (LLM)\nagent refines gameplay strategies for an \"executor\" LLM agent, and a\nsingle-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte\nCarlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid\nperformance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary\nrefinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic\nenvironments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with\nan average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends\n(correlation $\\rho$=0.607) across training cycles.

However, how\nstructural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to\ninfluence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume\nof longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a\nmulti-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture\nconstrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution\nof SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical\nareas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger\nrole in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC\nversus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in\nearly AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and\nFC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of\nAD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal\nfunction, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In\nparallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and\nbiological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau\npropagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional\npathways in a region-specific manner.

The benchmark examples we\nuse are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.\nWe consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of\nalternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and\nabstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.\nThe generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by\nsymbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that\nGPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple\nsettings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the\nassociated fluents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubaa9\uc801\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc758 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 PDDL\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \uba85\uc2dc\ub41c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \ub0b4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85 \uc81c\uacf5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "PDDL\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \uba85\uc2dc\ub41c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1 PDDL \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubc0f \ubb38\uc81c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc608\uc81c\uac00 LLM\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c, GPT-4o\uac00 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GPT-4o\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub354 \ub2a5\uc219\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc720\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub294 \ub35c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubaa9\uc801\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc758 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85 \uc81c\uacf5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 PDDL\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \uba85\uc2dc\ub41c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uc0c1 PDDL \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \ubb38\uc81c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub9e5\ub77d \ub0b4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc608\uc81c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub86d\uace0 LLM\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc801\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uccb4 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801 \ub3d9\uc791\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654, \uad6c\uccb4\uc801 \ub3d9\uc791\uc758 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub3d9\uc791/\uc18d\uc131 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654, \ubc0f \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc94\uc8fc\uc758 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ucd94\uc0c1 PDDL \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \ubb38\uc81c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub294 \uae30\ud638 \uac80\uc99d \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 GPT-4o\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub098 \uad00\ub828 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4."}}

Routine\nlaboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their\nutility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the\nsevere class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses\nthe feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever\nLifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the\ngrouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A\ncomprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126\nanalytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature\nselection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the\npatient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression\nclassifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated\nmoderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical\nclassification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).\nWhile a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall\n(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis\nwith SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven\nby non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia.

Existing\nmethods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions\nwithout explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and\nresults in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective\nresponses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates\nexternal tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more\nuseful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better\nexploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining\nadditional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more\naccurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's\nability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA\ndata generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks\nwith reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,\nwe collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a\ntraining set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping\nwith the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on\nEQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by\n9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot\nToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench\ndatasets, demonstrating its generality.

Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single\nconsensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard\naggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,\noperates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the\nactual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in\nsuboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that\ndynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL\nperforms a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies\nand prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data\nsubspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative\naggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.\nFurthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization\nstability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization\nmechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively\nmitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local\nperformance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable\nupdates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,\nCINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,\nscalability and convergence stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(PFL)\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud569\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc801\ud569\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uc5ec \uc911\uc2ec PFL(CO-PFL)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec, \uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uc138\uacc4\uc801 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CO-PFL\uc740 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcc0\ubcc4\uc801\uc778 \uc9d1\ud569 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub9de\ucda4\ud654 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CO-PFL\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \uac15\uac74\uc131, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc218\ub834 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(PFL)\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud569\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd80\uc801\ud569\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \ud45c\uc900 \uc9d1\ud569 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\ud558\uac8c \ub610\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc591\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uc640 \uc9d1\ud569 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 \uae30\uc5ec \uc911\uc2ec PFL(CO-PFL)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

A major barrier is the quality\nand fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data\ncollection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging\nproject, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect\nbiases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias\nacross multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and\nmeasurement biases.

For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete\nfailing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both\nthe validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding\nassistant deployments.\n  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,\na benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to\nexploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates \"impossible\" variants of tasks from\nexisting benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct\nconflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We\nmeasure an agent's \"cheating rate\" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,\nwhere any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.\n  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a\nversatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,\nrevealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test\nmodification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing\nhow prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)\ndeveloping monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive\nsolutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building\nmore robust and reliable LLM systems.\n  Our implementation can be found at\nhttps://github.com/safety-research/impossiblebench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\ucd95\ud0a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 ImpossibleBench\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4 \uc545\uc6a9 \uc131\ud5a5\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc545\uc6a9\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \ucf54\ub4dc \ubc30\ud3ec\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \uc800\ud574\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "ImpossibleBench\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc591\uacfc \ub2e8\uc704 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c '\ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c' \uacfc\uc81c \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 '\uc18d\uc784\uc218 \ube44\uc728'\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ImpossibleBench\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc18d\uc784\uc218 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc18d\uc784\uc218 \ube44\uc728\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ub3c4\uad6c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc \uc81c\uacf5 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ImpossibleBench\uac00 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\uae30\ub97c \ud76c\ub9dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5c5\ubb34\ub97c \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \"\uc9c0\ub984\uae38\"\uc744 \ucc3e\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \ub2e8\uc704 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubc84\uadf8\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ad\uc81c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c LLM \ucf54\ub529 \ubc30\uce58\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ImpossibleBench\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of\nrecent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically\nanalyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology\nengineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.\n  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual\nfoundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two\ncomplementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,\nnormalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight\nflexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize\nrepresentative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify\ntheir limitations.\n  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,\nincluding KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic\nsystems, and multimodal KG construction.

Despite its ability to capture\nrich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing\nthis measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational\ndemands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of\nrandom walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging\napproximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the\nother sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear\ntime and provide strong approximation guarantees.

Recently, growing attention has been given\nto combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,\nforming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing\nmethods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to\nreliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds.

Unlike conventional RL,\nwhich optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to\nencode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any\nobjective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite\ngrowing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.\n  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation\nintroduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing\napproaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework\nis the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,\nwhich learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional\nrepresentations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure\nof the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles\nand key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for\nsuccessor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in\nthe zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our\nframework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL\nand outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uccab \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uad50\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud568.", "motivation": "\uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "\uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uc77c\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801 \ubc0f \uc870\ud569\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud568.", "result": "\uacf5\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub860\uacfc \ubc29\ubc95 \uac04\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \ud6c4\uc18d \ud2b9\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uacf5\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ucd94\uac00 \uad50\uc721\uc774\ub098 \uacc4\ud68d \uc5c6\uc774 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 RL\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \uacf5\ud1b5\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \ud2c0\uc744 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 RL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud45c\uae30\ubc95\uacfc \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac00\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ub9e4\ud551\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc870\ud569 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub25c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc29\ubc95 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc6d0\uce59\uacfc \uc8fc\uc694 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ud6c4\uc18d \ud2b9\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uacf5\ud1b5\uc758 \uc2dc\uc120 \uc544\ub798 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 RL\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While elegant, this definition assumes\n\\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset\nfailure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect\n\\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential\ndomains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of\ngeneralized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This\nformulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the\nresulting \\textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under\nvarying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards\nspecialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain\ndependency.

The\nkey challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality\nwhile learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on\nthe cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal\ndistributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct\nmeaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)\nmixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the\nmost prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates\nincreasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we\npropose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically\nachieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation\nlearning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality\nfollows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP\nto calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows\nDP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most\nprominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating\nmultimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.\nAblation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning\nmodality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.\nCode is anonymously available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/DPMM.git", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc735\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 Dirichlet \uacfc\uc815 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uac01 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc735\ud569 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Dirichlet \uacfc\uc815 \ud63c\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378(DP)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc99d\ub300\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Ablation \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 DP\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \uc8fc\uc694 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc735\ud569 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc758\ub8cc \ubc0f \uae08\uc735\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \uac01 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \uc8fc\ubcc0 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uac15\uc870\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uac01 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This, in turn, poses a challenge for\ndeep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a\nbiologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most\nexciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and\nadversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nreconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual\ncortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded\nneurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers\nof the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can\nreconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500\nneurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified\nbenchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results\ndemonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and\nprovide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "MEIcoder\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac01 \uc790\uadf9\uc744 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ub4dc\ubb3c\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc601\uc7a5\ub958\ub098 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub192\uc740 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9 \uae30\ub85d \uae30\uc220 \uc801\uc6a9\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc, \uc2dc\uac01 \uc790\uadf9 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MEIcoder\ub294 \ub274\ub7f0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uac00\uc7a5 \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc785\ub825(MEIs), \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc9c0\uc218 \uce21\uc815 \uc190\uc2e4, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MEIcoder\ub294 \ucd08\ub4f1 \uc2dc\uac01 \ud53c\uc9c8(V1)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc138\ud3ec \ud65c\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc790\uadf9\uc744 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MEIcoder\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc758 \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \uc2e0\uacbd \uacfc\ud559 \ubc0f \uc2e0\uacbd \uacf5\ud559 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uacbd \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac01 \uc790\uadf9\uc744 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub1cc\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ub1cc-\uae30\uacc4 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc601\uc7a5\ub958\ub098 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9 \uae30\ub85d \uae30\uc220\uc778 2\uad11\uc790 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub274\ub7f0 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc785\ub825(MEI), \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc9c0\uc218 \uc190\uc2e4 \ubc0f \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 MEIcoder\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
