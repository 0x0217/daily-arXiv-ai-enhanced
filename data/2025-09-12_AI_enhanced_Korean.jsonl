A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph\nis linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are\nencountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there\nare thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking\nmentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental\ntask in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,\nsuch as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an\nessential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm.

We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning\nRepresentation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that\nincorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and\nclinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During\npretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that\nshare similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are\ndissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological\nsimilarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically\nmeaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific\naugmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a\nhybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.\nResults: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,\nfor multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for\nbinary classification.

Kobayashi", "Weinan Zhang"], "title": "EnvX: Agentize Everything with Agentic AI", "comment": null, "summary": "The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast\ncollection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains\nmanual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,\nunderstand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to\nefficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that\nleverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into\nintelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and\ninter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories\nas static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a\nthree-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up\nthe necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned\nagentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform\nreal-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple\nagents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with\nstructured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the\nentire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository\nfunctionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18\nrepositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,\ndocument analysis, and video manipulation.

Over time, various\nenhancements have been introduced to strengthen the integrity of DNS. Among\nthese, DNSSEC stands out as a leading cryptographic solution. It protects\nagainst attacks (such as DNS spoofing) by establishing a chain of trust\nthroughout the DNS nameserver hierarchy. However, DNSSEC's effectiveness is\ncompromised when there is a break in this chain, resulting in \"Islands of\nSecurity\", where domains can authenticate locally but not across hierarchical\nlevels, leading to a loss of trust and validation between them. Leading\napproaches to addressing these issues were centralized, with a single authority\nmaintaining some kind of bulletin board. This approach requires significantly\nmore infrastructure and places excessive trust in the entity responsible for\nmanaging it properly. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach to\naddressing gaps in DNSSEC's chain of trust, commonly referred to as \"Islands of\nSecurity\". We leverage TLS and IP-based certificates to enable end-to-end\nauthentication between hierarchical levels, eliminating the need for uniform\nDNSSEC deployment across every level of the DNS hierarchy. This approach\nenhances the overall integrity of DNSSEC, while reducing dependence on\nregistrars for maintaining signature records to verify the child nameserver's\nauthenticity.

Critical to this\nsuccess are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens\nbased on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel\nframework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal\nstructures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of\ninduction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and\nlearn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal\nstructure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the\nrelationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our\nframework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with\ndifferent lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting\nunveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows\ntransformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure\nin-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism\nto predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the\ncorresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a\n3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a\ntheoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to\nthe maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how\ntransformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their\nfunctioning and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs\nrequires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces\nnon-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)\nalongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy\nOptimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training\nalgorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute\nnodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while \"sharing\" rollouts\nwith others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model\nhomogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.\nAs a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL\npost-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By\nsampling rollouts \"shared\" across the network, it enables \"Aha moments\" to\npropagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show\nSAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.\nWe also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes\ncontributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse\nhardware and models during an open-source demo.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 Swarm sAmpling Policy Optimization(SAPO)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c RL\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uae30\uc220\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub3d9\ubc18\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SAPO\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud2b8 \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 RL \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c, \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \uc11c\ub85c '\uacf5\uc720'\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SAPO\ub294 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 94%\uc758 \ub204\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc218\ucc9c \uac1c\uc758 \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacb0\uacfc \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SAPO\ub294 RL \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uacf5\ud1b5 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc8fc\uba70, \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ubd80\ud305\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub7a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LM)\uc740 DeepSeek-R1-Zero\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ub41c \ubc14\uc640 \uac19\uc774, \uac10\ub3c5 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c RL\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc740 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubcd1\ub82c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5f0, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ub298\uc5b4\ub098\ub294 \uc7ac\uc815\uc801 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Swarm sAmpling Policy Optimization(SAPO)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, when each task owner\nindependently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data\nexchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in\nsignificant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)\nmodel based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent\narchitecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful\ncomputational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to\nmultidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics\nextraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving\ntask-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent\ntransfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,\nenabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation\ntime, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of\ncollaborator selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud611\ub825 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c 2TSD \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825\uc790\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud611\ub825 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\ud615 AI \ubaa8\ub378(LAM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad50\uc0ac-\ud559\uc0dd \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc99d\ub958(2TSD) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c 2TSD \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc790 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub2e8\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba70 \ud611\ub825\uc790 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud611\ub825 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc790 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad00\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc18c\uc720\uc790\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud611\ub825\uc790\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ub54c, \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad50\ud658, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud669 \ubcc0\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc800\ud558\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 AI \ubaa8\ub378(LAM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad50\uc0ac-\ud559\uc0dd \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc99d\ub958(2TSD) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad50\uc0ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uba70, \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad00\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1, \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc758\ubbf8 \ucd94\ucd9c \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5-\ud611\ub825\uc790 \ub9e4\uce6d \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc99d\uac15 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc804\ub2f4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc7a5\uce58 \uce21 \ud559\uc0dd \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ubc1b\uc73c\uba74, \uad50\uc0ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud611\ub825\uc790\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud559\uc0dd \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud611\ub825\uc790 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c 2TSD \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc790 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba70 \ud611\ub825\uc790 \uc120\ud0dd \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

This paper provides a\ncomprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic\ndesign that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore\nthe foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the\nPlanner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability,\ncost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct\n(Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this\ndesign, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection\nattacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E\nprovides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we\ndetail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least\nPrivilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these\nprinciples actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints\nand working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain\n(via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing\nthe P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's\nstateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for\nsecurity, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss\nadvanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with\nDirected Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop\n(HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects,\ndevelopers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient,\nand trustworthy LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uba70 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, '\uacc4\ud68d-\uc2e4\ud589' \ud328\ud134\uc758 \uc124\uacc4 \uc6d0\uce59\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548 \uc758\uc758\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub418\uba74\uc11c, \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uba70 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc804\uc220\uc801 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc778 '\uacc4\ud68d-\uc2e4\ud589' (P-t-E) \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.

NeurIPS 2024", "summary": "This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)\nframework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied\nagents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large\nLanguage Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently\nexploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context\nmemory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying\nenvironment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following\ntasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context\nmemory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently\nhandle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,\nwe implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating\nthe {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.\nCombined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not\nonly allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental\ncontext memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves\noverall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency\nrefinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of\nknowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and\nCARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied\ninstruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and\ntypes, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal\nsuccess rate and execution efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "ExRAP \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc218\ud589 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud658\uacbd \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc218\ud589 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ud658\uacbd \ub9e5\ub77d \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac\uc640 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc73c\ub85c \uac01 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc2e0 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ExRAP \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc218\ud589 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uacc4\ud68d(ExRAP) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ud658\uacbd \ub9e5\ub77d \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This dissertation explores\nstrategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,\nlocal training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for\nbiased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then\npropose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to\naccelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix\nbalances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance\nunder both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving\npruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,\nwith Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device\noverhead.

However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where\nByzantine clients compromise the integrity of the global model by submitting\nmalicious updates. Robust aggregation methods have been widely adopted to\nmitigate such threats, relying on the core assumption that malicious updates\nare inherently out-of-distribution and can therefore be identified and excluded\nbefore aggregating client updates. In this paper, we challenge this underlying\nassumption by showing that a model can be poisoned while keeping malicious\nupdates within the main distribution. We propose Chameleon Poisoning (CHAMP),\nan adaptive and evasive poisoning strategy that exploits side-channel feedback\nfrom the aggregation process to guide the attack. Specifically, the adversary\ncontinuously infers whether its malicious contribution has been incorporated\ninto the global model and adapts accordingly. This enables a dynamic adjustment\nof the local loss function, balancing a malicious component with a camouflaging\ncomponent, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the poisoning while evading\nrobust aggregation defenses. CHAMP enables more effective and evasive\npoisoning, highlighting a fundamental limitation of existing robust aggregation\ndefenses and underscoring the need for new strategies to secure federated\nlearning against sophisticated adversaries. Our approach is evaluated in two\ndatasets reaching an average increase of 47.07% in attack success rate against\nnine robust aggregation defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc8fc \ubd84\ud3ec \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc788\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc778 Chameleon Poisoning (CHAMP)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud3ec\uc774\uc988\ub2dd \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Chameleon Poisoning (CHAMP)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud3ec\uc774\uc988\ub2dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc9d1\uacc4 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc0ac\uc774\ub4dc\ucc44\ub110 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CHAMP\ub294 \uc544\ud649 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\uc5b4\uccb4\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0 47.07% \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\uc5b4\uccb4\uacc4\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ubd80\uac01\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 FL\uc740 \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ud6fc\uc190\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3ec\uc774\uc988\ub2dd \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc73c\uba70, \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678\uc5d0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\uc678\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc8fc \ubd84\ud3ec \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud3ec\uc774\uc988\ub2dd\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \uae30\ubcf8 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Chameleon Poisoning (CHAMP)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615\uc774\uba70 \ud68c\ud53c\uc801\uc778 \ud3ec\uc774\uc988\ub2dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc9d1\uacc4 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc774\ub4dc\ucc44\ub110 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc801\ub300\uc790\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc5ec\uac00 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uc5c8\ub294\uc9c0 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ub85c\uceec \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc758\uc801 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \uc704\uc7a5 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \ud3ec\uc774\uc988\ub2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud68c\ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.

With this system, we compute similarity scores based\non multiple musical features that can be evaluated through comprehensive\nmusical analysis. Our approach demonstrated promising results in music\nplagiarism detection experiments, and the proposed method can be applied to\nreal-world music scenarios. We also collected a Similar Music Pair (SMP)\ndataset for musical similarity research using real-world cases. The dataset are\npublicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc74c\uc545 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc74c\uc545 \ud45c\uc808\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc74c\uc545 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc74c\uc545 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ubc30\ud3ec\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc811\uadfc \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc84c\uc73c\uba70, \uc74c\uc545 \uc800\uc791\uad8c \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc74c\uc545 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc804\uc0ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ub179\uc74c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc74c\uc545\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc74c\uc545 \ud615\uc2dd \uac04\uc758 \ud45c\uc808\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc74c\uc545\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc74c\uc545 \ud45c\uc808 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc74c\uc545 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc74c\uc545 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc0ac \uc74c\uc545 \uc30d(SMP) \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \uacf5\uac1c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc74c\uc545 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9(MIR) \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc74c\uc545 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ubc30\ud3ec \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc74c\uc545 \uc800\uc791\uad8c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc74c\uc545 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc7ac\uc0b0\uad8c \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c MIR \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc74c\uc545 \ud45c\uc808\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc74c\uc131 \ub179\uc74c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc74c\uc545\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc74c\uc545 \ud615\uc2dd \uac04\uc758 \ud45c\uc808\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc74c\uc545 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc804\uc0ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc74c\uc545 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc74c\uc545\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc74c\uc545 \ud45c\uc808 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc74c\uc545 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc74c\uc545 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc0ac \uc74c\uc545 \uc30d(SMP) \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \uacf5\uac1c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based\nsequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through\nestimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,\nproving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of\nthe input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid\nconvergence in just a few iterations.

Training a benign model from a dataset\npoisoned by backdoor attacks is challenging. Existing works rely on various\nassumptions and can only defend against backdoor attacks with specific trigger\nsignals, high poisoning ratios, or when the defender possesses a large,\nuntainted, validation dataset. In this paper, we propose a defense called\nPrototype-Guided Robust Learning (PGRL), which overcomes all the aforementioned\nlimitations, being robust against diverse backdoor attacks. Leveraging a tiny\nset of benign samples, PGRL generates prototype vectors to guide the training\nprocess. We compare our PGRL with 8 existing defenses, showing that it achieves\nsuperior robustness. We also demonstrate that PGRL generalizes well across\nvarious architectures, datasets, and advanced attacks. Finally, to evaluate our\nPGRL in the worst-case scenario, we perform an adaptive attack, where the\nattackers fully know the details of the defense.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 Prototype-Guided Robust Learning(PGRL)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc624\uc5fc\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4\ub97c \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc120 \uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud2b9\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba74 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac74\uc804\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PGRL\uc740 \uc18c\ub7c9\uc758 \uac74\uc804\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "PGRL\uc740 8\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b, \uace0\uae09 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub428\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PGRL\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc758 \uc138\ubd80\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc54c\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc624\uc5fc\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4\ub97c \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc815\ub2f9\ud55c \uc785\ub825\uc5d0\ub294 \uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud2b9\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba74 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uac74\uc804\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70 \uc2e0\ud638, \ub192\uc740 \uc624\uc5fc \ube44\uc728, \ub610\ub294 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\uac00 \ud070 \ubb34\uc624\uc5fc \uac80\uc99d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ubcf4\uc720\ud560 \ub54c\ub9cc \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubc29\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Prototype-Guided Robust Learning(PGRL)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacac\uace0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc18c\ub7c9\uc758 \uac74\uc804\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec PGRL\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 PGRL\uc744 \uae30\uc874 8\uac1c\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c PGRL\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b, \uace0\uae09 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub428\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c PGRL\uc744 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc758 \uc138\ubd80\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc544\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal\nAdaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves\nrobustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web\nsearch trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive\nspectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into\nseasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid\nfeature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba\nstate-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal\nconvolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention\nmechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.\nFinally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,\nwith an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty.

Drawing inspiration from recent\nadvances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our\napproach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,\nexternal intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features\ndynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data\nhandling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge\nparadigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators\nremain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a\ncollaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise.

Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align\nwith the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and\nhallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating\nfurther alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning\nand chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and\naction-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,\nand model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes\nThought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied\ndecision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based\noptimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step\nsample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning\nprocess, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by\nincorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes\nconsistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld\nenvironment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%\nimprovement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in\nmitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the\npotential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT\nprocesses to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models\nin embodied agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5f4\ud654\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "VLM\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9e5\ub77d-specific \ub3d9\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uc744 \ub530\ub77c\uac00\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TCPO\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ub354 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc30d\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ALFWorld \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\uacf5\ub960 26.67%\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec RL4VLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 6% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd94\ucc9c \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc95\uacfc CoT \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \ud2b9\uc815 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac10\ub3c5 \ud558\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub354 \uc798 \ub9de\ucd9c \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub290\ub9b0 \ubc18\uc751\uacfc \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec \ub354\uc6b1 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 SFT \ud6c4 \ub300\ucc98 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc5f0\uc1c4(CoT) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \ub098\uc05c \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5f4\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \uc911\uc2ec \uc120\ud638 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(TCPO)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

ChemBOMAS's optimization\nprocess is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:\nknowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained\noptimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,\nLLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing\nchemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in\nthe data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process\nwithin these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby\nimproving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark\nevaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances\noptimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.\nImportantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab\nexperiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting\nconditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical\nreaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value\nof 96%.

Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,\nare fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\\&When,\nstate-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\\% accuracy in locating the\nroot-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the\nfirst failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity\ncausal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a\nperformance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance\ndependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with\nShapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal\ndiscovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps\nby tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's\nattribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating\ntargeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual\nsimulations. Evaluations on the Who\\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a\nsignificant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\\% step-level\naccuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success\nrates by an average of 22.4\\%.

Project:\n  https://AgentGym-RL.github.io/. Framework and Code:\n  https://github.com/woooodyy/AgentGym, https://github.com/woooodyy/AgentGym-RL", "summary": "Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent\ndecisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like\nhuman cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and\nskills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite\nadvances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --\nwithout relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic\nenvironments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The\nframework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high\nflexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world\nscenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose\nScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation\nbalance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation\nby restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards\nexploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving\nstrategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on\n27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will\nopen-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets\n-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of\nintelligent agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c

Correspondence: alijanpour@ucf.edu", "summary": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in\nchildren that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and\ncareer life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients\nand the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This\npaper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and\ntimeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram\n(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive\ntemporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability\ntechniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction\nand refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and\nvalidated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),\nemploying nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed\ntwo-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.\nInitially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner\n2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various\nstandard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.\nADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC\nsubjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and\nfrequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and\nactivation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed\nStochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding\nin interpreting the model's decisions.
