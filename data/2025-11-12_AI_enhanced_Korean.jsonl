Reproducibility package with MLflow artifacts and Google Colab notebooks available upon publication", "summary": "LLM-based autonomous research agents report false claims: tasks marked \"complete\" despite missing artifacts, contradictory metrics, or failed executions. EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.\n  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.\n  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.\n  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol. Research integrity is an architectural property, achieved through governance gates rather than emergent from model scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "EviBound\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud655\uc778 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uad00\ub9ac \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac70\uc9d3 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, 8\uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uace0, 0% \ud658\uac01\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\uc728 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub204\ub77d\ub41c \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8, \uc0c1\ubc18\ub41c \uce21\uc815\uac12, \ub610\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 '\uc644\ub8cc'\ub85c \ud45c\uc2dc\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0\ud568.", "method": "\uc0ac\uc804 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2b9\uc778 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac80\uc99d \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc99d\uac70 \uc694\uac74\uc744 \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\uba70, MLflow API \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \ud544\uc694\uc2dc \uc218\uc6a9 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc744 \uac80\uc99d.", "result": "EviBound\ub294 8\uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc911 7\uac1c\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 1\uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2b9\uc778 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc62c\ubc14\ub974\uac8c \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\uc5ec 0% \ud658\uac01\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc57d 8.3%\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub9cc \ubc1c\uc0dd.", "conclusion": "\uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc740 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc774\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uad00\ub9ac \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2ec\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\uc728 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub204\ub77d\ub41c \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8, \ubaa8\uc21c\ub41c \uc9c0\ud45c \ub610\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 '\uc644\ub8cc'\ub85c \ud45c\uc2dc\ub41c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce SMAGDi, a distillation framework that transfers the debate dynamics of a five-agent Llama-based MAS into a compact Socratic decomposer-solver student. SMAGDi represents debate traces as directed interaction graphs, where nodes encode intermediate reasoning steps with correctness labels and edges capture continuity and cross-agent influence. The student is trained with a composite objective combining language modeling, graph-based supervision, contrastive reasoning, and embedding alignment to preserve both fluency and structured reasoning. On StrategyQA and MMLU, SMAGDi compresses a 40B multi-agent system into a 6B student while retaining 88% of its accuracy, substantially outperforming prior distillation methods such as MAGDi, standard KD, and fine-tuned baselines. These results highlight that explicitly modeling interaction graphs and Socratic decomposition enable small models to inherit the accuracy benefits of multi-agent debate while remaining efficient enough for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SMAGDi\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud1a0\ub860 \ub3d9\ub825\uc744 \uc18c\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uc99d\ub958 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud1a0\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SMAGDi\ub294 \ud1a0\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uba70, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SMAGDi\ub294 40B \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 6B \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 88%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc18c\ud06c\ub77c\ud2f1 \ubd84\ud574\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc18c\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc804\uc774\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud1a0\ub860\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SMAGDi\ub77c\ub294 \uc99d\ub958 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uace0\uc815\ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uace0\uc815\uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc8fc\uccb4\uc774\uc790 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc870\uc0ac\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \ud45c\uba74\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ubc29\uc778\uc9c0 \ub610\ub294 \ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \ud655\ub960 \ubcc0\ud654\uc778\uc9c0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774\ubc88 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 (1) \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \ud1b5\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc815\uc7a5\uce58\uac00 \uc804\uccb4 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ub85c\uadf8 \ud655\ub960 \uae30\ubc18 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d, (2) \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud544\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc0e4\ud50c\ub9ac \uac12 \uadc0\uc18d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\uc815\uc7a5\uce58\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub85c\uadf8 \ud655\ub960\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654, (3) \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc99d\uac70\uc640 \uadc0\uc18d \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uace0\uc815\ud3b8\ud5a5 \uac10\ub3c4 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 Gemma-2B, Phi-2, Llama-2-7B\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uace0\uc815 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uadc0\uc18d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uace0\uc815\uc7a5\uce58\uac00 \uc7ac\uac00\uc911\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, GPT-Neo-125M\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uaddc\ubaa8\uac00 \uac10\uc218\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uace0\uc815\ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc801\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c\ub294 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacfc\ud559, LLM \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubc0f \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub978 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc8fc\uccb4\uc774\uc790 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc870\uc0ac\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \ud45c\uba74 \ubaa8\ubc29\uc778\uc9c0 \uae4a\uc740 \ud655\ub960 \ubcc0\ud654\uc778\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\uc815\ud3b8\ud5a5\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \ud310\ub2e8 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac80\uc0ac \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc774 \uace0\uc815\ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc99d\uac70\ub294 \ud45c\uba74 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ubd80 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub294 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uace0\uc815\ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \ud1b5\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc815\uc7a5\uce58\uac00 \uc804\uccb4 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub85c\uadf8 \ud655\ub960 \uae30\ubc18 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d;

This is mainly due to their high degree of flexibility with respect to their area of application. GEPOC ABM is one of these models. Developed in 2015, it is now a well-established decision support tool and has been successfully applied for a wide range of population-level research questions ranging from health-care to logistics. At least in part, this success is attributable to continuous improvement and development of new methods. While some of these are very application- or implementation-specific, others can be well transferred to other population models. The focus of the present work lies on the presentation of three selected transferable innovations. We illustrate an innovative time-update concept for the individual agents, a co-simulation-inspired simulation strategy, and a strategy for accurate model parametrisation. We describe these methods in a reproducible manner, explain their advantages and provide ideas on how they can be transferred to other population models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3d9\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uad6c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc778\uae30\ub97c \ub04c\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0, \uc989 \uac1c\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uac1c\ub150, \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc804\ub7b5, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uc7a5\uc810, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc778\uad6c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GEPOC ABM\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548, \uad6d\uac00\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc8fc\ubbfc\uc744 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uad6c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc778\uae30\ub97c \ub04c\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate through experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4

We study autonomous pickup-and-delivery routing problems in which adversarial agents launch coordinated denial-of-service attacks by spoofing their locations. This deception causes the central scheduler to assign pickup requests to adversarial agents instead of cooperative agents. Adversarial agents then choose not to service the requests with the goal of disrupting the operation of the system, leading to delays, cancellations, and potential instability in the routing policy. Policy stability in routing problems is typically defined as the cost of the policy being uniformly bounded over time, and it has been studied through two different lenses: queuing theory and reinforcement learning (RL), which are not well suited for routing with adversaries. In this paper, we propose a new stability criterion, STAIR, which is easier to analyze than queuing-theory-based stability in adversarial settings. Furthermore, STAIR does not depend on a chosen discount factor as is the case in discounted RL stability. STAIR directly links stability to desired operational metrics, like a finite number of rejected requests. This characterization is particularly useful in adversarial settings as it provides a metric for monitoring the effect of adversaries in the operation of the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate STAIR's practical relevance through simulations on real-world San Francisco mobility-on-demand data. We also identify a phenomenon of degenerate stability that arises in the adversarial routing problem, and we introduce time-window constraints in the decision-making algorithm to mitigate it.", "AI":

However, many approaches miss post-fix latent vulnerabilities that remain even after patches typically due to incomplete fixes or overlooked issues may later lead to zero-day exploits. In this paper, we propose $HYDRA$, a $Hy$brid heuristic-guided $D$eep $R$epresentation $A$rchitecture for predicting latent zero-day vulnerabilities in patched functions that combines rule-based heuristics with deep representation learning to detect latent risky code patterns that may persist after patches. It integrates static vulnerability rules, GraphCodeBERT embeddings, and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to uncover anomalies often missed by symbolic or neural models alone. We evaluate HYDRA in an unsupervised setting on patched functions from three diverse real-world software projects: Chrome, Android, and ImageMagick. Our results show HYDRA predicts 13.7%, 20.6%, and 24% of functions from Chrome, Android, and ImageMagick respectively as containing latent risks, including both heuristic matches and cases without heuristic matches ($None$) that may lead to zero-day vulnerabilities. It outperforms baseline models that rely solely on regex-derived features or their combination with embeddings, uncovering truly risky code variants that largely align with known heuristic patterns. These results demonstrate HYDRA's capability to surface hidden, previously undetected risks, advancing software security validation and supporting proactive zero-day vulnerabilities discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "HYDRA\ub294 \ud328\uce58\ub41c \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\ub85c\ub370\uc774 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc2ec\uce35 \ud45c\ud604 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud328\uce58 \ud6c4\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub193\uce58\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "HYDRA\ub294 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uacfc \uc2ec\uce35 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud328\uce58 \ud6c4\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8 \ucf54\ub4dc \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "HYDRA\ub294 Chrome, Android, ImageMagick\uc758 \ud328\uce58\ub41c \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 13.7%, 20.6%, 24%\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 HYDRA\uac00 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc81c\ub85c\ub370\uc774 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uac15\ud654\ub420 \ub54c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud328\uce58 \ud6c4\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub193\uce58\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc218\uc815\uc774\ub098 \uac04\uacfc\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc81c\ub85c\ub370\uc774 \uc545\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud328\uce58\ub41c \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\ub85c\ub370\uc774 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud63c\ud569 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud45c\ud604 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 $HYDRA$\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. $HYDRA$\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \uaddc\uce59, GraphCodeBERT \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubc0f \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(VAE)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub098 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub193\uce58\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8(Chrome, Android \ubc0f ImageMagick)\uc758 \ud328\uce58\ub41c \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c HYDRA\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, HYDRA\ub294 \uac01\uac01 Chrome, Android \ubc0f ImageMagick\uc758 \ud568\uc218 \uc911 13.7%, 20.6%, 24%\uac00 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc77c\uce58 \ubc0f \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc77c\uce58\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0($None$)\uc758 \ud3ec\ud568\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ub85c\ub370\uc774 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing methods, predominantly graph-based or attention-driven, rely on similarity-driven connectivity assumptions, neglecting asymmetric flow exchanges that govern system evolution. We propose Spatio-Temporal Flow, a physics-inspired paradigm that explicitly models dynamic node couplings through quantifiable flow transfers governed by conservation principles. Building on this, we design FlowNet, a novel architecture leveraging flow tokens as information carriers to simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution aligns with conservation laws. FlowNet dynamically adjusts the interaction radius through an Adaptive Spatial Masking module, suppressing irrelevant noise while enabling context-aware propagation. A cascaded architecture enhances scalability and nonlinear representation capacity. Experiments demonstrate that FlowNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on seven metrics in the modeling of three real-world systems, validating its efficiency and physical interpretability.

However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone.

Each agent has a limited view of their environment where buildings can occlude their field-of-view. Additionally, the pursuer team is agnostic about the evader in terms of its initial and final location, and the behavior of the evader. Consequently, the team needs to gather information by searching the environment and then track it to eventually intercept. To solve this multi-player, partially-observable, pursuit-evasion game, we develop a two-phase neuro-symbolic algorithm centered around the principle of bounded rationality. First, we devise an offline approach using deep reinforcement learning to progressively train adversarial policies for the pursuer team against fictitious evaders. This creates $k$-levels of rationality for each agent in preparation for the online phase. Then, we employ an online classification algorithm to determine a \"best guess\" of our current opponent from the set of iteratively-trained strategic agents and apply the best player response. Using this schema, we improved average performance when facing a random evader in our environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \ub450 \ub300\uac00 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\ud53c UAV\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud300\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\uc57c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ucd94\uaca9-\ud68c\ud53c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\uc57c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 UAV \ud300\uc774 \ud68c\ud53c UAV\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uace0 \ud3ec\ud68d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "\uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud569\ub9ac\uc131 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd-\uae30\ud638 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\ub958 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9.", "result": "\ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ud68c\ud53c UAV\uc640\uc758 \ub300\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uc131\uacf5\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc774 UAV \ud300\uc758 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\ud53c UAV\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud658\uacbd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\ud53c UAV\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ub300\uc758 \ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV) \ud300\uc758 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\uc57c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uba70 \uac74\ubb3c\ub4e4\uc774 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2dc\uc57c\ub97c \uac00\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ucd94\uc801 \ud300\uc740 \ud68c\ud53c\uc790\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc885 \uc704\uce58\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubb34\uad00\uc2ec\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ud300\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uad6d \uac00\ub85c\ucc44\uae30\uc5d0 \ub098\uc544\uac00\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4, \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5, \ucd94\uaca9-\ud68c\ud53c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud569\ub9ac\uc131 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd-\uae30\ud638 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uace0\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud5c8\uad6c\uc758 \ud68c\ud53c\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uc801 \ud300\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ube44\ud574 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 $k$-\ub808\ubca8\uc758 \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubd84\ub958 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ub300\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c '\ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \ucd94\uce21'\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc88b\uc740 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ud68c\ud53c\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Leveraging a recently leaked MySQL dump of the gang's management panel, this study offers an end-to-end reconstruction of LockBit's technical, behavioral, and financial apparatus. We recall the family's version timeline and map its tactics, techniques, and procedures to MITRE ATT&CK, highlighting the incremental hardening that distinguishes LockBit 3.0 from its predecessors. We then analyze 51 negotiation chat logs using natural-language embeddings and clustering to infer a canonical interaction playbook, revealing recurrent rhetorical stages that underpin the double-extortion strategy. Finally, we trace 19 Bitcoin addresses related to ransom payment chains, revealing two distinct patterns based on different laundering phases. In both cases, a small portion of the ransom is immediately split into long-lived addresses (presumably retained by the group as profit and to finance further operations) while the remainder is ultimately aggregated into two high-volume addresses before likely being sent to the affiliate. These two collector addresses appear to belong to distinct exchanges, each processing over 200k BTC.

When $\u03c4$ is unknown, a fundamental scale ambiguity emerges that couples $\u03c4$ with the reward parameters ($\u03b8$), making them statistically unidentifiable. We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $\u03b8$ and $\u03c4$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity. We propose an efficient Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator and prove it achieves the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for joint parameter recovery. When strong identifiability conditions fail, we provide partial identification guarantees through confidence set construction. We extend our framework to Markov games and demonstrate optimal convergence rates with strong empirical performance even when transition dynamics are unknown.", "AI": {"tldr": "Blind-IGT\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc640 \ube44\uc728 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uace0\uc720 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc815\ub9bd\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "IQT \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\ub098 \uc628\ub3c4 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 $\u03c4$\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Blind-IGT \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 $\u03b8$\uc640 \uc628\ub3c4 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 $\u03c4$\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubcf5\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uace0\uc720 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc815\ub9bd\ud558\uace0, Normalized Least Squares(NLS) \ucd94\uc815\ub7c9\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\uc774 \uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 Markov \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc5ed \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860(IGT) \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ube44\ud310\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud569\ub9ac\uc131 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130(\uc628\ub3c4 $\u03c4$)\uac00 \uc0ac\uc804\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. $\u03c4$\uac00 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0, $\u03c4$\uc640 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218($\u03b8$)\uac00 \uacb0\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c $\u03b8$\uc640 $\u03c4$\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Blind-IGT\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc774\uc911 \uc120\ud615 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc720 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucda9\ubd84\uc870\uac74\uacfc \ud544\uc694\uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc815\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc81c\uacf1(NLS) \ucd94\uc815\ub7c9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uac83\uc774 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 $\text{O}(N^{-1/2})$ \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac15\ud55c \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc870\uac74\uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc9d1\ud569 \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Markov \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \uc804\uc774 \uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

In this study, we present a comprehensive and fully open-source pipeline for training a high-performance agentic model for interacting with external tools and environments, named Klear-Qwen3-AgentForge, starting from the Qwen3-8B base model.

The paper considers two types of laws: useful laws that, if followed, completely eliminate the undesirable outcomes and gap-free laws that guarantee that at least one agent can be held responsible each time an undesirable outcome occurs. In both cases, we study the problem of finding a law that achieves the desired result by imposing the minimum restrictions.\n  We prove that, for both types of laws, the minimisation problem is NP-hard even in the simple case of one-shot concurrent interactions.

The balance between security and performance is increasingly fragile with the emergence of generative AI systems capable of autonomously generating and optimising sophisticated cryptanalysis and steganalysis algorithms, thereby accelerating the exposure of vulnerabilities in conventional data-hiding schemes.\n  This work introduces SteganoSNN, a neuromorphic steganographic framework that exploits spiking neural networks (SNNs) to achieve secure, low-power, and high-capacity multimedia data hiding. Digitised audio samples are converted into spike trains using leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, encrypted via a modulo-based mapping scheme, and embedded into the least significant bits of RGBA image channels using a dithering mechanism to minimise perceptual distortion. Implemented in Python using NEST and realised on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA, SteganoSNN attains real-time operation with an embedding capacity of 8 bits per pixel. Experimental evaluations on the DIV2K 2017 dataset demonstrate image fidelity between 40.4 dB and 41.35 dB in PSNR and SSIM values consistently above 0.97, surpassing SteganoGAN in computational efficiency and robustness.

Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRRL) addresses this by optimizing for worst-case performance within an uncertainty set defined by a robustness budget $\u03b5$. However, fixing $\u03b5$ results in a tradeoff between performance and robustness: small values yield high nominal performance but weak robustness, while large values can result in instability and overly conservative policies. We propose Distributionally Robust Self-Paced Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (DR-SPCRL), a method that overcomes this limitation by treating $\u03b5$ as a continuous curriculum. DR-SPCRL adaptively schedules the robustness budget according to the agent's progress, enabling a balance between nominal and robust performance. Empirical results across multiple environments demonstrate that DR-SPCRL not only stabilizes training but also achieves a superior robustness-performance trade-off, yielding an average 11.8\\% increase in episodic return under varying perturbations compared to fixed or heuristic scheduling strategies, and achieving approximately 1.9$\\times$ the performance of the corresponding nominal RL algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "DR-SPCRL\uc740 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801 \uac15\uc778\uc131 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac15\uc778\uc131 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uac15\uc778\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd \ubc30\ud3ec \uc2dc \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc885\uc885 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DR-SPCRL\uc740 \uac15\uc778\uc131 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uc5f0\uc18d \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c4\ud589\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uc815 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, DR-SPCRL\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud558\uba70 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uade0 11.8\\% \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf1c \uac15\uc778\uc131-\uc131\ub2a5 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DR-SPCRL\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc57d 1.9\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub420 \ub54c \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc885\uc885 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRRL)\uc740 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uc608\uc0b0 $\u03b5$\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 $\u03b5$\ub97c \uace0\uc815\ud558\uba74 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc791\uc740 \uac12\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uba85\ubaa9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc740 \uc57d\ud574\uc9c0\uace0, \ud070 \uac12\uc740 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\uac74 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uc5f0\uc18d \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DR-SPCRL)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We investigate whether agents can collaborate in fraudulent behaviors, how such collaboration amplifies risks, and what factors influence fraud success. To support this research, we present MultiAgentFraudBench, a large-scale benchmark for simulating financial fraud scenarios based on realistic online interactions. The benchmark covers 28 typical online fraud scenarios, spanning the full fraud lifecycle across both public and private domains. We further analyze key factors affecting fraud success, including interaction depth, activity level, and fine-grained collaboration failure modes. Finally, we propose a series of mitigation strategies, including adding content-level warnings to fraudulent posts and dialogues, using LLMs as monitors to block potentially malicious agents, and fostering group resilience through information sharing at the societal level. Notably, we observe that malicious agents can adapt to environmental interventions. Our findings highlight the real-world risks of multi-agent financial fraud and suggest practical measures for mitigating them.

Prior works have modeled this refusal mechanism as a single linear direction in the activation space. We posit that this is an oversimplification that conflates two functionally distinct neural processes: the detection of harm and the execution of a refusal. In this work, we deconstruct this single representation into a Harm Detection Direction and a Refusal Execution Direction. Leveraging this fine-grained model, we introduce Differentiated Bi-Directional Intervention (DBDI), a new white-box framework that precisely neutralizes the safety alignment at critical layer.

Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Trial-and-error learning stage: training the model with GRPO and collecting incorrect answers along with their corresponding questions in an error pool; (2) Self-correction learning stage: guiding the model to reflect on why its previous answers were wrong.

Their effectiveness highly depends on the specific nature of the task, especially the required domain knowledge. Existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts, typically operate at the task level; they are too coarse to effectively solve the heterogeneous problems involving multiple subjects. This work proposes a novel framework that performs fine-grained analysis at subject level equipped with a designated multi-agent collaboration strategy for addressing heterogeneous problem reasoning. Specifically, given an input query, we first employ a Graph Neural Network to identify the relevant subjects and infer their interdependencies to generate an \\textit{Subject-based Directed Acyclic Graph} (S-DAG), where nodes represent subjects and edges encode information flow. Then we profile the LLM models by assigning each model a subject-specific expertise score, and select the top-performing one for matching corresponding subject of the S-DAG. Such subject-model matching enables graph-structured multi-agent collaboration where information flows from the starting model to the ending model over S-DAG. We curate and release multi-subject subsets of standard benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, MedMCQA) to better reflect complex, real-world reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing task-level model selection and multi-agent collaboration baselines in accuracy and efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of subject-aware reasoning and structured collaboration in addressing complex and multi-subject problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

While recent studies have demonstrated jailbreak attacks on VLMs, existing approaches are limited: they require either white-box access, restricting practicality, or rely on manually crafted patterns, leading to poor sample diversity and scalability. To address these gaps, we propose JPRO, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework designed for automated VLM jailbreaking. It effectively overcomes the shortcomings of prior methods in attack diversity and scalability. Through the coordinated action of four specialized agents and its two core modules: Tactic-Driven Seed Generation and Adaptive Optimization Loop, JPRO generates effective and diverse attack samples. Experimental results show that JPRO achieves over a 60\\% attack success rate on multiple advanced VLMs, including GPT-4o, significantly outperforming existing methods.

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Maestro\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc131\uacf5\uc740 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\ub834\uc801 \ud569\uc131\uacfc\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc9c0 \uae34\uc7a5\uac10\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub2ec\ub824 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Maestro\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e4\ud589 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc218\ub834\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc559 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ud611\ub825 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

AMRs enhance operational flexibility but also increase the risk of deadlocks, which degrade system throughput and reliability. Existing approaches often neglect deadlock handling in the planning phase and rely on rigid control rules that cannot adapt to dynamic operational conditions.\n  To address these shortcomings, this work develops a structured methodology for integrating MARL into logistics planning and operational control. It introduces reference models that explicitly consider deadlock-capable multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems, enabling systematic evaluation of MARL strategies. Using grid-based environments and an external simulation software, the study compares traditional deadlock handling strategies with MARL-based solutions, focusing on PPO and IMPALA algorithms under different training and execution modes.\n  Findings reveal that MARL-based strategies, particularly when combined with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), outperform rule-based methods in complex, congested environments. In simpler environments or those with ample spatial freedom, rule-based methods remain competitive due to their lower computational demands. These results highlight that MARL provides a flexible and scalable solution for deadlock handling in dynamic intralogistics scenarios, but requires careful tailoring to the operational context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc774\ub3d9 \ub85c\ubd07(AMR)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubb3c\ub958 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad50\ucc29 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AMR\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc \uad50\ucc29 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uacc4\ud68d \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad50\ucc29 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc885\uc885 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 MARL\uc744 \ubb3c\ub958 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uad50\ucc29 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c \ucc3e\uae30(MAPF) \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc678\ubd80 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ucc29 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucc98\ub9ac \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc MARL \uae30\ubc18 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158(PPO \ubc0f IMPALA \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998)\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 MARL \uae30\ubc18 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589(CTDE)\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub420 \ub54c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ud63c\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc774\ub098 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc790\uc720\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc774\ub3d9 \ub85c\ubd07(AMR)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubb3c\ub958 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad50\ucc29 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.

We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.

However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from na\u00efvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings.

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $\u03bc$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training.

Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time. Experiments on three public datasets show that CSP4SDG (i) outperforms LLM-based baselines in every inference scenario, and (ii) boosts LLMs when supplied as an auxiliary \"reasoning tool.\" Our study validates that principled probabilistic reasoning with information theory is a scalable alternative-or complement-to heavy-weight neural models for SDGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "CSP4SDG\ub294

Raw data from diverse sources must be cleaned, normalized, and transformed to become AI-ready, while effective feature transformation and selection are essential for efficient training and inference. To address the challenges of scalability and expertise dependence, we present Data Agent, a fully autonomous system specialized for tabular data. Leveraging large language model (LLM) reasoning and grounded validation, Data Agent automatically performs data cleaning, hierarchical routing, and feature-level optimization through dual feedback loops. It embodies three core principles: automatic, safe, and non-expert friendly, which ensure end-to-end reliability without human supervision. This demo showcases the first practical realization of an autonomous Data Agent, illustrating how raw data can be transformed \"From Data to Better Data.\"", "AI": {"tldr": "Data Agent\ub294 \ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc644\uc804 \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc900\ube44 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uc5ec AI \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uc218\uc694 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc900\ube44\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Data Agent\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc815\ub9ac, \uacc4\uce35 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ubc0f \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc218\uc900 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Data Agent\ub294 AI \uc900\ube44\uac00 \uc644\ub8cc\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ub370\ubaa8\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c '\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c' \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7ac\ub8cc \ubc1c\uacac, \ubd84\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uae30\ud6c4 \uacfc\ud559\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc900\ube44\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd9c\ucc98\uc758 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 AI \uc900\ube44\uac00 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc815\ub9ac, \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubc0f \ubcc0\ud658\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubcc0\ud658 \ubc0f \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uc131 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 Data Agent\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Data Agent\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc815\ub9ac, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ubc0f \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc218\uc900 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654, \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubc0f \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uce5c\ud654\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uccb4\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub370\ubaa8\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c '\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c' \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Importantly, there is no centralized system coordinating their activities - agents are free to choose their own actions and develop their own narratives within the Station. Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing. A rich tapestry of narratives emerges as agents pursue independent research, interact with peers, and build upon a cumulative history. From these emergent narratives, novel methods arise organically, such as a new density-adaptive algorithm for scRNA-seq batch integration.

While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on eight public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets.

This challenges the prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800, VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its base model's 0.0.

Neglecting these trade-offs can lead to unintended consequences across sectors. However, existing assessments often evaluate emerging energy pathways and their impacts in silos, overlooking critical interactions such as regional resource competition and cumulative impacts. We present an integrated modeling framework that couples agent-based modeling and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to simulate how energy transition pathways interact with regional resource competition, ecological constraints, and community-level burdens.

While existing bendable RISC-V systems provide compact solutions, they lack the energy efficiency required. We present a mechanically flexible RISC-V that integrates a bespoke multiply-accumulate co-processor with fixed coefficients to maximize energy efficiency and minimize latency. Our approach formulates a constrained programming problem to jointly determine co-processor constants and optimally map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) inference operations, enabling compact, model-specific hardware by leveraging the low fabrication and non-recurring engineering costs of flexible technologies. Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables.

However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions. This work offers a promising solution for reliable and accurate accident anticipation in complex traffic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 ROAR\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc13c\uc11c \uc2e4\ud328\uc640 \ud658\uacbd \ubc29\ud574 \ub4f1 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ROAR\uc740 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc6e8\uc774\ube14\ub9bf \ubcc0\ud658(DWT), \uc790\uae30 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac1d\uccb4 \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub4c8, \ub3d9\uc801 \ucd08\uc810 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uace0 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DAD, CCD, A3D\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad50\ud1b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28(AV)\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc13c\uc11c \uc2e4\ud328, \ud658\uacbd \ubc29\ud574, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud558\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774\uc804 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc720\ud615 \uac04\uc758 \uc6b4\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc0ac\uace0\uc728\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uc801\uc808\ud788 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95 ROAR\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive workflows. The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions. The framework integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing and governing AI-enabled supply chain solutions.

A physics-informed design of partially input-convex neural networks (PICNN) plays a central role in constructing the flow field that emulates the displacement interpolation. During the training stage, we couple the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) residual in the OT formulation with the original flow matching loss function.

Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 B2B \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc704\uc784\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c governance-first \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GAIA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc870\uc9c1\ub4e4\uc740 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd \ubc0f \ud611\uc0c1 \uc5c5\ubb34\ub97c \uc704\uc784\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 B2B \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "GAIA\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud544\uc218 \uc5ed\ud560(\uc778\uac04, LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc0c1\ub300\ubc29)\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GAIA\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc704\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GAIA\ub294 \uc870\ub2ec, \ubd80\ub3d9\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uc778\ub825 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc870\uc9c1\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd \ubc0f \ud611\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc704\uc784\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 B2B \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc57d\uc18d \ubc29\uc9c0, \ud611\uc0c1 \uc804 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ud655\ubcf4, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubc0f \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc720\uc9c0. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc218\uc9d1, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc2b9\uc778 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubc0f \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ud1b5\ud569\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc0dd\ub7b5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 B2B \ud611\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GAIA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Nonetheless, the real effectiveness of moderation interventions remains unclear due to the high cost of data collection and limited experimental control. The latest developments in Natural Language Processing pave the way for a new evaluation approach. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability.

We introduce FastSVERL, a scalable method for explaining reinforcement learning by approximating Shapley values.

Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments.

The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples. The proposed attention transfer demonstrates an effective solution to learning relationships between data tables using an LLM in a low-resource learning environment.

However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies.

Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks,

This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 RL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc870\uac74\uacfc \ub2e4\ub978 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\uc704-\ud558\uc704 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uc815 \uc21c\uac04\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d \ud589\uc704\uac00 \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 '\uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654'\ub77c\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub354 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d Skipper \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Skipper\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d \uc911 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc640 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uacc4\ud68d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud658\uac01\ub41c \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac70\ubd80\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc870\uac74\uacfc \ub2e4\ub978 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ub7c9\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub3c4\uc640\uc8fc\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\uac04 \uacc4\ud68d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\uc704-\ud558\uc704 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 '\uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654'\ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc678\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4, \uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub354 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 Skipper \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubbf8\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uae30\uc6d0-\ubaa9\uc801\uc9c0 \ud589\ub82c \ucd94\uc815(DODE)\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "DODE \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uac1c\ubcc4 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc774\ub3d9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "DODE \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(MDP)\ub85c \ud615\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL)\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 30\ubd84 \ub3d9\uc548\uc758 5\ubd84 \uac04\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub9c1\ud06c \ud750\ub984\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28(MSE)\ub97c 43.2% \uc904\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DODE\ub97c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ubbf8\uc2dc\uc801 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubbf8\uc2dc\uc801 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uae30\uc6d0-\ubaa9\uc801\uc9c0 \ud589\ub82c \ucd94\uc815(DODE)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcf4\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4. \ubbf8\uc2dc\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c DODE \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub86f\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\uacfc\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 \uae30\uc6d0-\ubaa9\uc801\uc9c0(OD) \ud589\ub82c\uacfc \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub9c1\ud06c \ud750\ub984 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ud575\uc2ec \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc778 \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DODE \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(MDP)\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL)\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 OD \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 SUMO\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Nguyen-Dupuis \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, 30\ubd84 \ub3d9\uc548 5\ubd84 \uac04\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \uc9d1\uacc4\ub41c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub9c1\ud06c \ud750\ub984\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28(MSE)\ub97c 43.2% \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.

Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218\ub85d \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ud574\ub97c \ub07c\uce60 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc778\uc815\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \ubcf4\uace0 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uae30\ubc95(SRFT)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ube44\uc815\ub82c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uace0\ubc31\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ud574\ub97c \ub07c\uce60 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\ub3c4 \ub192\uc544\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc790\uae30 \ubcf4\uace0 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815(SRFT) \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc2e4\uc218\ub97c \uc778\uc815\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SRFT\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uac10\uc2dc\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc678\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uc6b4\ub370, \ube44\ubc00 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc138\ubd80 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uace0\ubc31\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc84c\ub2e4.

We introduce Forward Learning with EXperience (FLEX), a gradient-free learning paradigm that enables LLM agents to continuously evolve through accumulated experience. Specifically, FLEX cultivates scalable and inheritable evolution by constructing a structured experience library through continual reflection on successes and failures during interaction with the environment. FLEX delivers substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction (up to 23% on AIME25, 10% on USPTO50k, and 14% on ProteinGym). We further identify a clear scaling law of experiential growth and the phenomenon of experience inheritance across agents, marking a step toward scalable and inheritable continuous agent evolution.

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait\", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 UrbanLN\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "UrbanLN\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae34 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc5b5\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc640 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c UrbanLN\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM-\uc0dd\uc131 \ucea1\uc158\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \ub808\ubca8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc5ed \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc2dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uc2dd\ub41c \uc5bc\uad74 \ub098\uc774\uac00 \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \uac74\uac15\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac8c, \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc758 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc678\uad00\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ubc0f \ud658\uacbd\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 '\ucd08\uc0c1\ud654' \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uae34 \ucea1\uc158 \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ub82c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uacfc LLM \uc0dd\uc131 \ucea1\uc158\uc758 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud1b5\ud569\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 UrbanLN\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uae34 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc5b5\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc7a5\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uae34 \ucea1\uc158\uc744 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uc815\ub82c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\uc874 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uce6d \ubcf4\uac04 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. To complement this, we have also developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline that includes standardized implementations of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms. Leveraging this platform, we have conducted large-scale experiments, successfully establishing new performance baselines across multiple tasks. This work provides the academic community with a crucial platform for rigorous and reproducible assessment of multimodal models, aiming to propel the field of multimodal artificial intelligence to new heights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc735\ud569\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574

Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model.

Extensive research has aimed to understand NAG from various perspectives, and a recent line of work approaches this from the viewpoint of online learning and online-to-batch conversion, emphasizing the role of optimistic online algorithms for acceleration. In this work, we contribute to this perspective by proposing novel optimistic online-to-batch conversions that incorporate optimism theoretically into the analysis, thereby significantly simplifying the online algorithm design while preserving the optimal convergence rates. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our conversions through the following results: (i) when combined with simple online gradient descent, our optimistic conversion achieves the optimal accelerated convergence; (ii) our conversion also applies to strongly convex objectives, and by leveraging both optimistic online-to-batch conversion and optimistic online algorithms, we achieve the optimal accelerated convergence rate for strongly convex and smooth objectives, for the first time through the lens of online-to-batch conversion; (iii) our optimistic conversion can achieve universality to smoothness -- applicable to both smooth and non-smooth objectives without requiring knowledge of the smoothness coefficient -- and remains efficient as non-universal methods by using only one gradient query in each iteration. Finally, we highlight the effectiveness of our optimistic online-to-batch conversions by a precise correspondence with NAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubcfc\ub85d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 Nesterov\uc758 \uac00\uc18d \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654(NAG) \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uac00\uc18d \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "NAG\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub099\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub099\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e8\uc21c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud558\uac15\ubc95\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud560 \ub54c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub099\uad00\uc801 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uac00\uc18d \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uac15\ud55c \ubcfc\ub85d \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "NAG\uc640\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ub300\uc751\uc73c\ub85c \ub099\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubcfc\ub85d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 Nesterov \uac00\uc18d \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654(NAG) \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uac00\uc18d \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an H\u00e1jek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space.

While cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted \"value of information\". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010). We also provide an example interpretability analysis showing how one may explain the triage decision. Our work presents an interpretable, data-driven framework that optimizes AD diagnostic pathways and balances accuracy with cost, representing a step towards making early, reliable AD prediction more accessible in real-world practice. Future work should consider multiple categories of advanced features and larger-scale validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacbd\ub3c4 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uc560(MCI)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38 \ubcd1(AD)\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc804\ud658 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uce58\ub8cc\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, PET \uc2a4\uce94\uacfc CSF \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ube44\uc2f8\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0.", "method": "\ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec, \uc608\uce21\ub41c '\uc815\ubcf4 \uac00\uce58'\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uae09 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc5bb\uc74c.", "result": "ADNI \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MCI \ud658\uc790\uc758 AD \uc9c4\ud589 \uc608\uce21 \uacb0\uacfc, \uace0\uae09 \uac80\uc0ac \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 20% \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c AUROC 0.929\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AD \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc784\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uae30 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AD \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ub354 \uc811\uadfc \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc218\uc758 \uace0\uae09 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ubc0f \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uacbd\ub3c4 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uc560(MCI)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38\ubcd1(AD)\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc778 \ub9de\ucda4 \uce58\ub8cc\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uc9c0 \uac80\uc0ac\uc640 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc815\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, PET \uc2a4\uce94\uacfc CSF \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0\ub294 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \ube44\uc309\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9-\uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc608\uce21\ub41c '\uc815\ubcf4 \uac00\uce58'\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uae09\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38\ubcd1 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc601\uc0c1 \uc774\ub2c8\uc154\ud2f0\ube0c(ADNI)\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MCI \ud658\uc790\uc758 AD \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubc0f \uace0\uae09 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378(AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010)\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 AUROC 0.929\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uace0\uae09 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 20% \uc904\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud55c\ud3b8\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc124\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d \uc608\ub3c4 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AD \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc784\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uae30 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AD \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ub354 \uc811\uadfc \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc218\uc758 \uace0\uae09 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ubc0f \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning.

The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.", "AI": {"tldr": "PADiff\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud300\uc6d0\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 AHT \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AHT\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \uc801 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud300\uc6d0\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "PADiff\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \ud300\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud0c8\uc7a1\uc74c \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 AHT \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud611\ub825 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, PADiff\uac00 \uae30\uc874 AHT \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PADiff\ub294 \ud300\uc6d0\uacfc\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud611\ub825 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec AHT \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Ad hoc \ud300\uc6cc\ud06c(AHT)\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ub9cc\ub098\ubcf8 \uc801 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud300\uc6d0\ub4e4\uacfc \ud611\ub825\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling. MASS is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, especially when the amount of data is very limited. This result highlights its potential for efficient and scalable deployment in real-world low-resource sleep monitoring environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc790\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc218\uba74 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud55c \uad00\ucc30 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218\uc900 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec MASS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc591\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc77c \ub54c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MASS\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \uc218\uba74 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc30\uce58 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\ub3d9 \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd84\ub958\ub294 \uc218\uba74 \uc9c8 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc218\uba74 \uc7a5\uc560 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 EEG \uae30\ub85d\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucc29\uc6a9\ud615 \ub610\ub294 \uac00\uc815 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc218\uba74 \uc8fc\uae30\ub2f9 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc591\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud55c \uad00\ucc30 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc218\uc900 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc815\ubcf4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc804\uc5ed \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub85c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \ud328\uce58 \uc218\uc900\uacfc \uc218\uba74 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc575\ucee4 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, the design of SciML architectures, loss formulations, and training strategies remains an expert-driven research process, requiring extensive experimentation and problem-specific insights. Here we introduce AgenticSciML, a collaborative multi-agent system in which over 10 specialized AI agents collaborate to propose, critique, and refine SciML solutions through structured reasoning and iterative evolution. The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base.

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations.

We present preliminary evidence that DD exists in model-free DRL, investigating it systematically across varying model capacity using the Actor-Critic framework. We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape. These findings establish DD as a factor in DRL and provide an information-based mechanism for designing agents that are more general, transferable, and robust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354\ube14 \ub514\uc13c\ud2b8 \ud328\ub7ec\ub3c5\uc2a4\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub354\ube14 \ub514\uc13c\ud2b8 \ud328\ub7ec\ub3c5\uc2a4\ub294 \uacfc\ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf4\uac04\uc810\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ub2ec\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \ubb34\ubaa8\ub378 DRL\uc5d0\uc11c DD\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc608\ube44 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc5d0\ud3ed\ubcc4 DD \uace1\uc120\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud558\uac15 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc9c4\uc785\uc774 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac10\uc18c\uc640 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 DD\uac00 DRL\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ub354 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub354\ube14 \ub514\uc13c\ud2b8(DD) \ud328\ub7ec\ub3c5\uc2a4\ub294 \uacfc\ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf4\uac04\uc810\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 generalization\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c, \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL)\uc758 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac DRL\uc5d0\uc11c DD\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uc815\ucc45 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ucd08\uae30 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc5d0\ud3ed\ubcc4 DD \uace1\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud558\uac15 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac10\uc18c\uac00 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uac10\uc18c\ub294 \uacfc\ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\uac00 \uc190\uc2e4 \uacbd\uad00\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\ud3c9\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc790\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 DD\ub97c DRL\uc758 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models.", "AI": {"tldr":

Oliehoek"], "title": "Learning to Focus: Prioritizing Informative Histories with Structured Attention Mechanisms in Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning", "comment": "Accepted to Embodied World Models for Decision Making (EWM) Workshop at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Transformers have shown strong ability to model long-term dependencies and are increasingly adopted as world models in model-based reinforcement learning (RL) under partial observability. However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Transformer\uc758 self-attention \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc720\ub3c4 \uc120\ud5d8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c Transformer\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\uc6a9 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "self-attention \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ubcc4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uae38\uc774 \uc120\ud5d8\uacfc \ubd84\ud3ec \uc120\ud5d8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uacfc\uac70 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5.", "result": "Atari 100k \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc120\ud5d8\uc774 \uc720\uc775\ud55c \uc804\ud658\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uac8c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uc5ec 77% \uc0c1\ub300 \uac1c\uc120 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131.", "conclusion": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc120\ud5d8\uc744 self-attention\uc5d0 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc5ed\uc0ac \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21\ud558\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac RL \uada4\uc801\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc774\uc5b4\uc11c, \ud45c\uc900 self-attention\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacfc\uac70 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \uace0\ub974\uac8c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ubd84\uc0b0\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc758 self-attention \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc720\ub3c4 \uc120\ud5d8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ubcc4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uae38\uc774 \uc120\ud5d8\uacfc (ii) \uacfc\uac70 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc120\ud5d8. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uae30\ubc18 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 UniZero\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.", "AI": {"tldr": "DEEPPERSONA\ub294 \uace0\uc720\ud55c

These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases. During training, the OSDT encoder (robust to noise and effective at modeling localized, high-frequency structure) guides the neural encoder toward representations more aligned with tabular data. At inference, only the neural encoder is used, preserving flexibility and SSL compatibility. Spectral analysis highlights the distinct inductive biases of each encoder. Our method achieves consistent gains in low-label classification and regression across diverse tabular datasets, outperforming deep and tree-based supervised baselines.", "AI": {"tldr":

To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI

Prior work often utilizes model ensembles or multi-agent systems to collaboratively generate responses, effectively operating in a server-to-server paradigm. However, such approaches do not align well with practical deployment settings, where a limited number of server-side models are shared by many clients under modern internet architectures. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{CoLM} (\\textbf{Co}llaboration in \\textbf{L}arge-\\textbf{M}odels), a novel framework for collaborative reasoning that redefines cooperation among large models from a client-server perspective. Unlike traditional ensemble methods that rely on simultaneous inference from multiple models to produce a single output, CoLM allows the outputs of multiple models to be aggregated or shared, enabling each client model to independently refine and update its own generation based on these high-quality outputs. This design enables collaborative benefits by fully leveraging both client-side and shared server-side models. We further extend CoLM to vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrating its applicability beyond language tasks. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that CoLM consistently improves model performance on previously failed queries, highlighting the effectiveness of collaborative guidance in enhancing single-model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoLM\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8-\uc11c\ubc84 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc815\uc758\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc774\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc778\ud130\ub137 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc11c\ubc84 \uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc798 \ub9de\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "CoLM\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, CoLM\uc740 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud611\uc5c5 \uc9c0\ub3c4\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294\ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc774\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc774\ub098 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc11c\ubc84 \uac04 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc778\ud130\ub137 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9ce\uc740 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc218\uc758 \uc11c\ubc84 \uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\ud3ec \uc124\uc815\uacfc \uc798 \ub9de\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8-\uc11c\ubc84 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CoLM(\ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud611\ub825)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While large datasets exist for web and mobile interactions, high-quality resources for desktop environments are limited. To address this gap, we introduce GroundCUA, a large-scale desktop grounding dataset built from expert human demonstrations. It covers 87 applications across 12 categories and includes 56K screenshots, with every on-screen element carefully annotated for a total of over 3.56M human-verified annotations. From these demonstrations, we generate diverse instructions that capture a wide range of real-world tasks, providing high-quality data for model training. Using GroundCUA, we develop the GroundNext family of models that map instructions to their target UI elements. At both 3B and 7B scales, GroundNext achieves state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks using supervised fine-tuning, while requiring less than one-tenth the training data of prior work. Reinforcement learning post-training further improves performance, and when evaluated in an agentic setting on the OSWorld benchmark using o3 as planner, GroundNext attains comparable or superior results to models trained with substantially more data,. These results demonstrate the critical role of high-quality, expert-driven datasets in advancing general-purpose computer-use agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "GroundCUA\ub294 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \uadf8\ub77c\uc6b4\ub529 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c, 87\uac1c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uacfc 12\uac1c \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, 3.56M\uac1c\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uac80\uc99d \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GroundCUA \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GroundCUA \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba85\ub839\uc5b4\ub97c UI \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\ub294 GroundNext \ubaa8\ub378\uad70\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GroundNext\ub294 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 10\ubd84\uc758 1 \uc774\ud558\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uae30\ubc18 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uadf8\ub77c\uc6b4\ub529\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uba85\ub839\uc5b4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud654\uba74 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6f9 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc778\uac04 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \uadf8\ub77c\uc6b4\ub529 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc778 GroundCUA\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 12\uac1c \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\uc758 87\uac1c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\uba70, \ucd1d 56K \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0\uc0f7\uacfc 356\ub9cc \uac1c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud655\uc778\ub41c \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba85\ub839\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
