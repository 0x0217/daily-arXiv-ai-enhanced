Their utility in traditional program analysis has been well established, enabling effective classification and analysis of malicious software. In the mobile domain, especially in the Android ecosystem, FCG-based malware classification is particularly critical due to the platform's widespread adoption and the complex, component-based structure of Android apps. However, progress in this direction is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality Android-specific FCG datasets. Existing datasets are often outdated, dominated by small or redundant graphs resulting from app repackaging, and fail to reflect the diversity of real-world malware. These limitations lead to overfitting and unreliable evaluation of graph-based classification methods. To address this gap, we introduce Better Call Graphs (BCG), a comprehensive dataset of large and unique FCGs extracted from recent Android application packages (APKs). BCG includes both benign and malicious samples spanning various families and types, along with graph-level features for each APK. Through extensive experiments using baseline classifiers, we demonstrate the necessity and value of BCG compared to existing datasets.

However, the reliability of these systems is critically undermined by their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, where attackers deliberately input deceptive instructions into LLMs. Traditional defenses, based on static filters and rigid rules, are insufficient to address the semantic complexity of these new attacks. We argue that a paradigm shift is needed -- from passive filtering to active protection and autonomous reasoning. We introduce AegisAgent, an autonomous agent system designed to ensure the security of LLM-driven HAR systems. Instead of merely blocking threats, AegisAgent functions as a cognitive guardian. It autonomously perceives potential semantic inconsistencies, reasons about the user's true intent by consulting a dynamic memory of past interactions, and acts by generating and executing a multi-step verification and repair plan. We implement AegisAgent as a lightweight, full-stack prototype and conduct a systematic evaluation on 15 common attacks with five state-of-the-art LLM-based HAR systems on three public datasets. Results show it reduces attack success rate by 30\\% on average while incurring only 78.6 ms of latency overhead on a GPU workstation.

Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts.

In operational technology (OT) environments, however, few methods exist for lateral movement between domain-specific devices, particularly programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Existing techniques often rely on complex chains of vulnerabilities, which are noisy and can be patched. This paper describes the first PLC-centric lateral movement technique that relies exclusively on the native functionality of the victim environment. This OT-specific form of `living off the land' is herein distinguished as `living off the plant' (LOTP). The described technique also facilitates escape from IP networks onto legacy serial networks via dual-homed PLCs. Furthermore, this technique is covert, leveraging common network communication functions that are challenging to detect. This serves as a reminder of the risks posed by LOTP techniques within OT, highlighting the need for a fundamental reconsideration of traditional OT defensive practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc6b4\uc601 \uae30\uc220 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c PLC \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uce21\uba74 \uc774\ub3d9 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uad00\ud589\uc758 \uc7ac\uace0 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc5c5 IT \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc0b0 \uac04 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uce21\uba74 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc804\uc220\uc774 \uc790\uc8fc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b4\uc601 \uae30\uc220 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 PLC\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc7a5\uce58 \uac04\uc758 \uc774\ub3d9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud53c\ud574\uc790 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc6d0\ub798 \uae30\ub2a5\ub9cc\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 PLC \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uce21\uba74 \uc774\ub3d9 \uae30\uc220\uc778 LOTP\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 IP \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub808\uac70\uc2dc \uc9c1\ub82c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\uc758 \uc774\ud0c8\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc740\ud3d0\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LOTP \uae30\uc220\uc774 OT \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc0c1\uae30\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 OT \ubc29\uc5b4 \uad00\ud589\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\uace0\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uacb0\ub860\uc9d3\ub294\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uce21\uba74 \uc774\ub3d9\uc740 \uc801\ub4e4\uc774 \uae30\uc5c5 IT \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc0b0 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc790\uc8fc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc804\uc220\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc6b4\uc601 \uae30\uc220(OT) \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc7a5\uce58, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\ube14 \ub85c\uc9c1 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec(PLC) \uac04\uc758 \uce21\uba74 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac70\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uc0ac\uc2ac\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc18c\uc74c\uc774 \ub9ce\uace0 \ud328\uce58\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud53c\ud574\uc790 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc6d0\ub798 \uae30\ub2a5\ub9cc\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 PLC \uc911\uc2ec \uce21\uba74 \uc774\ub3d9 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 OT \ud2b9\uc815 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 'living off the land'\ub294 'living off the plant'(LOTP)\ub85c \uad6c\ubcc4\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc30d \ud648 PLC\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 IP \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub808\uac70\uc2dc \uc9c1\ub82c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\uc758 \uc774\ud0c8\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc774 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc77c\ubc18 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc740\ud3d0\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 OT \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c LOTP \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc0c1\uae30\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 OT \ubc29\uc5b4 \uad00\ud589\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\uace0\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We present BitRL-Light, a novel framework combining 1-bit quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning for real-time smart home lighting control on edge devices. Our approach deploys a 1-bit quantized Llama-3.2-1B model on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 71.4 times energy reduction compared to full-precision models while maintaining intelligent control capabilities. Through multi-objective reinforcement learning, BitRL-Light learns optimal lighting policies from user feedback, balancing energy consumption, comfort, and circadian alignment. Experimental results demonstrate 32% energy savings compared to rule-based systems, with inference latency under 200ms on Raspberry Pi 4 and 95% user satisfaction. The system processes natural language commands via Google Home/IFTTT integration and learns from implicit feedback through manual overrides. Our comparative analysis shows 1-bit models achieve 5.07 times speedup over 2-bit alternatives on ARM processors while maintaining 92% task accuracy.

Code available at https://github.com/wltang-dev/Latent-Strategy-RL-Agent", "summary": "This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.\n  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098, \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uac15\ud654 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud589\ub3d9 \ub8e8\ud504\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub8e8\ud504\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc5ec \uc678\ubd80 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ub8e8\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc740 \ubc18\uc601 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc21c\uac04\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc678\ubd80 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9, \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud575\uc2ec \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\uc0c1 \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ud574\ubc29\uc2dc\ucf1c \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uac15\ud654 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub8e8\ud504\uc640 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub8e8\ud504\ub77c\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ub8e8\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc600\ub2e4: \ud589\ub3d9 \ub8e8\ud504\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub8e8\ud504\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc5ec \uc678\ubd80 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc740 \ubc18\uc601 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud558\uc5d0 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc21c\uac04\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uacf5\uc720 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uac10\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc554\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc678\ubd80 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9, \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4."}}

In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference.

CoTDeceptor autonomously constructs evolving, hard-to-reverse multi-stage obfuscation strategy chains that effectively disrupt CoT-driven detection logic.We obtained malicious code provided by security enterprise, experimental results demonstrate that CoTDeceptor achieves stable and transferable evasion performance against state-of-the-art LLMs and vulnerability detection agents.

We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness.

These autonomous agents often operate in trustless environments, where centralized coordination faces significant challenges, such as the inability to ensure transparent contribution measurement and equitable incentive distribution. While blockchain is frequently proposed as a decentralized coordination platform, it inherently introduces high on-chain computation costs and risks exposing sensitive execution information of the agents. Consequently, the core challenge lies in enabling auditable task execution and fair incentive distribution for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, while simultaneously preserving their strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs. To address this challenge, we propose DAO-Agent, a novel framework that integrates three key technical innovations: (1) an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging; (2) a ZKP mechanism approach that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that verifies ZKP-validated contribution measurements on-chain with minimal computational overhead. We implement DAO-Agent and conduct end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task as a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that DAO-Agent achieves up to 99.9% reduction in verification gas costs compared to naive on-chain alternatives, with constant-time verification complexity that remains stable as coalition size increases, thereby establishing a scalable foundation for agent coordination in decentralized environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8

I will begin my lecture with a short historical overview in which I sketch a development over time that led to this worry for the future of cybersecurity. It is this worry that determined my research agenda and its central theme of the role of uncertainty in cybersecurity. My worry is that waste is accumulating in cyberspace.

This paper presents AiAuditTrack (AAT), a blockchain-based framework for AI usage traffic recording and governance. AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities, and records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain to enable cross-system supervision and auditing. AI entities are modeled as nodes in a dynamic interaction graph, where edges represent time-specific behavioral trajectories.

This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology. This capability empowers decision makers to move beyond binary loss prediction and precisely target mitigation prioritizing vegetation management for high connectivity clusters and structural hardening for architecturally vulnerable nodes thereby operationalizing a proactive, data driven approach to community resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud654\uc7ac \uc704\ud5d8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\uc911 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud654\uc7ac\ub97c accurately \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud658\uacbd \uc804\uc5fc\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, GNN\uacfc XGBoost\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Eaton \ud654\uc7ac\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ud658\uacbd \uc555\ub825\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce68\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uace0, eaves\uac00 \uc8fc\uc694 \uce68\uc785 \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud654\uc7ac \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uc608\ubc29 \uc870\uce58\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc57c\uc0dd\ud654\uc7ac\uac00 \uc810\uc810 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud654\uc7ac\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uad6c\uc870\ubb3c\uc744 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \uc790\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc57c\uc0dd \ub300 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacbd\uacc4(WUI)\uc5d0 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc804\uc5fc \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ud658\uacbd \uc804\uc5fc\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \ubca1\ud130\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\uc911 \uc804\ubb38 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4\ud654\ub41c \ub300\ub958, \ubcf5\uc0ac \ubc0f \ubd88\uc528 \ud655\ub960\ub85c \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub41c \ube44\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uc804\uc5fc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub97c \uc791\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub274\ub7f4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(GNN)\uc640 \uc790\uc0b0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uace0\ub9bd\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 XGBoost\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uad6c\uc870 \uc804\ubb38\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ubb38 \uc608\uce21 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. 2025\ub144 \uc774\ud2bc \ud654\uc7ac\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\ubd84\ubc95\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4.

Such assistants are also termed LLM-driven agents. Upon receiving user requests, the LLM-driven agent generates plans using an LLM, executes these plans through various tools, and then returns the response to the user. During this process, the latency for generating a plan with an LLM can reach tens of seconds, significantly degrading user experience. Real-world dataset analysis shows that about 30% of the requests received by LLM-driven agents are identical or similar, which allows the reuse of previously generated plans to reduce latency. However, it is difficult to accurately define the similarity between the request texts received by the LLM-driven agent through directly evaluating the original request texts. Moreover, the diverse expressions of natural language and the unstructured format of plan texts make implementing plan reuse challenging. To address these issues, we present and implement a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents called AgentReuse. AgentReuse leverages the similarities and differences among requests' semantics and uses intent classification to evaluate the similarities between requests and enable the reuse of plans. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AgentReuse achieves a 93% effective plan reuse rate, an F1 score of 0.9718, and an accuracy of 0.9459 in evaluating request similarities, reducing latency by 93.12% compared with baselines without using the reuse mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uc778 \ube44\uc11c\uc758 \uc694\uccad \ucc98\ub9ac \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 AgentReuse\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uc778 \ube44\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud574\uacb0, IoT \uc7a5\uce58 \uad00\ub9ac \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentReuse\ub294 \uc694\uccad\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uacfc \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ub3c4 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc694\uccad \uac04\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\ud68d \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, AgentReuse\ub294 93%\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc694\uccad \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c F1 \uc810\uc218 0.9718\uacfc \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 0.9459\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uacc4\ud68d \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 93.12% \uc904\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 Xiao Ai \ubc0f Blue Heart V\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \ube44\uc11c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba74 \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, IoT \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\uc11c\ub97c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub77c\uace0\ub3c4 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ubc18\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac78\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc218\uc2ed \ucd08\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc218\uc2e0\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uccad\uc758 \uc57d 30%\uac00 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc218\uc2e0\ud55c \uc6d0\ubcf8 \uc694\uccad \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc694\uccad \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uae30\ub294 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud615\uc2dd \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uacc4\ud68d \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 AgentReuse\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The core idea of \\texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \\ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \\texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections.

This paper presents an AI-driven, modular multi-agent hiring assistant that integrates (i) document and video preprocessing, (ii) structured candidate profile construction, (iii) public-data verification, (iv) technical/culture-fit scoring with explicit risk penalties, and (v) human-in-the-loop validation via an interactive interface. The pipeline is orchestrated by an LLM under strict constraints to reduce output variability and to generate traceable component-level rationales. Candidate ranking is computed by a configurable aggregation of technical fit, culture fit, and normalized risk penalties. The system is evaluated on 64 real applicants for a mid-level Python backend engineer role, using an experienced recruiter as the reference baseline and a second, less experienced recruiter for additional comparison. Alongside precision/recall, we propose an efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate. In this study, the system improves throughput and achieves 1.70 hours per qualified candidate versus 3.33 hours for the experienced recruiter, with substantially lower estimated screening cost, while preserving a human decision-maker as the final authority.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucc44\uc6a9 \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc44\uc6a9 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc790\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \uac80\uc99d \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucc44\uc6a9 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub825\uc11c, \ud3c9\uac00 \ub2f5\ubcc0, \ucf54\ub4dc \uacfc\uc81c \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uacf5\uac1c \uc99d\uac70\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \ud070 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb38\uc11c \ubc0f \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud504\ub85c\ud544 \uad6c\ucd95, \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac80\uc99d, \uae30\uc220\uc801 \ubc0f \ubb38\ud654 \uc801\ud569\uc131 \uc810\uc218 \uacc4\uc0b0, \uc0ac\ub78c\uc758 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 AI \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \ucc44\uc6a9 \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "64\uba85\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc790\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \ucc44\uc6a9 \ub2f4\ub2f9\uc790\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc790\uaca9\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc790\ub2f9 1.70\uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc18c\uc694\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ucc44\uc6a9 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c \ucc44 \ucd5c\uc885 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uac80\uc99d\uc740 \uc774\ub825\uc11c, \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd \ub2f5\ubcc0, \ucf54\ub4dc \ud560\ub2f9 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uacf5\uac1c \uc99d\uac70\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ucc44\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 (i) \ubb38\uc11c \ubc0f \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac, (ii) \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud504\ub85c\ud544 \uad6c\ucd95, (iii) \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac80\uc99d, (iv) \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uae30\uc220/\ubb38\ud654 \uc801\ud569\uc131 \uc810\uc218 \uacc4\uc0b0, (v) \uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c AI \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucc44\uc6a9 \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ucd94\uc801 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uadfc\uac70\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0 LLM\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc870\uc728\ub41c\ub2e4. \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc790 \ub4f1\uae09\uc740 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc801\ud569\uc131, \ubb38\ud654\uc801 \uc801\ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uc704\ud5d8 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\uc758 \uad6c\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc911\uae09 Python \ubc31\uc5d4\ub4dc \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4 \uc5ed\ud560\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ucc44\uc6a9 \ub2f4\ub2f9\uc790\ub97c \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c 64\uba85\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc790\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ucd94\uac00 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub35c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \ucc44\uc6a9 \ub2f4\ub2f9\uc790\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4/\uc7ac\ud604\uc728\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc790\uaca9 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc790\ub2f9 \uc608\uc0c1 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc219\ub828\ub41c \ucc44\uc6a9 \ub2f4\ub2f9\uc790\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc790\uaca9 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc790\ub2f9 1.70\uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec 3.33\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc608\uc0c1 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ucd5c\uc885 \uacb0\uc815\uad8c\uc790\ub85c \uc778\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We investigate three levels of modeling for this task. First, we implement a heterogeneous GNN with attention-based message passing, establishing a strong neural baseline. Second, we propose FlowKANet in which Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks replace standard MLP layers, reducing trainable parameters while maintaining competitive predictive performance. FlowKANet integrates KAMP-Attn (Kolmogorov-Arnold Message Passing with Attention), embedding KAN operators directly into message-passing and attention computation. Finally, we distill the model into symbolic surrogate models using block-wise regression, producing closed-form equations that eliminate trainable weights while preserving graph-structured dependencies.

Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution.

However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c Adversarial Feedback for Attention (AFA) \ud6c8\ub828 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0ae\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "AFA \ud6c8\ub828 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc5c6\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ucd08\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ubd84\ubc30\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e8\uc5b4\ub97c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\ud558\uc5ec \ud310\ubcc4\uc790\ub97c \uc18d\uc774\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \ud6c8\ub828 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 12.6% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c4.", "translated_summary": "Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ub2a5\ub825 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uc8fc\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub35c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc6a9\uc5b4\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc5c6\uc774 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ucd08\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ubd84\ubc30\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 Adversarial Feedback for Attention (AFA) \ud6c8\ub828 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e8\uc5b4\ub97c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\ud558\uc5ec \ud310\ubcc4\uc790\ub97c \uc18d\uc774\ub824 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud310\ubcc4\uc790\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc12d\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uacbd\ub7c9\uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 12.6% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhances this process by enabling multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space - capabilities that traditional supervised learning methods lack. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations. This results in the generation of \\textit{de novo} drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, while ensuring 100\\% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking. This architecture highlights the potential of integrating structural biology, deep representation learning, and chemical synthesis rules to automate and accelerate rational drug design.

This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%. The findings indicate that the framework can locally combine affordability with nutritional adequacy and provide a viable avenue of capacity-building towards sustainable and fair diet planning in line with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac00\uacc4 \uc608\uc0b0 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \uc2dd\ub2e8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uac00\uaca9 \uc778\uc2dd AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc911\uac04 \uc18c\ub4dd \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dd\ud488 \uac00\uaca9 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uac00\uacc4 \uc608\uc0b0\uacfc \uc601\uc591 \uc694\uad6c\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uac00\uacc4 \uc18c\ub4dd, \uace0\uc815 \uc9c0\ucd9c, \uac74\uac15 \ubc0f \uc6f0\ube59 \uc0c1\ud0dc, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dd\ud488 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc601\uc591\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc2dd\uc0ac \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ube44\uad50\uc801 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0ac\uc6b0\ub514 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc815\uc801 \uc8fc\uac04 \uba54\ub274\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 12-18% \uc808\uac10\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \uc601\uc591 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc740 95% \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \uac00\uaca9 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc800\ub834\ud568\uacfc \uc601\uc591 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac1c\ubc1c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc2dd\ub2e8 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud55c\uc815\ub41c \uac00\uacc4 \uc608\uc0b0\uacfc \uc601\uc591 \uc218\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc2dd\ud488 \uac00\uaca9 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \uc18c\ub4dd \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac00\uacc4 \uc7ac\uc815 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \uc2dd\ub2e8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uac00\uaca9 \uc778\uc2dd \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac00\uacc4 \uc18c\ub4dd\uacfc \uace0\uc815 \uc9c0\ucd9c, \uc758\ub8cc \ubc0f \uc6f0\ube59 \uc0c1\ud0dc, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dd\ud488 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ub418\ub294 \ube44\uad50\uc801 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \uc601\uc591\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc2dd\uc0ac \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc608\uc0b0 \ucc45\uc815, \uc601\uc591, \uac00\uaca9 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1, \uac74\uac15 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uace0 \ub300\uccb4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc18c \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc601\uc591 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6b0\ub514 \uac00\uc815 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc815\uc801 \uc8fc\uac04 \uba54\ub274\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 12-18% \uc808\uac10\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \uc601\uc591 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc740 95% \uc774\uc0c1\uc774\uba70, \uac00\uaca9 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\ub834\ud568\uacfc \uc601\uc591 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\ub85c \ud5dd\uac70 \ubc0f \uc591\ud638\ud55c \uac74\uac15\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac1c\ubc1c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ubd80\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc2dd\ub2e8 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ed\ub7c9 \uad6c\ucd95\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc218\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c AgentMath\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LRM(\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc218\ud559 \uc5f0\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ub54c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentMath\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ucf54\ub4dc \ud574\uc11d\uae30\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc218\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AgentMath\ub294 AIME24, AIME25, HMMT25\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc218\ud559 \uacbd\uc9c4 \ub300\ud68c \uae30\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, AgentMath-30B-A3B\ub294 \uac01\uac01 90.6%, 86.4%, 73.8%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRM)\uc778 o3\uacfc DeepSeek-R1\uc740 \uae34 \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc5f0\uc1c4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\ub294 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc218\ud559 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ucf54\ub4dc \ud574\uc11d\uae30\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ub9e4\ub044\ub7fd\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc218\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AgentMath\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc5f0\uc1c4\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 \uada4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815(SFT) \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4;

Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ud544\uc801\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uad00\ub828 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc228\uae41\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud544\uc801\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uac00? \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uad00\ub828 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uc228\uaca8\uc838 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ud0edular \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub294 \uc798 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd80\ub3d9\uc0b0 \ubcf4\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubd84\uc11d \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub4a4\ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \"deliberative misalignment\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 AI

Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2e0\ud638\uc640 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uc798 \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc7a1\uc74c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 LLM \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ubc31\ub9cc \uac1c\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc218\uc900 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc7a1\uc74c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 all-pairs paired \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac01 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd1d \uc7a1\uc74c \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc30d \uc608\uce21 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc774 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \uc30d \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc7a1\uc74c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud06c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc870\uc808\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\ud638\uc640 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc798 \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc7a1\uc74c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc7a1\uc74c(\uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83), \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc7a1\uc74c(\uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83) \ubc0f \ucd1d \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubc95\uce59\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uacb0\ud569 \ucd1d \uc7a1\uc74c\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uce21\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud798\uc744 \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 LLM \uc30d\uc5d0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ubc31\ub9cc \uac1c\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc7a1\uc74c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 all-pairs paired \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uce21\uc815 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uac01 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc30d\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd1d \uc7a1\uc74c \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc30d \uc608\uce21 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc30d \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud798\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Current approaches rely on sequential adversarial training: generating adversarial prompts and fine-tuning LMs to defend against them. We introduce a different paradigm: framing safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between an Attacker LM and a Defender LM trained jointly via online reinforcement learning. Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. In addition, the resulting Attacker LM converges into a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent that can be directly deployed to probe arbitrary target models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 AI \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc30d \ube44\uad50\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9.", "result": "\uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc758 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ub3d9\uc2dc\ucf1c, \ub354\uc6b1 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18-purpose\uc758 \uc801 \ud300 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \ubc30\uce58\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LM)\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uadf8 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 AI \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ubc29\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d LM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 LM\uacfc \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790 LM \uac04\uc758 \ube44\uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 LM\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ub300\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc810\uc218 \uae30\uc900 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc30d \ube44\uad50\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub798\ub41c \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc870\uc791\uc744 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 RL \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c\uc778 AdvGame\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc758 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ub3d9\uc2dc\ucf1c, \ub354\uc6b1 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790 LM\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 LM\uc740 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \ub300\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc801 \ud300 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($\u03bb$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.",

This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($\u03b3$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $\u03b3$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[\u03b8]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.",

While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "TrafficSimAgent\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uacb0\uc815 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud560 \ub54c \ub9ce\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.", "method": "TrafficSimAgent\ub294 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \ubc0f \uc800\uc218\uc900 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TrafficSimAgent\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TrafficSimAgent\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc0f SOTA LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis.

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance.
