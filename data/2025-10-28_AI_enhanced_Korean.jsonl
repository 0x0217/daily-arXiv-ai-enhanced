Agentic systems have recently emerged as a promising tool to\nautomate literature-based ideation. However, current systems often remain\nblack-box. Their outputs may appear plausible but weakly grounded, with limited\ntransparency or control for researchers. Our work introduces\n\\textsc{autoresearcher}, a multi-agent demo system for knowledge-grounded and\ntransparent ideation. Specifically, \\textsc{autoresearcher} integrates\nmeticulously designed four stages into a unified framework: (A) Structured\nKnowledge Curation, (B) Diversified Idea Generation, (C) Multi-stage Idea\nSelection, and (D) Expert Panel Review \\& Synthesis. Different from prior\npipelines, our system not only exposes intermediate reasoning states, execution\nlogs, and tunable agents for inspections, but also enables the generation of\nhypotheses that are both diverse and evidence-aligned. Our design is also\ndomain-agnostic: as long as literature sources exist, the same pipeline can be\ninstantiated in any scientific field. As an illustrative case, we demonstrate\n\\textsc{autoresearcher} on a graph-mining case study ($k$-truss breaking\nproblem), where it generates distinct, plausible hypotheses with evidence and\ncritiques.

Current\nmassive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service\nexperiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address\nthese issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable\npersonalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale.\nConcretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier,\nagent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service\nexperiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while\nthe agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing\ndiverse agentic services.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze Suricata IDS logs and infer\nattacker actions in terms of MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Our approach is grounded\nin the hypothesis that attacker behavior reflects underlying cognitive biases\nsuch as loss aversion, risk tolerance, or goal persistence that can be\nextracted and modeled through careful observation of log sequences. This lays\nthe groundwork for future work on behaviorally adaptive cyber defense and\ncognitive trait inference. We develop a strategy-driven prompt system to\nsegment large amounts of network logs data into distinct behavioral phases in a\nhighly efficient manner, enabling the LLM to associate each phase with likely\ntechniques and underlying cognitive motives. By mapping network-layer events to\nhigh-level attacker strategies, our method reveals how behavioral signals such\nas tool switching, protocol transitions, or pivot patterns correspond to\npsychologically meaningful decision points. The results demonstrate that LLMs\ncan bridge the semantic gap between packet-level logs and strategic intent,\noffering a pathway toward cognitive-adaptive cyber defense.\n  Keywords: Cognitive

However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic\ntasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have\nemerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability\nthrough tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.\nHowever, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack\nmechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and\ncredibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,\nmulti-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates\nthe following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates\na set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the\nEvidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual\nevidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:\nGuided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a\ntargeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,\ndefining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive\nand collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent\nintegrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,\nsynthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on\nvarious CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong\nperformance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks\nof different complexity.

To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective\niterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our\nmethod repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise\nagent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten,\nmasked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until\nthe input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative\ninstruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By\nallowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites\nmay fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later\nsteps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not\ninfallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding\nnon-imperative workflows.

We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien\nSampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates\ncompositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models\nfine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether\nconcepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that\nestimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies\nof work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in\ntypicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating\nfrom learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation\n(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and\nachieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived\noriginality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our\nmethod produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space\nthan its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness\ncan unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubb38\ud654 \uad00\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub3c5\ucc3d\uc801\uc778 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubb38\ud654 \uc774\uc9c8 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub7ec(CAS)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc608\uc220\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c5\ucc3d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CAS\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 GPT-2 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uacfc \ubb38\ud654 \uc804\ud615\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f GPT-4o \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uc2dd\ub41c \ub3c5\ucc3d\uc131\uacfc \uc870\ud654 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ubbf8\uc220 \ud559\uc0dd\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc778\uacf5 \ubb38\ud654 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucc3d\uc758\uc801 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc5f4 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc608\uc220\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c5\ucc3d\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc775\uc219\ud55c \ubb38\ud654 \ud328\ud134\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\uadc0\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub3c5\ucc3d\uc131 \ucabd\uc73c\ub85c \ubc00\uc5b4\ubd99\uc77c \ub54c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\ud654 \uc774\uc9c8 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub7ec(CAS)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The Model Context\nProtocol (MCP) has become the de facto standard for connecting agents with such\nresources, but security has lagged behind: thousands of MCP servers execute\nwith unrestricted access to host systems, creating a broad attack surface. In\nthis paper, we introduce AgentBound, the first access control framework for MCP\nservers. AgentBound combines a declarative policy mechanism, inspired by the\nAndroid permission model, with a policy enforcement engine that contains\nmalicious behavior without requiring MCP server modifications. We build a\ndataset containing the 296 most popular MCP servers, and show that access\ncontrol policies can be generated automatically from source code with 80.9%\naccuracy.

While Large Language Models (LLMs)\noffer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),\nsingle-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic\ncomplexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent\nframework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into\nspatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,\nincluding a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic\nenrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent\npipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity\nextraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a\nreview agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the\ngenerated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system\nusing both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive\nSpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and\nthree levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall\naccuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review\nand corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy\nof 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review\nagent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system\ngenerates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than\nthose in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and\nprovides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,\nadvancing the development of autonomous GIS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uacf5\uac04 SQL \ucffc\ub9ac\ub85c \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \uacf5\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 SQL\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc PostGIS\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uacf5\uac04 \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc774 \ud070 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uacf5\uac04 SQL \ucffc\ub9ac\ub85c \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18, \uc784\ubca0\ub529, \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "KaggleDBQA\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 81.2%\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uacf5\uac04 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub9ac\ubdf0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\uc744 \ub54c 87.7%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0, \uc790\uc728 GIS \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc5b8\uc5b4(SQL)\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc PostGIS\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uacf5\uac04 \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc740 \uacf5\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uac8c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub97c SQL\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uacf5\uac04 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubc0f \uad6c\ubb38\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uacf5\uac04 SQL \ucffc\ub9ac\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc801 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8 \ud48d\ubd80\ud654\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18, \ubb38\ub9e5 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud575\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0 \ucd94\ucd9c, \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac80\uc0c9, \ucffc\ub9ac \ub17c\ub9ac \uc218\ub9bd, SQL \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c SQL\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub9ac\ubdf0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uacf5\uac04 KaggleDBQA \uae30\uc900\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc720\ud615, \uc220\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ucffc\ub9ac \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 SpatialQueryQA \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing graph-based\nspatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph\ntopologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt\nwhen market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit\ncontagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.\n  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal\nPatterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes\nspatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics\nvia BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through\nmulti-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP\ndiscovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,\nfiltering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant\ndependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.\n  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP\ndemonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a\nfundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate\ncorrelation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that\nmaintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%\nimprovement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph\nmethods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with\ndefensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%\nmarket-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast

Maximising attacker\nengagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that\ncontext-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems\nand attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer\nfrom several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time,\nhigh operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We\npropose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which\nmanages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We\ninvestigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and\nnon-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different\nmetrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and\nsimilarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and\nBertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models\nthat have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a\nLinux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while\nhaving a slightly lower latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud574\ud0b9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc9d1\uc911 \uc258 \ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(SBASH)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc120 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SBASH \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub85c\uceec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "RAG\ub85c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\ub294 LLM\uacfc \ube44-RAG LLM\uc744 \ub9ac\ub205\uc2a4 \uc258 \uba85\ub839\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc870\uc815\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 RAG\uac00 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 RAG\uc5c6\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f\uc740 \uac00\uce58 \uc788\ub294 \uc704\ud611 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub97c \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uba40\uc5b4\uc9c0\uac8c \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc720\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ub294 \uadf8 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc720\ud615, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc0f \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc751\ub2f5 \uc2dc\uac04\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2dc\uc758\uc131, \ub192\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ubc30\ud3ec\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub85c\uceec LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uae30\ubc18 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc9d1\uc911 \uc258 \ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f(SBASH) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ac\ub205\uc2a4 \uc258 \uba85\ub839\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 RAG \uc9c0\uc6d0 LLM\uacfc \ube44-RAG LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc28\uc774, \uc778\uac04 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud130\uc758 \ud604\uc2e4\uac10, \ub808\ubca4\uc288\ud0c0\uc778 \uac70\ub9ac, SBert \ubc0f BertScore\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RAG\uac00 \uc870\uc815\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, LLM\uc5d0\uac8c \ub9ac\ub205\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ucc98\ub7fc \uc751\ub2f5\ud558\ub77c\uace0 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 RAG \uc5c6\uc774 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc57d\uac04 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

By incorporating local environmental factors and\noperationalizing multi agent coordination, this approach offers a scalable and\nproactive solution for climate resilient disaster preparedness across\nvulnerable mountainous terrains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c0\uc9c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc704\uc131 \uad00\uce21\uacfc \ud658\uacbd \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 CC-GRMAS\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uc0b0 \uc544\uc2dc\uc544\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ud6c4\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc7ac\ud574\uc778 \uc0b0\uc0ac\ud0dc\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc7ac\ub09c \ub300\uc751\uc774 \ubbf8\ud761\ud558\uc5ec \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc801 \ubc0f \uc778\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc608\uce21, \uacc4\ud68d, \uc2e4\ud589\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd, \ub300\uc751 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc9c0\uc5ed \ud658\uacbd \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc870\ub97c \uc6b4\uc601\ud654\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc0b0\uc545 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ud6c4 \ud68c\ubcf5 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\ub09c \ub300\ube44\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CC-GRMAS\ub294 \uc0b0\uc0ac\ud0dc \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uac15\ud55c \uc7ac\ub09c \ub300\ucc98\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0b0\uc0ac\ud0dc\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc801 \ubc0f \uc778\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uae30\ud6c4 \uc720\ubc1c \uc7ac\ud574\ub85c, \ud2b9\ud788 \uace0\uc0b0 \uc544\uc2dc\uc544\uc5d0\uc11c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc704\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc7ac\ub09c \ub300\uc751\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubbf8\ube44\ud558\uace0 \ud30c\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc0b0\uc0ac\ud0dc \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uc704\uc131 \uad00\uce21 \ubc0f \ud658\uacbd \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 CC-GRMAS\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc608\uce21, \uacc4\ud68d, \uc2e4\ud589\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd, \ub300\uc751 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud658\uacbd \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc870\ub97c \uc6b4\uc601\ud654\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc0b0\uc545 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ud6c4 \ud68c\ubcf5 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\ub09c \ub300\ube44\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents\nRAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory\nconsumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by\nprecomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them\non-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV\nchunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware\nRAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical\ndistribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision\ncompressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.\nSecond, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes\nstoring frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data\naccess efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with\nTurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum\nspeedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 RAG \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c HA-RAG \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc5b5 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Large Language Models(LLMs)\uc758 \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c RAG\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "KV\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ube48\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f \ub85c\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubc0f \uc5f4\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc30\uce58 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "HA-RAG\ub294 TurboRAG\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 2.10\ubc30, \ucd5c\ub300 10.49\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c HA-RAG \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 RAG \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG)\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \ub3c4\uc785\uc740 RAG\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc18c\ube44\uc640 \ucd94\ub860 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 Key \ubc0f Value(KV)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc911\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub85c\ub4dc\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \ub0b4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c KV \uccad\ud06c\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ube48\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5f4\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd RAG(HA-RAG) \ucd94\ub860 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, KV \uccad\ud06c\uc758 \uc22b\uc790 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub514\uc2a4\ud06c I/O \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc5f4\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f \ub85c\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc790\uc8fc \uc811\uadfc\ud558\ub294 KV \uccad\ud06c\ub97c \uace0\uc18d \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc5f4\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc30\uce58 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c HA-RAG\ub294 TurboRAG\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 Time-To-First-Token(TTFT)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 2.10\ubc30, \ucd5c\ub300 10.49\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc740 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable\non complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate\n(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs\nprovide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.\nHowever, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the\ndebaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it\nleads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting\nthe task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and\nunderperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new\ncollaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum\ngame.

Ensuring fairness\nguarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward\nspecific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally\nintroduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence\nfairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream\nprediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\\epsilon$, with\n*controllable* high probability.

Code would be available at\n  https://github.com/scope-lab-vu/ESCORT", "summary": "In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and\nupdating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a\nprincipled way to summarize action-observation history for effective\ndecision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief\ndistributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot\naccurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining\nrepresentational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic\nmodeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately\nrepresent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal\nbelief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal\nagent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient\nStein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal\nbeliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal\ndistributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two\nkey innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between\nstate dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates\nwhile preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's\nattractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of\nintricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or\nparametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically\nadapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive\ndistributional assumptions.

However, LLM agents can exhibit\nunpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In\norder to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions\nunder an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable\nhuman-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms\nin situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our\nbenchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,\nbias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing\nfor both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.\nComparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by\ncitations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of\nfrontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing\nthe relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with\nexplicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the\nresearch community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data\ncontamination in evaluating upcoming models.

Co-Sight\naddresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable\nprocess through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification\n(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV\nreformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted\nfalsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among\nexpert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification\ncost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.\nTRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents\nthrough a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and\nauditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,\nsource-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout\nthe reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,\nwhere TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or\nreinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,\nCo-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last\nExam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies\nconfirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and\nconflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a\nscalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents.

These conventional metrics often fail\nto address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings\nwhere rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical\ntrials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,\nwhich evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,\naligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness\naxioms.\n  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm\ndesigns and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration\ninequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even\nGaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform\nexploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm\nachieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding\nbounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we\ngeneralize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the\n$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all\n$p$ values.

They grow a tree of self-modifications through\nexpansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark\nperformance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent\nself-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's\nself-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark\nperformance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by\nHuxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates\nthe benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of\nits potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding\nagent development setting, access to the true $\\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to\nsimulate how the G\\\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We\nintroduce the Huxley-G\\\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\\mathrm{CMP}$\nand using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench\nVerified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent\ndevelopment methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM\ndemonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language\nmodels.

Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,\nwhich limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce\nDeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous\nthinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent\nreasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,\nparticularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the\naccumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding\nmechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,\nand tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical\ninformation. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we\ndevelop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that\nleverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to\nassign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments\non eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,\nTMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,\nHLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both\nlabeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios.

Problems impeding\nthe practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch\nstreams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online\ntask-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in\nlearning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient\ndecision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a\nrandomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is\nproposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general\nframework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,\nhas no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)\nin OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep\nrandom vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward\nregularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.\nedRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable\nlearning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting\nwhile achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties\ncaused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve\nit to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple\nsub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.\nExperiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic\nperformance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the\nefficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \ud504\ub9ac \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc810\uc9c4 \ud559\uc2b5(OTCIL) \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \uc78a\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub79c\ub364\ud654\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc810\uc9c4 \ud559\uc2b5(CIL)\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ub79c\ub364\ud654\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(Randomized NN)\uacfc \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801 \uc815\uaddc\ud654(-F)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc78a\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9bc\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c edRVFL-kF \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacfc\uac70 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uacfc \ud30c\uad6d\uc801 \uc78a\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9bc\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 OTCIL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 -kF-Bayes \ubc0f -kF \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \ud655\uc2e4\ud788 \uac80\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5(CIL)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc78a\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9bc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc720\uc9c0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Rigorous evaluation of\nthese agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on\nseveral fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of\nreal-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent\ntools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)\ndo not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;\n(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and\nevaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify\ntrue advances.

Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that\nprovides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific\nresearch, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery\nprocess and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired\nby actual user requests to deployed Asta agents.

Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological\nsystems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable\nalternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive\nneuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations\nevolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern\nconsistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately\nsimilar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of\nLLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of\nassociated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary\ninterference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We\nfind that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting\nthat representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global\ncompetition.

This allows complex, coordinated paths to be\nmodified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous\nUnderwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the\nend-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative\npolicies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes.

Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that\nprovably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its\ndynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations\n(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating\nvalue functions to $\\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on\ngraphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source\ndomains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few\ntrajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted\npolicy.

However, fully realizing the\npotential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including\ncoordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,\nmodeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling\nreal-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid\nvariables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical\nSAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices\n(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD\ncost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by\njointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,\ncomputing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an\nNP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game\n(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to\noptimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the\npartially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex\noptimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional\nMADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional\ndecisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG\nalgorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the\naggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a\nslight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark\nalgorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence\nstability and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacf5\uac04-\uacf5\uc911-\uc9c0\uc0c1 \ud1b5\ud569 \ub2e4\uc911

In this work, we analyze the\nproblem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader\nand more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP\nalgorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network\nabstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for\ncomputing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary\nstructures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor\nTrain (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*\ntime using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,\nthis complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such\nas decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore\ntightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.\nFinally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor\nNetwork representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become\n*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains\ncomputationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important\ninsight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the\nprimary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHAP \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ud150\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(TN)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c SHAP \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub354 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c SHAP \uc124\uba85\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 NP \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc5d0 \ube60\uc9c0\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud150\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c SHAP \uc124\uba85 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc784\uc758\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc77c\ubc18 TN\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c SHAP \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \ud150\uc11c \uae30\ucc28(TT) \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub420 \ub54c poly-logarithmic \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c SHAP \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud150\uc11c \uae30\ucc28\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0, \uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac, \ud2b8\ub9ac \uc559\uc0c1\ube14, \uc120\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \uc120\ud615 RNN\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 ML \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub108\ube44\uac00 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 SHAP \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae4a\uc774\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uae4a\uc5b4\ub3c4 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\ub85d Shapley \uac00\ubc95 \uc124\uba85(SHAP)\uc740 \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ud56d\uc2dd \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 NP-\uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c0\ub294 \ubd88\ud589\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c SHAP \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uace0 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc778 \ud150\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(TNs)\uc5d0\uc11c SHAP \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc77c\ubc18 TN\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud655\uc2e4\ud788 \uc815\ud655\ud55c SHAP \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud765\ubbf8\ub86d\uac8c\ub3c4, TN\uc774 \ud150\uc11c \uae30\ucc28(TT) \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub420 \ub54c, SHAP \uacc4\uc0b0\uc740 \ubcd1\ub82c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud14c\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec poly-logarithmic \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc218\ud589\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.
