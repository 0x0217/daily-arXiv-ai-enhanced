While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising\navenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing\nsingular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support\nwithout systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological\nframework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic\nAlzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of\na collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address\na distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and\nmultimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data\ninterpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized,\ninteroperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver\nand Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced\nMultimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of\neach agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large\nlanguage models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration\nframeworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded\nresponses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing,\nand in-memory database querying. This paper presents a detailed architectural\nblueprint for an integrated AI ecosystem for AD care. By moving beyond\nsingle-purpose tools to a collaborative, multi-agent paradigm, this framework\nestablishes a foundation for developing more adaptive, personalized, and\nproactive solutions. This methodological approach aims to pave the way for\nfuture systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient\noutcomes and reduce caregiver burden.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

This work is the first to\nintroduce GRPO into spatial public goods games, establishing a new deep\nreinforcement learning baseline for structured populations. GRPO-GCC integrates\ngroup relative policy optimization with a global cooperation constraint that\nstrengthens incentives at intermediate cooperation levels while weakening them\nat extremes. This mechanism aligns local decision making with sustainable\ncollective outcomes and prevents collapse into either universal defection or\nunconditional cooperation. The framework advances beyond existing approaches by\ncombining group-normalized advantage estimation, a reference-anchored KL\npenalty, and a global incentive term that dynamically adjusts cooperative\npayoffs. As a result, it achieves accelerated cooperation onset, stabilized\npolicy adaptation, and long-term sustainability.

Traditional centralized algorithms that have global\ninformation, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality\nsolutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to\nthe combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely,\ndistributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based\nmethods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information\navailability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path\nplanning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to\nadapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static\nconflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared\ninformation from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We\nempirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its\nplanning performance.

The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal\nFulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan\nAdherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent\nwith its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes\nin the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an\nagent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's\nactions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's\nfinal outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two\nbenchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for\na production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a\nsystematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent\nerrors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that\nexhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%\nerrors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted\nimprovement of agent performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Agent GPA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc124\uc815, \uacc4\ud68d \uc218\ub9bd \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Agent GPA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub2ec\uc131, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uc2e4\ud589 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uacc4\ud68d \ud488\uc9c8 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d \uc900\uc218\uc758 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2e4\ud328\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc124\uc815\uacfc \uc5d0\ub7ec \ub85c\uceec\ub77c\uc774\uc9d5 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec, LLM-\ud310\ubcc4\uc790\uc640 \uac15\ud55c \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Agent GPA(\ubaa9\ud45c-\uacc4\ud68d-\ud589\ub3d9) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubaa9\ud45c \uc124\uc815, \uacc4\ud68d \uc218\ub9bd, \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2e4\ud589\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub2ec\uc131, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uc2e4\ud589 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uacc4\ud68d \ud488\uc9c8 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d \uc900\uc218\uc758 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc774\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud589 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacc4\ud68d \ud488\uc9c8\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uba70, \uacc4\ud68d \uc900\uc218\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa9\ud45c \ub2ec\uc131\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd5c\uc885 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uba85\uc2dc\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uacf5 TRAIL/GAIA \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ub4f1\uae09 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 (a) TRAIL/GAIA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc0c1\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8f0 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, (b) \uc0ac\ub78c \uc8fc\uc11d\uacfc \uac15\ud55c \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 LLM-\ud310\ubcc4\uc790\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70 80%\uc5d0\uc11c 95% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\uace0, (c) 86%\uc758 \ud569\uc758\ub85c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ub85c\uceec\ub77c\uc774\uc9d5\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While post-quantum security of public-key cryptography has received\nsignificant attention, the case of symmetric-key cryptography (and block\nciphers in particular) remains a largely unexplored topic. In this work, we set\nthe foundations for a theory of post-quantum security for block ciphers and\nassociated constructions. Leveraging our new techniques, we provide the first\npost-quantum security proofs for the key-length extension scheme FX, the\ntweakable block ciphers LRW and XEX, and most block cipher encryption and\nauthentication modes.

Current state-of-the-art\napproaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation\nplanning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and\nlimited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this\nfundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world\nmodel integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single\nmultimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly\ngrounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight\nalignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism\nfurther integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term\ntrajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.\nExtensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,\nSCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success\nrates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong\nbaselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen\nTartanDrive dataset.

Due to the context-dependent nature of attacks, however, current\ndefenses are often ill-calibrated as they cannot reliably differentiate\nmalicious and benign instructions, leading to high false positive rates that\nprevent their real-world adoption. To address this, we present a novel approach\ninspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not\ncontain executable instructions. Instead of sample-level classification, we\npropose a token-level sanitization process, which surgically removes any\ninstructions directed at AI systems from tool outputs, capturing malicious\ninstructions as a byproduct. In contrast to existing safety classifiers, this\napproach is non-blocking, does not require calibration, and is agnostic to the\ncontext of tool outputs. Further, we can train such token-level predictors with\nreadily available instruction-tuning data only, and don't have to rely on\nunrealistic prompt injection examples from challenges or of other synthetic\norigin. In our experiments, we find that this approach generalizes well across\na wide range of attacks and benchmarks like AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, ASB\nand SEP, achieving a 7-10x reduction of attack success rate (ASR) (34% to 3% on\nAgentDojo), without impairing agent utility in both benign and malicious\nsettings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uba74\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uac04\uc811 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \uba74\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud655\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc138\ucc99 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c 7-10\ubc30\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac \ube44\ucc28\ub2e8\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc218\ub9ce\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uac04\uc811 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \uba74\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud655\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc758\uc874\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ubc0f \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uad6c\ubd84\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc5b4 \ub192\uc740 \uc624\ud0d0\uc9c0\uc728\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4: \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud45c\ubcf8 \uc218\uc900 \ubd84\ub958 \ub300\uc2e0\uc5d0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \uc678\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc758\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ubd80\uc218\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc138\ucc99 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\ucc28\ub2e8\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ubcf4\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc190\uc27d\uac8c \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc870\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ub9cc \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900 \uc608\uce21\uae30\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucc4c\ub9b0\uc9c0\ub098 \uae30\ud0c0 \ud569\uc131 \ucd9c\ucc98\uc758 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uc608\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, ASB, SEP\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uba70 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960(ASR)\uc744 7-10\ubc30 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf1c(AgentDojo\uc5d0\uc11c 34%\uc5d0\uc11c 3%\ub85c) \uc120\ub7c9\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uacfc \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4."}}

Unlike standard\nsupervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning\nfor each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at\ninference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers\nare primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context\nwindow. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical\nstudies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function\nremains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of\nICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel\nequalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient\nattention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,\nleveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.\nFor example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square\n(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for\nenhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term\ntracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for\nnon-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by\nclassical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and\nperformance in dynamic environments.

We\nidentify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories\ncause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant\ninformation, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To\naddress this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and\nStrategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical\nexecution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized\ncomponents: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a\nMeta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)\na Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for\ndifferent reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,\nBrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%\nrelative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a\ntest-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established\nDeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context\nmanagement to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "COMPASS\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uac10\ub3c5\uacfc \ub9e5\ub77d \uc870\uc9c1\uc744 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae34 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ub204\uc801\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "COMPASS\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c(\uc8fc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uba54\ud0c0 \uc53d\ucee4, \ub9e5\ub77d \uad00\ub9ac\uc790)\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "COMPASS\ub294 GAIA, BrowseComp, Humanity's Last Exam\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 20% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "COMPASS\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6c4 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uae34 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc791\uc740 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ub204\uc801\ub418\uace0, \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4 \uc885\uc885 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc783\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \uc911\uc559 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \uc774\ub825\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uac70\ub098 \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uc0b0\ub9cc\ud574\uc838 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc2e4\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\uacc4\ud68d\uc774\ub098 \ubc18\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 COMPASS(\ub9e5\ub77d \uc870\uc9c1\ud654 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc804\uc220 \uc2e4\ud589, \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubc0f \ub9e5\ub77d \uc870\uc9c1\uc744 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4: 1) \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uba54\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, 2) \uc9c4\ud589 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ubc1c\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc2f1\ucee4, 3) \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac04\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c4\ud589 \ube0c\ub9ac\ud551\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d \uad00\ub9ac\uc790.

The usage of tool-calling and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\nallows LLMs to process and retrieve sensitive corporate data, amplifying both\ntheir functionality and vulnerability to abuse. As LLMs increasingly interact\nwith external data sources, indirect prompt injection emerges as a critical and\nevolving attack vector, enabling adversaries to exploit models through\nmanipulated inputs. Through a systematic evaluation of indirect prompt\ninjection attacks across diverse models, we analyze how susceptible current\nLLMs are to such attacks, which parameters, including model size and\nmanufacturer, specific implementations, shape their vulnerability, and which\nattack methods remain most effective. Our results reveal that even well-known\nattack patterns continue to succeed, exposing persistent weaknesses in model\ndefenses. To address these vulnerabilities, we emphasize the need for\nstrengthened training procedures to enhance inherent resilience, a centralized\ndatabase of known attack vectors to enable proactive defense, and a unified\ntesting framework to ensure continuous security validation.

The deficiency of these methods,\nhowever, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them\nuntrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in\npopularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the\noriginal features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a\nSHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction\nof that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data\nby grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received\nthe same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various\npathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To\nshowcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a\ncase study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

Moreover, they frequently lack\ninterpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause\nanomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \\textsf{\\textbf{RFOD}}, a\nnovel \\textsf{\\textbf{R}}andom \\textsf{\\textbf{F}}orest-based\n\\textsf{\\textbf{O}}utlier \\textsf{\\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for\ntabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \\textsf{RFOD}\nreframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction\nproblem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the\nothers. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving\nthe semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and\ninterpretable detection, \\textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)\nfor cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for\ncategorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate\ncell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores.

Prior work treats this as a\nsecurity problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context\nto subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,\nmost AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can\nbecome a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted\nmodel that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the\nuntrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for\nthis information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector\nby which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in\nthe model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade\ndiverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control\nbenchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on\na monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,\nas its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as\na best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent\na major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard\ncomponent of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.",

While existing methods\ntypically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply\nconnected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging\nthis insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that\nreconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a\nconditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates\ncausal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables\nnonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak\nassumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the\nlatent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial\nconfounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial\nDeconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets\nin environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a\nmulti-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures\nto advance robust causal inference in structured data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacf5\uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf5\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 Spatial Deconfounder\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacf5\uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c, \uce21\uc815\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uacfc \uc778\uc811 \uce58\ub8cc\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac04\uc12d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Spatial Deconfounder\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uce58\ub8cc \ubca1\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uccb4 \uad50\ub780 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uac04 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ubcc0\ubcc4 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(CVAE)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ud6c4 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc57d\ud55c \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc9c1\uc811 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud544\uc624\ubc84 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc758 \ube44\ubaa8\uc218\uc801 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \ud658\uacbd \uac74\uac15 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \ub2e4\uc6d0\uc801 \uc6d0\uc778 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uad50\ub780 \uad50\ub780 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacf5\uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uacc4\ub7c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uacf5\uac04 \uc694\uc778(\uc608: \ub0a0\uc528, \ub300\uae30 \uc624\uc5fc \ub610\ub294 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131)\uacfc \uc778\uc811 \uce58\ub8cc\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac04\uc12d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5bd\ud78c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ub450 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uae4a\uac8c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uac04\uc12d\uc740 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ub780 \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uac04 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ubcc0\ubcc4 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(CVAE)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed \uce58\ub8cc \ubca1\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uccb4 \uad50\ub780 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Spatial Deconfounder\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uce58\ub8cc \uc720\ud615\uc774\ub098 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud544\ub4dc\uc758 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc57d\ud55c \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud544\uc624\ubc84 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc758 \ube44\ubaa8\uc218\uc801 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uac04 \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubaa8\uc74c\uc778 SpaCE\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uce58\ub8cc \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0, Spatial Deconfounder\uac00 \ud658\uacbd \uac74\uac15 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc774\ub8ec\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \ub2e4\uc6d0\uc801 \uc6d0\uc778 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \uad50\ub780 \uad50\ub780 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc9c4\uc804\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an\nentity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG\nextracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a\nlightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\\% compared to\nother structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue\nentities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search\nacross the knowledge graph.

However, due to the\ncomplex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,\ntraditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of\nthese parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel\nmethodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to\noptimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were\nimaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT\nreconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,\ntube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The\noptimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\nagent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically\nthe detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.\nOptimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on\na supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the\nglobal maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the\nexhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.\nThe proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality\nobjectives.

However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak\nevidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we\npropose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the\nepistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two\ncomplementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background\nknowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each\ngraph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion\nfor breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for\ndepth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,\nDualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and\nfuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The\nfusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a\ncomplement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool\nexecution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can\nreconstruct answers stably and effectively.

Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural\nknowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL\nexploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL\npolicies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward\nfunctions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action\nrecommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to\nlearn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world\nknowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft\nconstraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of\nincreasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with\ntask difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative\nimprovement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides\nsubstantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance\nthresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL\nalgorithms.

Given this progress, we assess how\nwell these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,\nand assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis\ncapabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we\ngrade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution\nsets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models\ncan reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit\ncalibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we\nintroduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and\nautomatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.\nWe instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,\nand evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our\nproposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more\nconsistent handling of partial credit across metrics.

We model successful pulling of\npublic suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability\ndecreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at\na $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin\nproblem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the\noptimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose\nan algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts\nits exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public\nsuboptimality gaps.

As memory size and\nretrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text\nmemories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we\nintroduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via\nsearch, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out\ntrajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using\nthis pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \\$4000 and fine-tune\nonly the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\\% parameters) with 1,500\nsamples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently\nimproves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,\nQwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).", "AI": {"tldr": "GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0

In this work, we present a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to\nensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite\nthe system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone\nenvironment.

Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced\nCodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs\nwithout fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes.

We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus\nsystem, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs\nto complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with\nclass-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage\nin structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted\nconsensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle\nDegeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and\npreventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on\nCodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving\nat least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini\nin macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to\nGPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average.

Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the\nfairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image\ndiagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked\nprognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression\nof a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,\nthe first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)\nprediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging\nmodalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and\nfairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness\nin medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE\nuncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical\nimaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive\nacross different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer\nlimited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between\nunderlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for\nholistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that\nfairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,\nunderscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for\nmore robust, equitable prognostic models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04-\uc0ac\uac74 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc885\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FairTTE\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\ud68c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "FairTTE\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc640 TTE \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba70, \ucca8\ub2e8 TTE \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \ub9cc\uc5f0\ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc644\ud654 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc2dc\uae09\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\ud68c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

However, the performance of graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical\nstudy shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant\ndegradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and\nimbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing\napproaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting\nsystematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in\npractice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph\nAgent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a\nfirst-class, data-centric problem.

It holds paramount\nsignificance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most\nexisting studies are constrained by the \\textbf{Pseudo De Novo},\n\\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \\textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To\naddress these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework\ngrounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)\nWe adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general\ndocking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone\nmodel. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient\nflows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of\nligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking\nprocess, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely\ncapture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve\ndocking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints.

This pursuit has\nrecently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,\nfollow instructions, and perform forms of \"reasoning\" and planning across a\nwide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated\nworkflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit\nfrom agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex\ntasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already\ndemonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information\nextraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation\nunderutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where\ndecisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.\nEquipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to\ndrive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated\nworkflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes.

To address these issues, we propose Intelligent\nGeneral-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel\nrobust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted\nadversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is\ndesigned to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to\nexecute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it\nexplicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum\nobjective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to\ndevelop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To\nensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift\ncaused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.\nExtensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least\n27.9\\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to\nadversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based\nautonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758

However, despite this shift, prompt\noptimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt\ncrafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately\nlimiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the\nnew problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior\ndefinition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs\nof textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the\nMultimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs\nthe joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving\nupdates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by\nleveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection\nstrategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go\nbeyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that\nMPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal\nprompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30(MPO)\ub77c\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MLLM\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300\ud55c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "MPO\ub294 \uc815\ub82c \ubcf4\uc874 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MPO\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ube44\ub514\uc624, \ubd84\uc790 \ub4f1\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 MLLM\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud655\uc7a5(MLLM)\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub354 \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc218\ub3d9 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc791\uc131\uc758 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 MLLM\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \ube44\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc30d\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc815\uc758\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ub82c \ubcf4\uc874 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uae30\ubc18 \uc120\ud0dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30(MPO)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc790\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, MPO\ub294 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uc5ec MLLM\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)\nof the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a\nsupervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous\nsolutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather\nthan averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus\nsystem, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to\nconventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through\nerror control mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ub300\uccb4\ubb3c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\ub9ac\uce74 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub300\uc218\uc801 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \uad50\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uc794\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uc218\uc801 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud53c\ub4dc\ud3ec\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\uc218\uc801 \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \uc794\uc5ec(\uc624\ucc28)\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "IEEE 14-\ubc84\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc744 \ub54c, \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 60%\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc624\ub958 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 Modelica \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uc218\uc801 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ub300\uccb4\ubb3c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc794\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud53c\ub4dc\ud3ec\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \uc794\uc5ec(\uc624\ucc28)\ub97c \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uac10\ub3c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uccb4\ubb3c\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 IEEE 14-\ubc84\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc744 \ub54c, \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 60%\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc624\ub958 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In the\nnon-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the\nall-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity\nmeasure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal.

Recent efforts toward\ninference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume\naccess to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third\nparty stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we\npropose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does\nnot require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof\nof concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but\nuninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate\nthis dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures\nthe optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize\nthis framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to\ncompute equilibrium strategies.

While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in\nextracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by\nreceiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise\ntransmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and\nreceiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel\nnoise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the\nRFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is\nparticularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,\nas replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance\ndegradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to\ncross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer\nto explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing\ndomain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware\nsignatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver\nchanges. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our\napproach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a\n10% improvement in average accuracy across

Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of\nonline interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We\naddress these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and\nestablish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under\ngeneral function approximations for both expert data and reward-free\ninteractions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result\nthat can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and\ntherefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with\nsecond-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed\nhard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample\ncomplexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited\nexpert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in\nterms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\\epsilon$ and the policy\nvariance $\\sigma^2$.

Cellular subpopulations may shift from\ncycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental\nfates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,\nposing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which\nassume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE\n(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural\ngating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable\ncomponents, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and\naccurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because\nagents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is\nespecially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our\nmethod on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.\nFirst, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task\nusing synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample\nsettings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks\nwhich simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we\ndeploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it\ncan not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also\npredict when cells will commit
