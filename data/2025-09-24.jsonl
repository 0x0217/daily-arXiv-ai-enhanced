A critical challenge, however, lies in\nensuring agent generalizability - the ability to maintain consistent\nperformance across varied instructions, tasks, environments, and domains,\nespecially those beyond agents' fine-tuning data. Despite growing interest, the\nconcept of generalizability in LLM-based agents remains underdefined, and\nsystematic approaches to measure and improve it are lacking. In this survey, we\nprovide the first comprehensive review of generalizability in LLM-based agents.\nWe begin by emphasizing agent generalizability's importance by appealing to\nstakeholders and clarifying the boundaries of agent generalizability by\nsituating it within a hierarchical domain-task ontology. We then review\ndatasets, evaluation dimensions, and metrics, highlighting their limitations.\nNext, we categorize methods for improving generalizability into three groups:\nmethods for the backbone LLM, for agent components, and for their interactions.\nMoreover, we introduce the distinction between generalizable frameworks and\ngeneralizable agents and outline how generalizable frameworks can be translated\ninto agent-level generalizability. Finally, we identify critical challenges and\nfuture directions, including developing standardized frameworks, variance- and\ncost-based metrics, and approaches that integrate methodological innovations\nwith architecture-level designs.

While previous multitask learning\nstudies have focused on smooth regularization to enforce graph smoothness, this\nwork explores non-smooth regularization techniques that promote sparsity,\nmaking them particularly effective in encouraging piecewise constant\ntransitions on the graph.

Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are\nlimited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a\nprincipled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into\nstructured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval,\nfollowed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through\nprompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model\ninvocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling.

Our\nmethod reframes the human-AI interaction as a structured, Socratic dialogue,\ngoverned by an explicit and evolving rulebook, the Consciousness Transfer\nPackage (CTP). Through an interactive Gameplay Cycle that enforces ante-hoc\nstrategic justification and a state-locking Checksum that prevents error\naccumulation, the protocol transforms a powerful but opaque LRM into a\ndisciplined \"Clear Box\" agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method\nthrough an exhaustive 25-move case study in the complex strategic game \"Caps i\nCaps\". The agent not only solved the high-complexity puzzle but also\ndemonstrated Second-Order Agency, identifying flaws in its own\nsupervisor-approved plans and adapting its core integrity protocols mid-task.\nThe STAR-XAI Protocol offers a practical pathway to creating AI agents that are\nnot just high-performing, but also transparent, auditable, and trustworthy by\ndesign."}

Although agents seek distinct\nobjectives, collaboration among them can be beneficial in scenarios where\nrelationships between tasks exist. Among the various approaches to promoting\nrelationships between tasks and, consequently, enhancing collaboration between\nagents, one notable method is regularization. While previous multitask learning\nstudies have focused on smooth regularization to enforce graph smoothness, this\nwork explores non-smooth regularization techniques that promote sparsity,\nmaking them particularly effective in encouraging piecewise constant\ntransitions on the graph. We begin by formulating a global regularized\noptimization problem, which involves minimizing the aggregate sum of individual\ncosts, regularized by a general non-smooth term designed to promote\npiecewise-constant relationships between the tasks of neighboring agents. Based\non the forward-backward splitting strategy, we propose a decentralized learning\napproach that enables efficient solutions to the regularized optimization\nproblem. Then, under convexity assumptions on the cost functions and\nco-regularization, we establish that the proposed approach converges in the\nmean-square-error sense within $O(\\mu)$ of the optimal solution of the globally\nregularized cost. For broader applicability and improved computational\nefficiency, we also derive closed-form expressions for commonly used non-smooth\n(and, possibly, non-convex) regularizers, such as the weighted sum of the\n$\\ell_0$-norm, $\\ell_1$-norm, and elastic net regularization. Finally, we\nillustrate both the theoretical findings and the effectiveness of the approach\nthrough simulations."}

Evaluating SLRs with LLM-based Multi-Agent System", "comment": null, "summary": "Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are foundational to evidence-based\nresearch but remain labor-intensive and prone to inconsistency across\ndisciplines. We present an LLM-based SLR evaluation copilot built on a\nMulti-Agent System (MAS) architecture to assist researchers in assessing the\noverall quality of the systematic literature reviews. The system automates\nprotocol validation, methodological assessment, and topic relevance checks\nusing a scholarly database. Unlike conventional single-agent methods, our\ndesign integrates a specialized agentic approach aligned with PRISMA guidelines\nto support more structured and interpretable evaluations. We conducted an\ninitial study on five published SLRs from diverse domains, comparing system\noutputs to expert-annotated PRISMA scores, and observed 84% agreement. While\nearly results are promising, this work represents a first step toward scalable\nand accurate NLP-driven systems for interdisciplinary workflows and reveals\ntheir capacity for rigorous, domain-agnostic knowledge aggregation to\nstreamline the review process."}

Existing approaches\nface several limitations: model-based methods require a large number of\nparameters; data-driven methods rely heavily on labeled datasets; and current\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often lack aging adaptation, or still\ndepend on many parameters, or continuously regenerate states. In this work, we\npropose SeqBattNet, a discrete-state PINN with built-in aging adaptation for\nbattery modeling, to predict terminal voltage during the discharge process.\nSeqBattNet consists of two components: (i) an encoder, implemented as the\nproposed HRM-GRU deep learning module, which generates cycle-specific aging\nadaptation parameters; and (ii) a decoder, based on the equivalent circuit\nmodel (ECM) combined with deep learning, which uses these parameters together\nwith the input current to predict voltage. The model requires only three basic\nbattery parameters and, when trained on data from a single cell, still achieves\nrobust performance. Extensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets (TRI,\nRT-Batt, and NASA) demonstrate that SeqBattNet significantly outperforms\nclassical sequence models and PINN baselines, achieving consistently lower RMSE\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency."}

While input manipulation\nattacks (e.g., prompt injection) have been well studied, Bit-Flip Attacks\n(BFAs) -- which exploit hardware vulnerabilities to corrupt model parameters\nand cause severe performance degradation -- have received far less attention.\nExisting BFA methods suffer from key limitations: they fail to balance\nperformance degradation and output naturalness, making them prone to discovery.\nIn this paper, we introduce SilentStriker, the first stealthy bit-flip attack\nagainst LLMs that effectively degrades task performance while maintaining\noutput naturalness. Our core contribution lies in addressing the challenge of\ndesigning effective loss functions for LLMs with variable output length and the\nvast output space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on output perplexity for\nattack loss formulation, which inevitably degrade output naturalness, we\nreformulate the attack objective by leveraging key output tokens as targets for\nsuppression, enabling effective joint optimization of attack effectiveness and\nstealthiness. Additionally, we employ an iterative, progressive search strategy\nto maximize attack efficacy. Experiments show that SilentStriker significantly\noutperforms existing baselines, achieving successful attacks without\ncompromising the naturalness of generated text."}

Reinforcement\nlearning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic\nprogramming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial\noptimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth\nof the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy\nconcerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper\nproposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel\napproach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based\non a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to\ngroup possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent\nbehavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning\nlayer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents\nwith minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and\nreal-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and\ndrone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance,\nscalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective\nlearning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution."}

This alternative supervision is appealing\nbecause collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less\nlabor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the\ndevelopment of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this\ndomain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the\nwidely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly\napplied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the\ncomplementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance\nof CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup\n(ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate\nthe noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label\nsharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements\nacross synthetic and real-world labeled datasets. In particular, our wide\nspectrum of experimental results on both balanced and imbalanced CLL settings\njustifies the potential of ICM in allying with state-of-the-art CLL algorithms,\nachieving significant accuracy increases of 30% and 10% on MNIST and CIFAR\ndatasets, respectively."}

Leveraging an extended Stochastic\nDifferential Equation (SDE) framework, combined with an analysis of the\nstructure of stochastic gradient noise (SGN), we precisely characterize the\ndynamics of various SAM variants. Our findings reveal that the stochastic noise\nintroduced during SAM perturbations inherently induces a variance-based\nsharpness regularization effect.

Our improved lower bounds are obtained by\nconstructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using\nAlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper\nbounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error\nin the third decimal place.\n  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new\ninapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT\nand MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using\nAlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves\nupon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current\nbest gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of\nimproving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget\nreduction from \"standard\" H{\\aa}stad-style PCPs.\n  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction\nproduced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time).
