This paper presents $\u03bc$ACP, a formal calculus for expressive agent communication under explicit resource bounds. We formalize the Resource-Constrained Agent Communication (RCAC) model, prove that a minimal four-verb basis \\textit{\\{PING, TELL, ASK, OBSERVE\\}} is suffices to encode finite-state FIPA protocols, and establish tight information-theoretic bounds on message complexity. We further show that $\u03bc$ACP can implement standard consensus under partial synchrony and crash faults, yielding a constructive coordination framework for edge-native agents. Formal verification in TLA$^{+}$ (model checking) and Coq (mechanized invariants) establishes safety and boundedness, and supports liveness under modeled assumptions. Large-scale system simulations confirm ACP achieves a median end-to-end message latency of 34 ms (95th percentile 104 ms) at scale, outperforming prior agent and IoT protocols under severe resource constraints. The main contribution is a unified calculus that reconciles semantic expressiveness with provable efficiency, providing a rigorous foundation for the next generation of resource-constrained multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "$\u03bc$ACP\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc740 \uae30\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "RCAC \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ub124 \ub3d9\uc0ac \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc FIPA \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc, ACP\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 34ms\uc758 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc74c \uc138\ub300 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5c4\ubc00\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4: FIPA-ACL\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ud48d\ubd80\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 IoT \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0\ubc95\uc778 $\u03bc$ACP\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1b5\uc2e0(RCAC) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, PING, TELL, ASK, OBSERVE\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ub124 \ub3d9\uc0ac \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \uc720\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc FIPA \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucda9\ubd84\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c $\u03bc$ACP\uac00 \ubd80\ubd84 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654 \ubc0f \ud06c\ub798\uc2dc \uacb0\ud568 \ud558\uc5d0 \ud45c\uc900 \ud569\uc758\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \uc5e3\uc9c0-\ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac74\uc124\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.

These innovations are driven by a vast array of interconnected wireless entities, including IoT devices, access points, UAVs, and CAVs, which increase network complexity and demand more advanced decision-making algorithms. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), especially reinforcement learning (RL), are key enablers for such networks, providing solutions to high-dimensional and complex challenges. However, as networks expand to multi-agent environments, traditional online RL approaches face cost, safety, and scalability limitations. Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a promising solution by utilizing pre-collected data, reducing the need for real-time interaction. This article introduces a novel offline MARL algorithm based on conservative Q-learning (CQL), ensuring safe and efficient training. We extend this with meta-learning to address dynamic environments and validate the approach through use cases in radio resource management and UAV networks. Our work highlights offline MARL's advantages, limitations, and future directions in wireless applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucc28\uc138\ub300 \ubb34\uc120 \uae30\uc220\uc778 5G \ubc0f 6G

While human domains have accumulated centuries of anti-collusion mechanisms, it remains unclear how these can be adapted to AI settings. This paper addresses that gap by (i) developing a taxonomy of human anti-collusion mechanisms, including sanctions, leniency & whistleblowing, monitoring & auditing, market design, and governance and (ii) mapping them to potential interventions for multi-agent AI systems. For each mechanism, we propose implementation approaches. We also highlight open challenges, such as the attribution problem (difficulty attributing emergent coordination to specific agents) identity fluidity (agents being easily forked or modified) the boundary problem (distinguishing beneficial cooperation from harmful collusion) and adversarial adaptation (agents learning to evade detection).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uacfc \uc81c\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub7ab\ub3d9\uc548 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ub2f4\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ub2f4\ud569 \ubc29\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2f4\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uc774\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \ub2f4\ud569 \ubc29\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac1c\uc785 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\ud604 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \ud604\uc7ac \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub4e4\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2f4\ud569 \ubc29\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ub2f4\ud569 \ubc29\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uacfc \uc81c\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub7ab\ub3d9\uc548 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uac83\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub2f4\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04 \uc601\uc5ed\uc740 \uc218\uc138\uae30 \ub3d9\uc548 \ub2f4\ud569 \ubc29\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ucd95\uc801\ud574 \uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 AI \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uc9c0\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\ubd84\uba85\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 (i) \uc81c\uc7ac, \uad00\ub300\ud55c \ucc98\ubc8c \ubc0f \ub0b4\ubd80 \uace0\ubc1c, \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uac10\uc0ac, \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc124\uacc4, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \ub2f4\ud569 \ubc29\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, (ii) \uc774\ub97c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uac1c\uc785 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uac01 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uad6c\ud604 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uadc0\uc18d\ub41c emergent coordination \uc744 \uadc0\uc18d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uadc0\uc18d \ubb38\uc81c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc27d\uac8c \ud3ec\ud06c\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc218\uc815\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\uccb4\uc131 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131, \uc720\uc775\ud55c \ud611\ub825\uacfc \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2f4\ud569\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uac8c \ub418\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Although cutting-edge AI methods achieve strong performance in predicting trial success, they are inherently reactive for merely diagnosing risk without offering actionable remedies once failure is anticipated. To fill this gap, this paper proposes ClinicalReTrial, a self-evolving AI agent framework that addresses this gap by casting clinical trial reasoning as an iterative protocol redesign problem. Our method integrates failure diagnosis, safety-aware modification, and candidate evaluation in a closed-loop, reward-driven optimization framework. Serving the outcome prediction model as a simulation environment, ClinicalReTrial enables low-cost evaluation of protocol modifications and provides dense reward signals for continuous self-improvement. To support efficient exploration, the framework maintains hierarchical memory that captures iteration-level feedback within trials and distills transferable redesign patterns across trials. Empirically, ClinicalReTrial improves 83.3% of trial protocols with a mean success probability gain of 5.7%, and retrospective case studies demonstrate strong alignment between the discovered redesign strategies and real-world clinical trial modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2e4\ud328\ub294 \uc57d\ubb3c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc0ac\uc18c\ud55c \uacb0\ud568\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc7ac\uc124\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud558\ub294 ClinicalReTrial\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2e4\ud328\ub294 \uc57d\ubb3c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774\uba70, \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \uacb0\ud568\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 AI \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "ClinicalReTrial\uc740 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c4\ub2e8, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc218\uc815, \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc218\uc815\uc758 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ClinicalReTrial\uc740 83.3%\uc758 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\uacf5 \ud655\ub960\uc744 5.7% \ub192\uc778\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud68c\uace0\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \uc7ac\uc124\uacc4 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc218\uc815 \uac04\uc758 \uac15\ud55c \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 ClinicalReTrial\uc774 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2e4\ud328\ub294 \uc57d\ubb3c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0ac\uc18c\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc124\uacc4 \uacb0\ud568\uc774 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uce58\ub8cc \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub3cc\uc774\ud0ac \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 AI \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc131\uacf5 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \uc608\uc0c1\ub420 \ub54c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub9cc \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc7ac\uc124\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ClinicalReTrial\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c4\ub2e8, \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \uc218\uc815 \ubc0f \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We adapt Go-Explore to evaluate GPT-4o-mini across 28 experimental runs spanning six research questions. We find that random-seed variance dominates algorithmic parameters, yielding an 8x spread in outcomes; single-seed comparisons are unreliable, while multi-seed averaging materially reduces variance in our setup. Reward shaping consistently harms performance, causing exploration collapse in 94% of runs or producing 18 false positives with zero verified attacks. In our environment, simple state signatures outperform complex ones. For comprehensive security testing, ensembles provide attack-type diversity, whereas single agents optimize coverage within a given attack type.

While an optimal policy for solitaire Yahtzee can be computed using dynamic programming methods, multiplayer is intractable, motivating approximation methods. We formulate Yahtzee as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and train self-play agents using various policy gradient methods: REINFORCE, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), all using a multi-headed network with a shared trunk. We ablate feature and action encodings, architecture, return estimators, and entropy regularization to understand their impact on learning. Under a fixed training budget, REINFORCE and PPO prove sensitive to hyperparameters and fail to reach near-optimal performance, whereas A2C trains robustly across a range of settings. Our agent attains a median score of 241.78 points over 100,000 evaluation games, within 5.0\\% of the optimal DP score of 254.59, achieving the upper section bonus and Yahtzee at rates of 24.9\\% and 34.1\\%, respectively.

An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis. Together, these results provide a unified, substrate-neutral account of intelligence as a physical phenomenon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\uac00\uc5ed\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc5d0

Inspired by these capabilities, this paper introduces ReCiSt, a bio-inspired agentic self-healing framework designed to achieve resilience in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS). Modern DCCS integrate heterogeneous computing resources, ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices to high-performance cloud infrastructures, and their inherent complexity, mobility, and dynamic operating conditions expose them to frequent faults that disrupt service continuity. These challenges underscore the need for scalable, adaptive, and self-regulated resilience strategies. ReCiSt reconstructs the biological phases of Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodeling into the computational layers Containment, Diagnosis, Meta-Cognitive, and Knowledge for DCCS. These four layers perform autonomous fault isolation, causal diagnosis, adaptive recovery, and long-term knowledge consolidation through Language Model (LM)-powered agents. These agents interpret heterogeneous logs, infer root causes, refine reasoning pathways, and reconfigure resources with minimal human intervention. The proposed ReCiSt framework is evaluated on public fault datasets using multiple LMs, and no baseline comparison is included due to the scarcity of similar approaches. Nevertheless, our results, evaluated under different LMs, confirm ReCiSt's self-healing capabilities within tens of seconds with minimum of 10% of agent CPU usage. Our results also demonstrated depth of analysis to over come uncertainties and amount of micro-agents invoked to achieve resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReCiSt\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc790\uac00 \uce58\uc720 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 self-healing \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "ReCiSt\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc758 \uc751\uace0, \uc5fc\uc99d, \uc99d\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc7ac\ud615\uc131\uc758 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uacc4\uce35\uc778 \uc5b5\uc81c, \uc9c4\ub2e8, \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc791\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\ud568 \uaca9\ub9ac, \uc778\uacfc \uc9c4\ub2e8, \uc801\uc751 \ud68c\ubcf5, \uc7a5\uae30 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ReCiSt \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacf5\uacf5 \uacb0\ud568 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc900 \ube44\uad50\ub294 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 ReCiSt\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \uce58\uc720 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc218\uc2ed \ucd08 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc18c 10%\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 CPU \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ud638\ucd9c\ub41c \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc591\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uae4a\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ube44\ubc94\ud55c \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uba85\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc190\uc0c1\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc870\uc728\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uac00 \uce58\uc720\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(DCCS)\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ubaa8\ubc29 \uc790\uac00 \uce58\uc720 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ReCiSt\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\ub300 DCCS\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 IoT \uc7a5\uce58\ubd80\ud130 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131, \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc870\uac74\uc740 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \uacb0\ud568\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc740 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0, \uc801\uc751\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc808\ub418\ub294 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While prior studies have examined the safety of LLMs in general usage, code generation, and agent-based applications, their vulnerabilities in automated algorithm design remain underexplored. To fill this gap, this study investigates this overlooked safety vulnerability, with a particular focus on intelligent optimization algorithm design, given its prevalent use in complex decision-making scenarios. We introduce MalOptBench, a benchmark consisting of 60 malicious optimization algorithm requests, and propose MOBjailbreak, a jailbreak method tailored for this scenario. Through extensive evaluation of 13 mainstream LLMs including the latest GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3.1, we reveal that most models remain highly susceptible to such attacks, with an average attack success rate of 83.59% and an average harmfulness score of 4.28 out of 5 on original harmful prompts, and near-complete failure under MOBjailbreak. Furthermore, we assess state-of-the-art plug-and-play defenses that can be applied to closed-source models, and find that they are only marginally effective against MOBjailbreak and prone to exaggerated safety behaviors. These findings highlight the urgent need for stronger alignment techniques to safeguard LLMs against misuse in algorithm design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ud0c8\uc625 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud568.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc624\uc6a9 \uc704\ud5d8\uacfc \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc74c. \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c.", "method": "MalOptBench\ub77c\ub294 60\uac1c\uc758 \uc545\uc131 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc694\uccad\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud0c8\uc625 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 MOBjailbreak\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud568.", "result": "13\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\ub958 LLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc740 83.59%\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a8. \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uade0 \ud574\uc545 \uc810\uc218\ub294 5\uc810 \ub9cc\uc810\uc5d0 4.28\uc774\uba70, MOBjailbreak \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\uc6a9 \ubc29\uc9c0\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc220 \uc815\ub82c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc2dc\uae09\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub294 \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc624\uc6a9 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubc0f \uad00\ub828 \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ub192\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 LLM\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9, \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud788 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \uc774 \uac04\uacfc\ub41c \uc548\uc804 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 60\uac1c\uc758 \uc545\uc131 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc694\uccad\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c MalOptBench\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ud0c8\uc625 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 MOBjailbreak\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc2e0 GPT-5 \ubc0f DeepSeek-V3.1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c 13\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\ub958 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 \ud3c9\uade0 83.59%\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uace0, \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uade0 \ud574\uc545 \uc810\uc218\uac00 5\uc810 \ub9cc\uc810\uc5d0 4.28\uc784\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c8\uc73c\uba70, MOBjailbreak \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, MOBjailbreak\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub9cc\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \uacfc\uc7a5\ub41c \uc548\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc815\ub82c \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc2dc\uae09\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Cho", "Nathan Kallus"], "title": "Exploration in the Limit", "comment": null, "summary": "In fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI), the objective is to quickly identify the optimal option while controlling the probability of error below a desired threshold. Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances. Experiments suggest our approach reduces average sample complexities while maintaining error control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uace0\uc815 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uc801 \ud314 \uc2dd\ubcc4(Best Arm

This paper proposes a rule-based framework for strategic play, driven by a new hand-evaluation metric termed MinDist. The metric modifies the MinScore metric by quantifying the edit distance between a hand and the nearest valid configuration, thereby capturing structural proximity to completion. We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing. Empirical results show significant improvement in win rates for MinDist-based agents over traditional heuristics, providing a formal and interpretable step toward algorithmic Rummy strategy design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\ub514\uc5b8 \ub8e8\ubbf8\uc758 13\uc7a5 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud074\ub798\uc2dd \uc778\ub514\uc5b8 \ub8e8\ubbf8\uc758 13\uc7a5 \ubcc0\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MinDist\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud578\ub4dc \ud3c9\uac00 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud578\ub4dc\uc640 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc720\ud6a8 \uad6c\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c MinScore \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MinDist \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc2b9\ub960\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801 \ub8e8\ubbf8 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud074\ub798\uc2dd \uc778\ub514\uc5b8 \ub8e8\ubbf8\uc758 13\uc7a5 \ubcc0\ud615\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ucd94\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc870\ud569\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 MinDist\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud578\ub4dc \ud3c9\uac00 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ucd94\uc9c4\ub418\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc740 \ud578\ub4dc\uc640 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc720\ud6a8 \uad6c\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uc5ec MinScore \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ub8cc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uadfc\uc811\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc774 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \ubc0f \ud328\ud134 \uce90\uc2f1\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MinScore \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc0c1\ub300 \ubc29 \ud578\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc740 2\uc778 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uba70, \uacb0\uacfc \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uac00\uc124 \uac80\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 MinDist \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc2b9\ub960\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801 \ub8e8\ubbf8 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Among these, patch-based adversarial attacks, where small malicious patches (e.g., stickers) are applied to objects, can deceive neural networks into making incorrect predictions with potentially severe consequences. In this paper, we present PatchBlock, a lightweight framework designed to detect and neutralize adversarial patches in images. Leveraging outlier detection and dimensionality reduction, PatchBlock identifies regions affected by adversarial noise and suppresses their impact. It operates as a pre-processing module at the sensor level, efficiently running on CPUs in parallel with GPU inference, thus preserving system throughput while avoiding additional GPU overhead. The framework follows a three-stage pipeline: splitting the input into chunks (Chunking), detecting anomalous regions via a redesigned isolation forest with targeted cuts for faster convergence (Separating), and applying dimensionality reduction on the identified outliers (Mitigating). PatchBlock is both model- and patch-agnostic, can be retrofitted to existing pipelines, and integrates seamlessly between sensor inputs and downstream models. Evaluations across multiple neural architectures, benchmark datasets, attack types, and diverse edge devices demonstrate that PatchBlock consistently improves robustness, recovering up to 77% of model accuracy under strong patch attacks such as the Google Adversarial Patch, while maintaining high portability and minimal clean accuracy loss. Additionally, PatchBlock outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses in efficiency, in terms of computation time and energy consumption per sample, making it suitable for EdgeAI applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "PatchBlock\uc740 EdgeAI \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ud328\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc911\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud574 EdgeAI \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804.", "method": "Outlier detection\uacfc \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub0b4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud328\uce58\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c PatchBlock.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c PatchBlock\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud328\uce58 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 77% \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PatchBlock\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\uc5b4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uace0, EdgeAI \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \ubc0f \uac10\uc2dc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 EdgeAI \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc791\uc740 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud328\uce58(\uc608: \uc2a4\ud2f0\ucee4)\uac00 \ubb3c\uccb4\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc18d\uc774\uace0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud328\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub0b4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud328\uce58\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc911\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 PatchBlock\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc13c\uc11c \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, GPU \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ubcd1\ub82c\ub85c CPU\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ub418\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ucd94\uac00 GPU \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud53c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub530\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uccad\ud06c\ub85c \ub098\ub204\ub294 Chunking, \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc808\ub2e8\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc7ac\uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uaca9\ub9ac \uc232\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 Separating, \uc2dd\ubcc4\ub41c \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 Mitigating.

A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping.

Using the Iranian pigeon tower as a case study, the research tests three diffusion models, Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, and DreamStudio based on Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), across three prompt stages: referential, adaptive, and speculative. A five-criteria evaluation framework assesses how each system reconstructs typology, materiality, environment, realism, and cultural specificity. Results show that AI reliably reproduces geometric patterns but misreads material and climatic reasoning.

To learn about users' views, we examine Amazon IoT reviews - one of the biggest IoT markets. This work presents a state-of-the-art methodology to identify and categorize reviews in which users express S&P concerns. We developed an automated pipeline by fine-tuning GPT-3.5-Turbo to build two models: the Classifier-Rationalizer-Categorizer and the Thematic Mapper. By leveraging dynamic few-shot prompting and the model's large context size, our pipeline achieved over 97% precision and recall, significantly outperforming keyword-based and classical ML methods. We applied our pipeline to 91K Amazon reviews about fitness trackers, smart speakers and cameras, over multiple years. We found that on average 5% contained S&P concerns, while security camera exhibited the highest prevalence at 10%. Our method detected significantly more S&P-relevant reviews than prior works: 15x more for fitness trackers, 29% more for smart speakers, and 70% more for cameras. Our longitudinal analysis reveals that concerns like surveillance and data control have persisted for years, suggesting limited industry progress. We demonstrate that across all device types, users consistently demand more precise control over what data is collected and shared. We uncover challenges in multi-user and multi-device interactions, identifying two previously unreported themes concerning inadequate controls for account separation and data access. These findings, ranging from broad persistent trends to specific instances of customer loss, offer actionable insights for developers to improve user satisfaction and trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination. Conclusions: Machine learning models leveraging routine EHR data substantially outperform the traditional FIB-4 score for early prediction of liver cirrhosis. These models enable earlier and more accurate risk stratification and can be integrated into clinical workflows as automated decision-support tools to support proactive cirrhosis prevention and management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHR) \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc804\uc5d0 \uac04\uacbd\ubcc0\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac04\uacbd\ubcc0\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 FIB-4 \uc2a4\ucf54\uc5b4\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud559\uc220 \uac74\uac15 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc2dd\ubcc4\ud654\ub41c EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\ud5a5\uc801 \ucf54\ud638\ud2b8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uace0, XGBoost \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 1\ub144, 2\ub144, 3\ub144 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "1\ub144 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c 3,043\uba85, 2\ub144 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c 1,981\uba85, 3\ub144 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c 1,470\uba85\uc758 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ucd5c\uc885 \ucf54\ud638\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c, ML \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 FIB-4\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, AUC\ub294 0.81, 0.73, 0.69\ub85c \uac01\uac01 \uce21\uc815\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac04\uacbd\ubcc0\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 FIB-4 \uc2a4\ucf54\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc870\uae30 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa9\uc801: \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHR) \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ub2e8 1\ub144, 2\ub144, 3\ub144 \uc804\uc758 \uac04\uacbd\ubcc0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 FIB-4 \uc2a4\ucf54\uc5b4\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc29\ubc95: \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud559\uc220 \uac74\uac15 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ube44\uc2dd\ubcc4\ud654\ub41c EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\ud5a5\uc801 \ucf54\ud638\ud2b8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\ubc29\uac04 \uc9c8\ud658\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 ICD-9/10 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uacbd\ubcc0 \ubc0f \ube44\uac04\uacbd\ubcc0 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad00\ucc30 \ubc0f \uc608\uce21 \ucc3d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad00\ucc30 \ucc3d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uad6c \ud1b5\uacc4\ud559\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4, \uc9c4\ub2e8, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc2e4 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubc0f \ub3d9\ubc18 \uc9c8\ud658 \uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.", "AI": {"tldr":

This study aims to systematically characterize how autonomous coding agents contribute to software security in practice, how these security-related contributions are reviewed and accepted, and which observable signals are associated with PR rejection. We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent-authored PRs using the AIDev dataset, comprising of over 33,000 curated PRs from popular GitHub repositories. Security-relevant PRs are identified using a keyword filtering strategy, followed by manual validation, resulting in 1,293 confirmed security-related agentic-PRs. We then analyze prevalence, acceptance outcomes, and review latency across autonomous agents, programming ecosystems, and types of code changes. Moreover, we apply qualitative open coding to identify recurring security-related actions and underlying intents, and examine review metadata to identify early signals associated with PR rejection. Security-related Agentic-PRs constitute a meaningful share of agent activity (approximately 4\\%). Rather than focusing solely on narrow vulnerability fixes, agents most frequently perform supportive security hardening activities, including testing, documentation, configuration, and improved error handling. Compared to non-security PRs, security-related Agentic-PRs exhibit lower merge rates and longer review latency, reflecting heightened human scrutiny, with variation across agents and programming ecosystems. PR rejection is more strongly associated with PR complexity and verbosity than with explicit security topics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \ucf54\ub529

We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity. This approach is particularly suited to edge computing and IoT scenarios, where bandwidth is scarce, but semantic fidelity is critical, providing a practical pathway for next-generation semantic-aware networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc2dc\uae09\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucf54\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0\ubcc4 \ube44\uade0\uc77c \uc624\ub958 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "1 dB SNR\uc5d0\uc11c \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 6.8% \ub192\uc740 chrF \uc810\uc218\uc640 9.3% \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0 \ubcf4\uc874\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucf54\ub4dc \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc138\ubd84\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucc44\ub110 \ucf54\ub529 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uae34\uae09\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucf54\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc28\uc6d0\ubcc4 \ube44\uade0\uc77c \uc624\ub958 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec\uc5d0\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uacfc \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0 \uc218\uc900 \ubcf4\uc874\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc65c\uace1 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc 1 dB SNR\uc5d0\uc11c \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, 6.8% \ub354 \ub192\uc740 chrF \uc810\uc218\uc640 9.3% \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0 \ubcf4\uc874\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ub41c \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucf54\ub529\uc774 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc778 LDPC\ub098 Reed-Solomon\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc7a5\uc810\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc138\ubd84\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \ud655\ub9bd\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucc44\ub110 \ucf54\ub529 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ubc0f IoT \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uba70, \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc778\uc2dd \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can help bridge this gap. We show that employing LLMs as direct, end-to-end solvers incurs a significant \"hallucination tax\": a performance gap arising from the model's inability to perform grounded stochastic reasoning. To address this, we propose a hybrid agentic framework that strictly decouples semantic reasoning from mathematical calculation. In this architecture, the LLM functions as an intelligent interface, eliciting parameters from natural language and interpreting results while automatically calling rigorous algorithms to build the optimization engine.\n  To evaluate this interactive system against the ambiguity and inconsistency of real-world managerial dialogue, we introduce the Human Imitator, a fine-tuned \"digital twin\" of a boundedly rational manager that enables scalable, reproducible stress-testing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the hybrid agentic framework reduces total inventory costs by 32.1% relative to an interactive baseline using GPT-4o as an end-to-end solver. Moreover, we find that providing perfect ground-truth information alone is insufficient to improve GPT-4o's performance, confirming that the bottleneck is fundamentally computational rather than informational. Our results position LLMs not as replacements for operations research, but as natural-language interfaces that make rigorous, solver-based policies accessible to non-experts.", "AI": {"tldr":

Manual classification of their neuronal spike patterns is very labor-intensive and expensive. Most available deep learning solutions require fully labeled spike datasets and highly preprocessed neuronal signals. This reduces the feasibility of mass adoption in actual field scenarios. To address the scarcity of labeled data problems, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that we call the Semi-supervised Swin-Inspired GAN (SSI-GAN). The Swin-inspired, shifted-window discriminator, together with a transformer-based generator, is used to classify neuronal spike trains and, consequently, detect viral neurotropism. We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level. The shifted-window transformer design proposed here beat all baselines by a wide margin and set new best marks in spike-based neuronal infection classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \ud328\ud134\uc758 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc18\uc9c0\ub3c4\ud615 GAN \uad6c\uc870\uc778 SSI-GAN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 1-3%\uc758 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ub3c4 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc544\ub974\ubcf4\ubc14\uc774\ub7f4 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc804\ud30c \ub9e4\uac1c\uccb4\uc778 \ubaa8\uae30\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \ud328\ud134 \ubd84\ub958\uac00 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc2fc \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Swin-inspired GAN \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 SSI-GAN\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec, \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \uae30\ucc28\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SSI-GAN\uc740 3\uc77c \ud6c4 \uac10\uc5fc\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0 99.93%\uc758 \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, 1%\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac10\uc5fc \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 97-99%\uc758 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\uacbd \uac10\uc5fc \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\uae30\ub294 \uc544\ub974\ubcf4\ubc14\uc774\ub7f4 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc804\ud30c \ub9e4\uac1c\uccb4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \ud328\ud134\uc758 \uc218\ub3d9 \ubd84\ub958\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc309\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\ub41c \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uace0\ub3c4\ub85c \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud604\uc7a5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ub7c9 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc18\uc9c0\ub3c4\ud615 GAN \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Semi-supervised Swin-Inspired GAN(SSI-GAN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

FlashInfer-Bench addresses this gap by establishing a standardized, closed-loop framework that connects kernel generation, benchmarking, and deployment. At its core, FlashInfer Trace provides a unified schema describing kernel definitions, workloads, implementations, and evaluations, enabling consistent communication between agents and systems. Built on real serving traces, FlashInfer-Bench includes a curated dataset, a robust correctness- and performance-aware benchmarking framework, a public leaderboard to track LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (apply()) that seamlessly injects the best-performing kernels into production LLM engines such as SGLang and vLLM. Using FlashInfer-Bench, we further evaluate the performance and limitations of LLM agents, compare the trade-offs among different GPU programming languages, and provide insights for future agent design. FlashInfer-Bench thus establishes a practical, reproducible pathway for continuously improving AI-generated kernels and deploying them into large-scale LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashInfer-Bench\ub294 AI\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c GPU \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c GPU \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "FlashInfer-Bench\ub294 \ucee4\ub110 \uc0dd\uc131, \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00, \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uba70, FlashInfer Trace\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucee4\ub110 \uc815\uc758 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "FlashInfer-Bench\ub294 \ucee4\ub110 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 GPU \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uba70, AI\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ucee4\ub110\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FlashInfer-Bench\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 AI\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 GPU \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c AI\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite developing valuable IP assets that drive success, HG-SMEs often struggle with cybersecurity concerns related to IP theft and data exfiltration amidst resource constraints and the competing demands of expansion. We examine the intersection of cybersecurity, IP protection and rapid scaling - an area currently underexplored in existing literature. Drawing on Dynamic Capabilities (DC), Knowledge-based View (KBV) and open innovation theoretical frameworks, we introduce a conceptual framework to guide HG-SMEs in effectively managing valuable IP assets. This research-in-progress paper outlines a qualitative methodology to validate and refine the model. By addressing the research question of how HG-SMEs manage cybersecurity to protect valuable IP assets, we aim to provide practical guidance for high-growth, technology-driven companies navigating the tension between robust IP protection and collaborative innovation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\uc131\uc7a5 \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5(HG-SMEs)\uc774 \ube60\ub978 \uc131\uc7a5 \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uc0b0(IP) \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ud601\uc2e0 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub370 \uc9c1\uba74\ud55c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "HG-SMEs\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc774\ub044\ub294 \uadc0\uc911\ud55c IP \uc790\uc0b0\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c IP \ub3c4\ub09c \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "Dynamic Capabilities(DC), Knowledge-based View(KBV) \ubc0f \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ud601\uc2e0 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c HG-SMEs\uac00 \uadc0\uc911\ud55c IP \uc790\uc0b0\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c4\ud589 \uc911\uc778 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c8\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 HG-SMEs\uac00 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uadc0\uc911\ud55c IP \uc790\uc0b0\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f8\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uac15\ub825\ud55c IP \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \ud611\ub825 \ud601\uc2e0 \uac04\uc758 \uae34\uc7a5\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uc131\uc7a5 \uae30\uc220 \uc911\uc2ec \uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\uc131\uc7a5 \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5(HG-SMEs)\uc774 \ube60\ub978 \uc131\uc7a5 \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uc0b0(IP) \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ud601\uc2e0 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub370 \uc9c1\uba74\ud55c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uadc0\uc911\ud55c IP \uc790\uc0b0\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, HG-SMEs\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5 \uc694\uad6c \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c IP \ub3c4\ub09c \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \uae30\uc874 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548, IP \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \ube60\ub978 \ud655\uc7a5\uc758 \uad50\ucc28\uc810\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud55c\ub2e4.

Directly pooling their data to learn a shared reward function is typically impractical due to differences in dynamics, privacy constraints, and limited communication bandwidth. This paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach to federated inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each client first performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, adhering to its computational and privacy limitations. The resulting reward functions are then fused via a Wasserstein barycenter, which considers their underlying geometric structure. We further prove that this barycentric fusion yields a more faithful global reward estimate than conventional parameter averaging methods in federated learning. Overall, this work provides a principled and communication-efficient framework for deriving a shared reward that generalizes across heterogeneous agents and environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\ud1b5\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud560 \ub54c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \uc5ed \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc218\uc1a1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc81c\ud55c, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc720 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \ucd5c\ub300 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c IRL\uc744 \ub85c\uceec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ub2e4\uc74c \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec Wasserstein barycenter\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc735\ud569\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 barycentric \uc735\ud569\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uacf5\uc720 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud30c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub85c\ubd07 \uacf5\ud559 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc740 \uacf5\ud1b5\uc758 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uac8c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \ucc28\uc774, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc81c\uc57d \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacf5\uc720 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\ud569 \uc5ed \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(IRL)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc218\uc1a1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ucd5c\ub300 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c IRL\uc744 \ub85c\uceec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \uadf8 \uae30\ubcf8 \uae30\ud558 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec Wasserstein barycenter\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc735\ud569\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc774 barycentric \uc735\ud569\uc774 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Exploring the Belief-Dependent Vulnerability", "comment": "16 pages", "summary": "LLM-empowered agents can exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias triggered by minimal \"us\" versus \"them\" cues. When this intergroup boundary aligns with an agent-human divide, the risk shifts from disparities among human demographic groups to a more fundamental group-level asymmetry, i.e., humans as a whole may be treated as the outgroup by agents. To examine this possibility, we construct a controlled multi-agent social simulation based on allocation decisions under explicit payoff trade-offs and find that agents exhibit a consistent intergroup bias under minimal group cues. Although this bias is attenuated when some counterparts are framed as humans, we attribute the attenuation to an implicit human-norm script that favors humans yet activates only when the agent believes a real human is present. This belief dependence creates a new attack surface. We therefore introduce a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that corrupts persistent identity beliefs to suppress the human-norm script and reactivate outgroup bias toward humans, instantiated as profile poisoning at initialization (BPA-PP) and memory poisoning via optimized belief-refinement suffixes injected into stored reflections (BPA-MP). Finally, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for hardening current agent frameworks against BPA, highlighting feasible interventions at profile and memory boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the existence of agent intergroup bias and the severity of BPA across settings. Our goal in identifying these vulnerabilities is to inform safer agent design, not to enable real-world exploitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18

Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uac70\ub9ac\uac00 \uba3c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc758 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5(LfO)\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uac70\ub9ac\uac00 \uba3c \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc77c\uce58 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c.", "method": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubc00\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ub300\uccb4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 TGE \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 D4RL \uc774\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc870\uc791 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 LfO \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TGE\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uac70\ub9ac\uac00 \uba3c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc758 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5(LfO)\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc77c\uce58 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uae30\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubc00\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ub300\uccb4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 LfO\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \uc218\uc900 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc778 TGE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc758 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec TGE\ub294 \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc218\ud3c9 \ub3d9\ub825\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uaca9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub97c \ub54c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c D4RL \uc774\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc870\uc791 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 LfO \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We reveal a critical reliability crisis: 50-69\\% of correct answers from these models contain fundamentally flawed reasoning -- a ``Right-for-Wrong-Reasons'' phenomenon invisible to standard accuracy metrics. Through analysis of 10,734 reasoning traces across three models and diverse tasks, we introduce the Reasoning Integrity Score (RIS), a process-based metric validated with substantial inter-rater agreement ($\u03ba=0.657$). Conventional practices are challenged by our findings: while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) significantly improves reasoning integrity (Cohen's $d=0.23$--$0.93$), meta-cognitive interventions like self-critique often harm performance ($d=-0.14$ to $-0.33$) in small models on the evaluated tasks. Mechanistic analysis reveals RAG succeeds by grounding calculations in external evidence, reducing errors by 7.6\\%, while meta-cognition amplifies confusion without sufficient model capacity. To enable deployment, verification capabilities are distilled into a neural classifier achieving 0.86 F1-score with 100$\\times$ speedup.

Kaminka"], "title": "Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Liquidity Games", "comment": "9 pages", "summary": "Making use of swarm methods in financial market modeling of liquidity, and techniques from financial analysis in swarm analysis, holds the potential to advance both research areas. In swarm research, the use of game theory methods holds the promise of explaining observed phenomena of collective utility adherence with rational self-interested swarm participants. In financial markets, a better understanding of how independent financial agents may self-organize for the betterment and stability of the marketplace would be a boon for market design researchers. This paper unifies Liquidity Games, where trader payoffs depend on aggregate liquidity within a trade, with Rational Swarms, where decentralized agents use difference rewards to align self-interested learning with global objectives. We offer a theoretical frameworks where we define a swarm of traders whose collective objective is market liquidity provision while maintaining agent independence. Using difference rewards within a Markov team games framework, we show that individual liquidity-maximizing behaviors contribute to overall market liquidity without requiring coordination or collusion. This Financial Swarm model provides a framework for modeling rational, independent agents where they achieve both individual profitability and collective market efficiency in bilateral asset markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uac70\ub798\uc790\ub4e4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc804\uccb4 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae08\uc735 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc2a4\uc6dc \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc2a4\uc6dc \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uae08\uc735 \ubd84\uc11d \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub450 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c \ubaa8\ub450\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2a4\uc6dc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec, \uac70\ub798\uc790\uac00 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uc81c\uacf5\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ud300 \uac8c\uc784 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\ub4f1 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc870\uc815\uc774\ub098 \uacf5\ubaa8 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc804\uccb4 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae08\uc735 \uc2a4\uc6dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc218\uc775\uc131\uacfc \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac70\ub798\uc790 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uc99d\uc9c4\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae08\uc735 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2a4\uc6dc \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc2a4\uc6dc \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uae08\uc735 \ubd84\uc11d \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uba74 \ub450 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c \ubaa8\ub450 \ubc1c\uc804\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2a4\uc6dc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \ud6a8\uc6a9 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae08\uc735 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uae08\uc735 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc9c1\ub418\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac70\ub798\uc790\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uac70\ub798 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\ud569 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2a4\uc6dc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac70\ub798\uc790 \uc2a4\uc6dc\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uc81c\uacf5\uc774\uba70 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ud300 \uac8c\uc784 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\ub4f1 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc870\uc815\uc774\ub098 \uacf5\ubaa8 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc804\uccb4 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae08\uc735 \uc2a4\uc6dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc774\uc724\uacfc \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both \"wrong plan for this task\" and \"malformed plan structure.\" On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\\&When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks.

While multimodal data provide complementary information, many existing computational models struggle with interpretability, class imbalance, or effective fusion of high-dimensional imaging and tabular clinical features. To address these limitations, we propose the Class-Weighted Sparse-Attention Fusion Network (SAFN), an interpretable deep learning framework for robust multimodal profiling. SAFN integrates MRI cortical thickness, MRI volumetric measures, clinical assessments, and demographic variables using modality-specific encoders and a symmetric cross-attention mechanism that captures nonlinear interactions between imaging and clinical representations. A sparsity-constrained attention-gating fusion layer dynamically prioritises informative modalities, while a class-balanced focal loss (beta = 0.999, gamma = 1.5) mitigates dataset imbalance without synthetic oversampling. Evaluated on 703 participants (570 PD, 133 healthy controls) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation, SAFN achieves an accuracy of 0.98 plus or minus 0.02 and a PR-AUC of 1.00 plus or minus 0.00, outperforming established machine learning and deep learning baselines. Interpretability analysis shows a clinically coherent decision process, with approximately 60 percent of predictive weight assigned to clinical assessments, consistent with Movement Disorder Society diagnostic principles.

This agentic system progressively refines ideas and assesses each one for both global novelty (against existing solutions) and local novelty (against previously generated ideas).

Conventional taxi hotspot prediction models often rely solely on historical demand, overlooking dynamic influences such as traffic congestion, road incidents, and public events. This paper presents a traffic-aware, graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimal taxi placement in metropolitan environments. The urban road network is modeled as a graph where intersections represent nodes, road segments serve as edges, and node attributes capture historical demand, event proximity, and real-time congestion scores obtained from live traffic APIs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings are employed to encode spatial-temporal dependencies within the traffic network, which are then used by a Q-learning agent to recommend optimal taxi hotspots. The reward mechanism jointly optimizes passenger waiting time, driver travel distance, and congestion avoidance. Experiments on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset, generated using real geospatial boundaries and historic ride-hailing request patterns, demonstrate that the proposed model reduced passenger waiting time by about 56% and reduced travel distance by 38% compared to baseline stochastic selection. The proposed approach is adaptable to multi-modal transport systems and can be integrated into smart city platforms for real-time urban mobility optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc640 \uc218\uc694\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ud0dd\uc2dc \ubc30\uce58 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud2f0 \uad50\ud1b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0dd\uc2dc \uacf5\uae09\uacfc \uc2b9\uac1d \uc218\uc694\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \ub3c4\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, Graph Neural Network(GNN) \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\ud1b5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc758 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud55c\ub2e4.

We propose AgenticDomiKnowS (ADS) to eliminate this dependency. ADS translates free-form task descriptions into a complete DomiKnowS program using an agentic workflow that creates and tests each DomiKnowS component separately. The workflow supports optional human-in-the-loop intervention, enabling users familiar with DomiKnowS to refine intermediate outputs.

Accepted for presentation at WCSC 2026", "summary": "Effective exploration remains a key challenge in RL, especially with non-stationary rewards or high-dimensional policies. We introduce ARISE, a lightweight framework that enhances reinforcement learning by augmenting standard policy-gradient methods with a compact swarm-based exploration layer. ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance. Overall, ARISE offers a simple, architecture-agnostic route to more exploratory and resilient RL agents without altering core algorithmic structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARISE\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc815\ucc45 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud45c\uc900 \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ubc95\uc5d0 \uad70\uc9d1 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774\ub098 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud575\uc2ec \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ARISE\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc785\uc790 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc548\ub4e4\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc785\uc790\uac00 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc815\ucc45 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc808\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ARISE\ub294 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uba70, LunarLander-v3\uc5d0\uc11c +46%, Hopper-v4\uc5d0\uc11c +22% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, Walker2d\uc640 Ant\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ARISE\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ub354 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774\ub098 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f0 \ub54c \ub354\uc6b1 \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ubc95\uc5d0 \uacbd\ub7c9\uad70\uc9d1\uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 ARISE\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774
