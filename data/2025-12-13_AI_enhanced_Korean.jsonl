Deterministic workflow automation cannot meet these requirements, as it lacks the epistemic flexibility, cooperative coordination mechanisms, and norm-sensitive behaviour required for institutional risk-transfer.\n  We propose the Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP), a formal model that extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by adding three missing elements: (i) simulator-coupled transition dynamics grounded in catastrophe, capital, and portfolio engines; (ii) role-specialized agents with structured observability, belief updates, and typed communication; and (iii) a normative feasibility layer encoding solvency, regulatory, and organizational rules as admissibility constraints on joint actions.\n  Using LLM-based agents with tool access and typed message protocols, we show in a domain-calibrated synthetic environment that governed multi-agent coordination yields more stable, coherent, and norm-adherent behaviour than deterministic automation or monolithic LLM baselines--reducing pricing variance, improving capital efficiency, and increasing clause-interpretation accuracy. Embedding prudential norms as admissibility constraints and structuring communication into typed acts measurably enhances equilibrium stability.\n  Overall, the results suggest that regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are most naturally modelled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc7ac\ubcf4\ud5d8

Our agents maintain internal memory states while depositing persistent environmental traces, creating a spatially distributed collective memory without centralized control. Comprehensive validation across five environmental conditions (20x20 to 50x50 grids, 5-20 agents, 50 runs per configuration) reveals a critical asymmetry: individual memory alone provides 68.7% performance improvement over no-memory baselines (1563.87 vs 927.23, p < 0.001), while environmental traces without memory fail completely. This demonstrates that memory functions independently but traces require cognitive infrastructure for interpretation. Systematic density-sweep experiments (rho in [0.049, 0.300], up to 625 agents) validate our theoretical phase transition prediction. On realistic large grids (30x30, 50x50), stigmergic coordination dominates above rho ~ 0.20, with traces outperforming memory by 36-41% on composite metrics despite lower food efficiency.

Unlike approaches that require agents to stop and deliberate, our system enables LLM-based route planning while agents are moving, significantly reducing intersection wait times. Under high traffic, agents average just 0.75 seconds of decision latency. To coordinate many agents in real-time, we implement a non-blocking asynchronous architecture using Unity coroutines and a dedicated request manager. The environment is a weighted undirected graph with live congestion metrics, updated continuously by the agents to enable shared perception. Our results show LLM-driven agents can dynamically adapt to traffic, reroute around congestion, and exhibit behaviors beyond static pathfinding, all while maintaining real-time performance.

By leveraging the computational advantages of quantum devices, QFL offers significant improvements in learning efficiency and resilience against quantum-era threats. However, future 6G environments are expected to be highly dynamic, decentralized, and data-intensive, which necessitates moving beyond traditional centralized federated learning frameworks. To meet this demand, blockchain technology provides a decentralized, tamper-resistant infrastructure capable of enabling trustless collaboration among distributed quantum edge devices. This paper presents QFLchain, a novel framework that integrates QFL with blockchain to support scalable and secure 6G intelligence. In this work, we investigate four key pillars of \\textit{QFLchain} in the 6G context: (i) communication and consensus overhead, (ii) scalability and storage overhead, (iii) energy inefficiency, and (iv) security vulnerability. A case study is also presented, demonstrating potential advantages of QFLchain, based on simulation, over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of training performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc591\uc790 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(QFL)\uacfc \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c QFLchain \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucc28\uc138\ub300 6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uba70 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 QFL\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "QFL\uacfc \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c QFLchain \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, 6G \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \ud569\uc758 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc800\uc7a5 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "QFLchain\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "QFLchain\uc740 6G \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc804\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc591\uc790 \uc2dc\ub300\uc758 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc591\uc790 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(QFL)\uc740 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uba70 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc591\uc790 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 QFL\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc591\uc790 \uc2dc\ub300 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 6G \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc77c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\uc5b4 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc218\uc694\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc591\uc790 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58 \uac04\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \ubc0f \ubcc0\uc870 \uc800\ud56d \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 QFL\uacfc \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c 6G \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc804\uc2a4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 QFLchain\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 6G \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c QFLchain\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc18c\uc778 (i) \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \ud569\uc758 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc, (ii) \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc800\uc7a5 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc, (iii) \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728, (iv) \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucca8\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c QFLchain\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the \"curse of dimensionality,\" rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV. Trained on 2023-24 and evaluated on 2024-25 Eredivisie event and tracking data, DEFCON's aggregated player credits exhibit strong positive correlations with market valuations. Finally, we showcase several practical applications, including in-game timelines of defensive contributions, spatial analyses across pitch zones, and pairwise summaries of attacker-defender interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "DEFCON\uc740 \ucd95\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc120\uc218\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd95\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b0\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacf5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\ub9cc \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucdc4\ub2e4.", "method": "DEFCON\uc740 Graph Attention Networks\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9 \uc635\uc158\uc758 \uc131\uacf5 \ud655\ub960\uacfc \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\uc758 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DEFCON\uc758 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub41c \uc120\uc218 \ud06c\ub808\ub527\uc740 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uac15\ud55c \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DEFCON\uc740 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud0c0\uc784\ub77c\uc778, \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\uc11d, \uacf5\uaca9\uc790-\ubc29\uc5b4\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc694\uc57d\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd95\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \uac00\ub054 \uac00\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uacf5-\ud589\ub3d9(\uac00\ub839 \uc778\ud130\uc149\ud2b8\uc640 \ud0dc\ud074)\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0 \uc608\ubc29\ud558\ub294 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uacf5-\ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc911\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DEFCON(DEFensive CONtribution evaluator)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ucd95\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc120\uc218 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.

Cybercriminals are exploiting this trend, deploying malicious Chrome extensions posing as AI tools or impersonating popular GenAI models to target users. These extensions often appear legitimate while secretly exfiltrating sensitive data or redirecting users web traffic to attacker-controlled domains.\n  To examine the impact of this trend on the browser extension ecosystem, we curated a dataset of 5,551 AI-themed extensions released over a nine-month period to the Chrome Web Store. Using a multi-signal detection methodology that combines manifest analysis, domain reputation, and runtime network behavior, supplemented with human review, we identified 154 previously undetected malicious Chrome extensions. Together with extensions known from public threat research disclosures, this resulted in a final set of 341 malicious extensions for analysis. Of these, 29 were GenAI-related, forming the focus of our in-depth analysis and disclosure.\n  We deconstruct representative GenAI cases, including Supersonic AI, DeepSeek AI | Free AI Assistant, and Perplexity Search, to illustrate attacker techniques such as Adversary-in-the-Browser, impersonation, bait-and-switch updates, query hijacking, and redirection. Our findings show that threat actors are leveraging GenAI trends and exploiting browser extension APIs and settings for malicious purposes. This demonstrates that the browser extension threat landscape is directly evolving alongside the rapid adoption of GenAI technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84

Effective verification requires both the retrieval of high-quality evidence and rigorous reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: Agreement Score Prediction followed by Multi-Agent Debate. In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage. Multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate well-reasoned verdicts with explicit justifications. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the value of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac74\uac15 \uad00\ub828 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ud655\uc0b0\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac74\uac15 \uad00\ub828 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ud569\uc758 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud1a0\ub860\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ucda9\ud558\ub294 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc885\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc815\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud310\uacb0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc790\ub3d9 \uc810\uc218\ud654\uc640 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uac80\uc99d \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac74\uac15 \uad00\ub828 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778\uc740 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ud655\uc0b0\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0\ub294 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc99d\uac70\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac74\uac15 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4: \ud569\uc758 \uc810\uc218 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860\uc774\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \uae30\uc0ac\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc99d\uac70 \uc785\uc7a5\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ud569\uc758 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc810\uc218\uac00 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc774\ud558\ub85c \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc838 \ud569\uc758\uac00 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \ud310\ub2e8\ub418\uba74, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud1a0\ub860\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ucda9\ud558\ub294 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc885\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc815\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc798 \uadfc\uac70 \uc788\ub294 \ud310\uacb0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uae30\uc900 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uac80\uc99d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc810\uc218\ud654\uc640 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uacb0\ud569\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We focus on state entropy maximization (SEM), where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the entropy of the state stationary distribution. In this paper, we introduce SEMDICE, a principled off-policy algorithm that computes an SEM policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset, which optimizes the policy directly within the space of stationary distributions. SEMDICE computes a single, stationary Markov state-entropy-maximizing policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMDICE outperforms baseline algorithms in maximizing state entropy while achieving the best adaptation efficiency for downstream tasks among SEM-based unsupervised RL pre-training methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEMDICE\ub294 \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c1\ud0dc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uadf9\ub300\ud654(SEM)\ub97c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, SEMDICE\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 SEM \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc SEMDICE\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uae30\uc900 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uace0, SEM \uae30\ubc18 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 RL \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SEMDICE\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec \uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc77c\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uadf9\ub300\ud654 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc815\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 SEM(\uc0c1\ud0dc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uadf9\ub300\ud654)\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 SEM \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 SEMDICE\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

As systems increasingly deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) applications, these systems face evolving phishing email threats that exploit their fundamental architectures. Current LLMs require substantial hardening before deployment in email security systems, particularly against coordinated multi-vector attacks that exploit architectural vulnerabilities. This paper proposes LLMPEA, an LLM-based framework to detect phishing email attacks across multiple attack vectors, including prompt injection, text refinement, and multilingual attacks. We evaluate three frontier LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Grok-3) and comprehensive prompting design to assess their feasibility, robustness, and limitations against phishing email attacks. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs can detect the phishing email over 90% accuracy while we also highlight that LLM-based phishing email detection systems could be exploited by adversarial attack, prompt injection, and multilingual attacks. Our findings provide critical insights for LLM-based phishing detection in real-world settings where attackers exploit multiple vulnerabilities in combination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uacf5\uaca9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LLMPEA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub420 \ub54c \ub2e4\uc911 \uacf5\uaca9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\ub4e4\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ube44\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LLMPEA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 prompt injection, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\uc81c, \ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 LLM(GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, Grok-3)\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, 90% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc870\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\uc2f1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774\uba54\uc77c \ud53c\uc2f1\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uce68\uc785\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac LLM\uc740 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac15\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc545\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubca1\ud130 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uadf8\ub7ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\uc81c, \ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LLMPEA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucd5c\uc2e0 LLM(GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, Grok-3)\uacfc \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uacac\uace0\uc131 \ubc0f \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, LLM\uc774 90% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1d\ud614\uc73c\uba70, LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc545\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\ub3c4 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc870\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc545\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\uc2f1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity.

While open-weight LLMs enable local deployment, no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches. However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task. Our work advances scalable, low-resource, and zero-shot NER by effectively combining multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning.

However, FL remains susceptible to privacy threats that can compromise data via direct means. That said, indirectly compromising the confidentiality of the FL model architecture (e.g., a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN)) on a client device by an outsider remains unexplored. If leaked, this information can enable next-level attacks tailored to the architecture. This paper proposes a novel side-channel fingerprinting attack, leveraging flow-level and packet-level statistics of encrypted wireless traffic from an FL client to infer its deep learning model architecture. We name it FLARE, a fingerprinting framework based on FL Architecture REconnaissance. Evaluation across various CNN and RNN variants-including pre-trained and custom models trained over IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi-shows that FLARE achieves over 98% F1-score in closed-world and up to 91% in open-world scenarios.

Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions. This automated framework paves the way toward standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for future biomolecular and drug design applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "DynaMate\ub294 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \ubc0f \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8-\ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\uccb4 \ubd84\uc790 \uc5ed\ud559(MD) \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MD \uc124\uc815\uc758 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DynaMate\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9, \uc6f9 \uac80\uc0c9, PaperQA \ubc0f \uc790\uae30 \uc218\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec MD \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "DynaMate\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uacf5\ub960, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0dd\uccb4 \ubd84\uc790\uc758 \uad6c\uc870 \ubc0f \uc57d\ubb3c \uc124\uacc4 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc758 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud3ec\uc2a4 \ud544\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\uc790 \uc5ed\ud559(MD) \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \ubc0f \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8-\ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc \ubcf5\ud569\uccb4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc0dd\uccb4 \ubd84\uc790 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870, \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc57d\ubb3c \ubc1c\uacac\uacfc \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \uaca9\uc8fc\uc801\uc778 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654, \uc785\ub825 \uc900\ube44 \ubc0f \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad6c\uc131 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 MD \uc124\uc815\uc758 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc740 \ub110\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 LLM\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uacfc\ud559 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8-\ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc MD \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DynaMate\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac70\uc2dc\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc791\uc6a9 \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uac70\uc2dc\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\ucd5c\uc18c \uc791\uc6a9 \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec LLM \ub0b4\ubd80\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uac04 \uc804\uc774 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud568.", "result": "LLM \uc0dd\uc131 \uc804\uc774\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 LLM \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uaddc\uce59 \uc9d1\ud569\uacfc \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud568\uc218 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc138\ubd80 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 LLM \uc0dd\uc131 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uac70\uc2dc\uc801 \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac70\uc2dc\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\ud589\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc131\uacf5\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uac70\uc2dc\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud3b8\uc9c0\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub41c LLM\uc758 \uae30\uc800 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc791\uc6a9 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, serverless cloud users remain vulnerable to various types of attacks, including micro-architectural side-channel attacks. These attacks typically rely on the physical co-location of victim and attacker instances, and attackers will need to exploit cloud schedulers to achieve co-location with victims. Therefore, it is crucial to study vulnerabilities in serverless cloud schedulers and assess the security of different serverless scheduling algorithms. This study addresses the gap in understanding and constructing co-location attacks in serverless clouds. We present a comprehensive methodology to uncover exploitable features in serverless scheduling algorithms and devise strategies for constructing co-location attacks through normal user interfaces. In our experiments, we successfully reveal exploitable vulnerabilities and achieve instance co-location on prevalent open-source infrastructures and Microsoft Azure Functions. We also present a mitigation strategy to defend against co-location attacks in serverless clouds. Our work highlights critical areas for security enhancements in current cloud schedulers, offering insights to fortify serverless computing environments against potential co-location attacks.", "AI":

However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication.

Deep learning mod- els often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Med- ical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician- derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare- class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines.

While traditional IDS approaches rely heavily on signature-based methods, they struggle to detect novel and evolving attacks. This paper presents an advanced IDS framework that leverages adversarial training and dynamic neural networks in 5G/6G networks to enhance network security by providing robust, real-time threat detection and response capabilities. Unlike conventional models, which require costly retraining to update knowledge, the proposed framework integrates incremental learning algorithms, reducing the need for frequent retraining. Adversarial training is used to fortify the IDS against poisoned data. By using fewer features and incorporating statistical properties, the system can efficiently detect potential threats. Extensive evaluations using the NSL- KDD dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach provides better accuracy of 82.33% for multiclass classification of various network attacks while resisting dataset poisoning. This research highlights the potential of adversarial-trained, dynamic neural networks for building resilient IDS solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 5G/6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uace0\uae09 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(IDS) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ub300\uc751 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 IDS \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc11c\uba85 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec IDS\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a6\uc740 \uc7ac\uad50\uc721\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "NSL-KDD \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 82.33%\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc624\uc5fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc800\ud56d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801\uc778 IDS \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uad6c\ucd95\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(IDS)\uc740 5G/6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubc0f \uc678\ubd80 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 IDS \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc11c\uba85 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc0f \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 5G/6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uace0\uae09 IDS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ub300\uc751 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uc2fc \uc7ac\uad50\uc721\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 IDS\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc801\uc740 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics.

Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \\textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \\textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction.

In this work, we introduce \\textbf{MJA}, a \\textbf{m}etaphor-based \\textbf{j}ailbreaking \\textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to effectively and efficiently attack diverse defense mechanisms without prior knowledge of their type by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts. Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO). MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation. Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. To enhance attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts. Extensive experiments on T2I models with various external and internal defense mechanisms demonstrate that MJA outperforms six baseline methods, achieving stronger attack performance while using fewer queries.

Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios.

CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction. Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution. We propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics. Results reveal that most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Interestingly, excessive reasoning steps can sometimes prove counterproductive, while top models tend to exhibit reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge.

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ub8e8\ud504\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc758\ubbf8 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774\uc0b0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ubc18\ubcf5 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f8.", "result": "\ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70 \uac01\uac01 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ub9e4\ub825\uc810\uacfc \ubb34\ud55c \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc774 \ub300\ub9ac \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc758 \uc218\ub834, \ubc1c\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uada4\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uac01 \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc7ac\uadc0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9(\uc218\ub834, \ubc1c\uc0b0 \ub610\ub294 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294\uc9c0)\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ub9ac \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \ubc18\ubcf5 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc774\uc0b0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \ubcc0\ud658\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\ubb3c \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uce21\uc815\uc774 \uc218\ud589\ub418\ub294 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucf54\uc0ac\uc778 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc774 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ube44\ub4f1\ubc29\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \ud310\ub2e8\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc628 \ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uada4\uc801, \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ubc0f \ub9e4\ub825\uc810\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \uce21\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c \ub300\ub9ac \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc218\ucd95 \uc7ac\uc791\uc131 \ub8e8\ud504\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ub9e4\ub825\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud558\uace0, \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \uc694\uc57d \ubc0f \ubd80\uc815 \ub8e8\ud504\ub294 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ud615\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubb34\ud55c \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc218\ucd95\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc758 \uc815 qualitatively distinct geometry signatures\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ub300\ub9ac \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5 LLM \ubcc0\ud658\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ub834, \ubc1c\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uada4\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the \"Lazy Reviewer\" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping \"Reject\" decisions to \"Accept,\" for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like \"Maximum Mark Magyk\" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models.

Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc5ed\ud560 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\uc220 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc81c\ub3c4\uc801 \ucc45\uc784 \uac04 \uac2d\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 AI\ub97c \uc704\ud55c 10\uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 Governance\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud328\ub110 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ub9e1\uac8c \ub418\uba74\uc11c \uae30\uc220\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc81c\ub3c4\uc801 \ucc45\uc784 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc774 \ud655\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc785\ub825, \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uac10\uc0ac \ubc0f \ucd9c\ucc98 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 AI\ub97c \uc704\ud55c 10\uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 AI \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c, \uc18c\ube44\uc790 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 Governance umbrella\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 AI \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \uae30\uc874\uc758 AI \uc774\ub2c8\uc154\ud2f0\ube0c\uc640\ub294 \ucc28\ubcc4\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uba70 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ub9e1\uac8c \ub418\uba74\uc11c \uae30\uc220\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc81c\ub3c4\uc801 \ucc45\uc784 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc774 \ud655\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc9c0\uce68\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\ub97c \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc785\ub825, \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uac10\uc0ac \ubc0f \ucd9c\ucc98 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud328\ub110 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 AI\ub97c \uc704\ud55c 10\uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 AI \uac04 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc774\ub2c8\uc154\ud2f0\ube0c\uc640\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 AI \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c, \uc18c\ube44\uc790 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc758 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc6b0\uc0b0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6d\uc81c \ud45c\uc900\uacfc \ud638\uc8fc\uc758 AI \ubcf4\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6d\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5f4\ub9dd\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc2e4\ud589 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uba70 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "InfoCom\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc911\uc2ec \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uacfc\ubd80\ud558\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub192\uc740 \uc778\uc2dd \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud611\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "InfoCom\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc911\uc2ec \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "InfoCom\uc740 \uba54\uac00\ubc14\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0ac\ub85c\ubc14\uc774\ud2b8 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uac70\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "InfoCom\uc740 Where2comm \ubc0f ERMVP\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac01\uac01 440\ubc30 \ubc0f 90\ubc30\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uc778\uc2dd\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud611\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uc2e0-\uc131\ub2a5 \uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud611\ub825\ub2f9 MB \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\ud328\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 InfoCom\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation.

While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AI\uc758 \uba54\ud0c0\uc778\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uc640 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0-d' \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc804\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba54\ud0c0\uc778\uc9c0\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc778\uc9c0\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\ub85c, \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ud310\ub2e8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774\ub2e4.

General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency.

Traditional mechanistic models struggle with empirical parameter variability, while purely data-driven models lack physical consistency and rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ). This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual). Crucially, we implement a full UQ methodology by decomposing the total predictive variance (sigma2_total) into model uncertainty (epistemic, from GPR's posterior variance) and input uncertainty (aleatoric, analytically propagated via the Delta method for multi-variate correlated inputs). Leveraging the inherent strength of GPR in low-data regimes, the model, trained on a meagre 120 data points, achieved a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on the independent test data, validating a truly robust and reliable surrogate model for advanced FO process optimization and digital twin development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc120\uc9c4 \uc5ed\uc0bc\ud22c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ubb3c \ubd84\ub9ac \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubb3c\ub9ac-\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "FO \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub85c \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc9c8\ub7c9 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc218\ubd84 \uc720\uc18d(Jw)\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ud68c\uadc0(GPR)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec FO \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uc218\ubd84 \uc720\uc18d \uac04\uc758 \uc794\ucc28 \uc624\ub958\ub85c GPR\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 120\uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \ub3c5\ub9bd \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 \uc808\ub300 \ubc31\ubd84\uc728 \uc624\ucc28(MAPE) 0.26% \ubc0f R2 0.999\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub85c\uc368 FO \uacf5\uc815 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud2b8\uc708 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\ubc29 \uc0bc\ud22c(FO)\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc800\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ub9c9 \ubd84\ub9ac \uae30\uc220\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc9c8\ub7c9 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubb3c \uc720\uc18d(Jw)\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0, \uc21c\uc218 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654(UQ\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uba74\uc11c Jw \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ud68c\uadc0(GPR)\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubb3c\ub9ac-\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud575\uc2ec \ud601\uc2e0\uc740 \uc0c1\uc138\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc778 FO \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21(Jw_physical)\uacfc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \ubb3c \uc720\uc18d(Jw_actual) \uac04\uc758 \uc794\ucc28 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 GPR\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc0c1\uad00 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub378\ud0c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud30c\ub41c \uc785\ub825 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131(\uc6b0\uc5f0\uc801)\uacfc GPR\uc758 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc778\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131(\uc778\uc2dd\uc801)\uc73c\ub85c \ucd1d \uc608\uce21 \ubd84\uc0b0(sigma2_total)\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 UQ \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc801\uc740 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 GPR\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, 120\uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3c5\ub9bd \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c 0.26%\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc808\ub300 \ubc31\ubd84\uc728 \uc624\ucc28(MAPE)\uc640 0.999\uc758 R2\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec FO \uacf5\uc815 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud2b8\uc708 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c4\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "EmerFlow\ub294 \uc2e0\ud765 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc744 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ud765 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\ud765 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc758 \ucd94\ucc9c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc774 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "EmerFlow\ub294 LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\ud765 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc758 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ucd94\ucc9c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 EmerFlow\uac00 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EmerFlow\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ud765 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub204\uc801\ub418\ub294 \uc2e0\ud765 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc744 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ud765 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc774 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uac70\uc758 \uc5c6\uac70\ub098 \uc804\ud600 \uc5c6\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc88b\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2e0\ud765 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc758 \uace0\uc720\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uacfc\uc758 \uacf5\uc720 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 EmerFlow\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ud765 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\ud765 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc758 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \ud574\ub2f9 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uae30\uc874 \ucd94\ucc9c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \uc815\ub82c\ud55c \ud6c4, \uba54\ud0c0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 EmerFlow\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ud765 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc601\ud654 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c EmerFlow\uac00 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process.

However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets. The method offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 LLM\ub4e4\uc740 \ub300\ub2f5\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \ube44\ub300\ud654\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubc18\uc751\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\uc640 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucd94\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d LLM\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud68c\uc804 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uace0 \ub4e3\uace0 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc218\ud559, \uc0c1\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ube44\uc0dd\uac01 \ud1a0\ud070\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\ucd95\uacfc \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 6-11\ubc30 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 LLM\uc774 \ube44 sequential \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubc18\uc751\ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub35c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc785\ub825\uc774 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba74 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uac01\uc744 \uba48\ucdb0\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc74c\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \ub610\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud615 \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uac00 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc751\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc\ub294 \uc0c1\ucda9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74 \uc778\uac04\uc740 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub4e3\uace0, \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uace0, \ud589\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc77d\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uace0, \ub2f5\uc744 \uc791\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \uacc4\uc18d \uc0dd\uac01\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd94\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c LLM\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud68c\uc804 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc758 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c LLM\uc774 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uace0 \ub4e3\uace0 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\ud559, \uc0c1\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \uc99d\uac15 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ube44\uc0dd\uac01 \ud1a0\ud070\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub3c4\ub2ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubd84\uc5d0\uc11c 5\ucd08 \uc774\ud558\ub85c \ub2e8\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uccb4 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 6-11\ubc30 \uc904\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation (\"1-NFE\") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "BiFlow\ub294 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ud574\uc11d\uc801 \uc5ed\ud568\uc218 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc791\uc5c5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 Bidirectional Normalizing Flow \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Normalizing Flows\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd5c\uadfc TARFlow\uc640 \ubcc0\ud615\ub4e4\uc740 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "BiFlow\ub294 \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \ub178\uc774\uc988-\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5ed \ub9e4\ud551\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uc5ed \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ImageNet\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, BiFlow\ub294 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub450 \ubc30\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "BiFlow\ub294 NF \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub178\uba40\ub77c\uc774\uc9d5 \ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0(Normalizing Flows, NFs)\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 NFs\ub294 \uc804\ubc29 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc640 \uc5ed\ubc29\ud5a5 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc29 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uace0, \uc5ed\ubc29\ud5a5 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \ubc18\uc804\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 NF \uc804\ubc29 \ubcc0\ud658\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc5ed\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5ed\ubc29\ud5a5 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uac00 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud574\uc11d\uc801 \uc5ed\ud568\uc218\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc TARFlow\uc640 \uadf8 \ubcc0\ud615\ub4e4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\uc640 \uc790\uae30 \ud68c\uadc0 \ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec NF \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc7ac\ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc73c\ub85c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud574\uc11d\uc801 \uc5ed\ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 Bidirectional Normalizing Flow (BiFlow) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions.

This work aims to answer a fundamental question: How does diversity of values shape the collective behavior of AI communities? Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability.

However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a \"passive accumulation\" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning.

General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.\n  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.\n  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.\n  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases.

Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through \"concept deliberation\", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc815\uc758\ud560 \uc218

Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $\u03c1\\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\\geq 0.5$ after 10\\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc81c\uc548\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc81c\ucd9c\ub41c \uc81c\uc548\uc11c \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \uc810\uc218 \ub9e4\uae30\uae30\ub294 \uc57d\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uc640 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\uc758 \ud3b8\uacac \ubc0f \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc131\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubd80\ubd84 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc548\uc11c\uc758 \ube44\uad50 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM \ub7ad\ud0b9\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ub7ad\ud0b9\uacfc \uac15\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ucd9c\ud310 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc81c\uc548\uc11c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 100\ubc30 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc808\uac10\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLMs\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\uc11c \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc758 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0\uac8c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uace0\uae09 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub9ac\ubdf0 \uc704\uc6d0\ud68c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc2dc\uc124\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc81c\ucd9c\ub41c \uc81c\uc548\uc11c \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \uc810\uc218 \ub9e4\uae30\uae30\ub294 \uc57d\ud55c \uc81c\uc548\uc11c \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9ac\uace0 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\uc758 \ud3b8\uacac\uacfc \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc30d\ub300 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uc5ec \ub7ad\ud0b9\uc758 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucca0\uc800\ud558\uace0 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \uc774\ucc28 \uc791\uc5c5\ub7c9\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\uc5d0\uac8c \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments.
