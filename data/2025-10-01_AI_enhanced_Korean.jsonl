To address this, we introduce the Multi-Objective Markov\nGame (MOMG), a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning with multiple\nobjectives. We propose the Pareto-Nash Equilibrium (PNE) as the primary\nsolution concept, where no agent can unilaterally improve one objective without\nsacrificing performance on another. We prove existence of PNE, and establish an\nequivalence between the PNE and the set of Nash Equilibria of MOMG's\ncorresponding linearly scalarized games, enabling solutions of MOMG by\ntransferring to a standard single-objective Markov game. However, we note that\ncomputing a PNE is theoretically and computationally challenging, thus we\npropose and study weaker but more tractable solution concepts. Building on\nthese foundations, we develop online learning algorithm that identify a single\nsolution to MOMGs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase, preference-free\nalgorithm that decouples exploration from planning. Our algorithm enables\ncomputation of a PNE for any given preference profile without collecting new\nsamples, providing an efficient methodological characterization of the entire\nPareto-Nash front.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac8c\uc784(MOMG) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uae30\ubcf8 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uac1c\ub150\uc73c\ub85c \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0-\ub0b4\uc26c \uade0\ud615(PNE)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Minor\nerrors can propagate across agents, escalating into task failures while\nproducing long, intertwined execution trajectories that impose significant\ncosts for both human developers and automated systems to debug and analyze. Our\nkey insight is that, despite surface differences in failure trajectories (e.g.,\nlogs), MAS errors often recur with similar structural patterns. This paper\npresents CORRECT, the first lightweight, training-free framework that leverages\nan online cache of distilled error schemata to recognize and transfer knowledge\nof failure structures across new requests. This cache-based reuse allows LLMs\nto perform targeted error localization at inference time, avoiding the need for\nexpensive retraining while adapting to dynamic MAS deployments in subseconds.\nTo support rigorous study in this domain, we also introduce CORRECT-Error, a\nlarge-scale dataset of over 2,000 annotated trajectories collected through a\nnovel error-injection pipeline guided by real-world distributions, and further\nvalidated through human evaluation to ensure alignment with natural failure\npatterns. Experiments across seven diverse MAS applications show that CORRECT\nimproves step-level error localization up to 19.8% over existing advances while\nat near-zero overhead, substantially narrowing the gap between automated and\nhuman-level error recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c

LLM-Aided Categorization of Security Patches for Critical Memory Bugs", "comment": null, "summary": "Open-source software projects are foundational to modern software ecosystems,\nwith the Linux kernel standing out as a critical exemplar due to its ubiquity\nand complexity. Although security patches are continuously integrated into the\nLinux mainline kernel, downstream maintainers often delay their adoption,\ncreating windows of vulnerability. A key reason for this lag is the difficulty\nin identifying security-critical patches, particularly those addressing\nexploitable vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds (OOB) accesses and\nuse-after-free (UAF) bugs. This challenge is exacerbated by intentionally\nsilent bug fixes, incomplete or missing CVE assignments, delays in CVE\nissuance, and recent changes to the CVE assignment criteria for the Linux\nkernel. While fine-grained patch classification approaches exist, they exhibit\nlimitations in both coverage and accuracy. In this work, we identify previously\nunexplored opportunities to significantly improve fine-grained patch\nclassification. Specifically, by leveraging cues from commit titles/messages\nand diffs alongside appropriate code context, we develop DUALLM, a dual-method\npipeline that integrates two approaches based on a Large Language Model (LLM)\nand a fine-tuned small language model.

Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer\nautomated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to\nbuild specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal\nlanguages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve\nsubstantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural\nlanguage. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by\ncombining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal\nverification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that\nexcels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4\ntactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem\nthat the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to\nsplit the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.\nIt leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms\nexisting approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points\nabove the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known\nresult on PutnamBench.

This paradigm has\nrapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke\nconfiguration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward\nframeworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic\nmulti-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM\nagent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}''\nparadigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the\ndynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this\nlimitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of\nrecursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects\nbespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a\n``\\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of\ndynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in\nresponse to real-time task demands. Collaborative Tree Optimization is proposed\nto train and specialize these meta-agents. Extensive evaluation across seven\nbenchmarks reveals that MAS$^2$ achieves performance gains of up to $19.6\\%$\nover state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios such as deep research and code\ngeneration. Moreover, MAS$^2$ exhibits superior cross-backbone generalization,\neffectively leveraging previously unseen LLMs to yield improvements of up to\n$15.1\\%$. Crucially, these gains are attained without incurring excessive token\ncosts, as MAS$^2$ consistently resides on the Pareto frontier of\ncost-performance trade-offs.

To our knowledge, this is the first protocol level, deployment\nscale audit of MCP in vision systems, identifying systemic weaknesses in schema\nsemantics, interoperability, and runtime coordination. We analyze 91 publicly\nregistered vision centric MCP servers, annotated along nine dimensions of\ncompositional fidelity, and develop an executable benchmark with validators to\ndetect and categorize protocol violations. The audit reveals high prevalence of\nschema format divergence, missing runtime schema validation, undeclared\ncoordinate conventions, and reliance on untracked bridging scripts. Validator\nbased testing quantifies these failures, with schema format checks flagging\nmisalignments in 78.0 percent of systems, coordinate convention checks\ndetecting spatial reference errors in 24.6 percent, and memory scope checks\nissuing an average of 33.8 warnings per 100 executions. Security probes show\nthat dynamic and multi agent workflows exhibit elevated risks of privilege\nescalation and untyped tool connections.

While these systems demonstrate immense potential and\npower, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their\nefficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a\ncritical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's\ntasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial\nTesting (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the\ncomplex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended\nobjectives.\n  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic\ninteraction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic\nAI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This\nsynthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure\nmodes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT\nframework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling\nmore effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec Agentic AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacfc\uc81c\uc640 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ub3c4\uad6c \ubc0f \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc5d0\ub9cc \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, Agentic AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacfc\uc81c\uc640 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacf5\ubc31\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 Agentic AI \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CAT \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 Alexa+ \uc624\ub514\uc624 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud3b8\ub9ac\ud55c Agentic AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 CAT \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ubaa9\ud45c-\uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec Agentic AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Agentic AI\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub9c9\ub300\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ub3c4\uad6c \ubc0f \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc8fc\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 Agentic AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc5d0\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacf5\ubc31\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Agentic AI \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CAT \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c Alexa+ \uc624\ub514\uc624 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 CAT \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ubaa9\ud45c-\uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub358 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec Agentic AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

These\nuncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental\nvariability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons\ndownstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional\ncentralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational\ncomplexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while\nexisting multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve\neffective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we\npresent MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by\nstarling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment,\nseparation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs\nto make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In\naddition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to\nadapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on\nreal-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\\%,\ncuts computation by 35\\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\\%, exhibiting\nsuper-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000\nnodes.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for\nenhancing threat analysis. However, their effectiveness in real-world blue team\nthreat-hunting scenarios remains insufficiently explored. This paper presents\nCyberTeam, a benchmark designed to guide LLMs in blue teaming practice.\nCyberTeam constructs a standardized workflow in two stages. First, it models\nrealistic threat-hunting workflows by capturing the dependencies among\nanalytical tasks from threat attribution to incident response. Next, each task\nis addressed through a set of operational modules tailored to its specific\nanalytical requirements. This transforms threat hunting into a structured\nsequence of reasoning steps, with each step grounded in a discrete operation\nand ordered according to task-specific dependencies. Guided by this framework,\nLLMs are directed to perform threat-hunting tasks through modularized steps.\nOverall, CyberTeam integrates 30 tasks and 9 operational modules to guide LLMs\nthrough standardized threat analysis.

Its asymmetry of information and reliance on\ntheory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a\nuseful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models\n(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified\nfour-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set\nthe mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso\nduring the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and\nvoting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through\nrole-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must\ndetect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To\nmeasure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the\nMini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates\nwithin fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them\nusing standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without\nexternal data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each\none serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our\nexperiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller\nmodels outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables\nquantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and\nlast-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training\ndata for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities\nagainst human baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub9c8\ud53c\uc544\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc131\uacfc \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ub9c8\uc74c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ucd94\ub9ac \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4.

This paper introduces a novel\nframework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies\nin these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training\nprocess that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging\npolicy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy\ndistribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,\ntraining the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target.

Android task-executable VAs are applications\nthat are capable of understanding complex tasks and performing corresponding\noperations. Given their prevalence and great autonomy, there is no existing\nwork examine the privacy risks within the voice assistants from the\ntask-execution pattern in a holistic manner. To fill this research gap, this\npaper presents a user-centric comprehensive empirical study on privacy risks in\nAndroid task-executable VA applications. We collect ten mainstream VAs as our\nresearch target and analyze their operational characteristics.

Recent advances in large language models for complex\nreasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural\nlanguage into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,\nachieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without\nleveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate\noptimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear\nprogramming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans\ntraining data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common\nmistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference\nstrategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver\nfeedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs\ndemonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and\nfeedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,\nenabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc218\ud559\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\uc218 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc218\ud559\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc815\uc81c \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc815\uc81c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uacb0\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uade0 14% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc218\ud559\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc740 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uae30\uc220 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\ub294 \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubd88\ub7ec\uc77c\uc73c\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc18c\uc74c\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\uc218 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacc4\uc5f4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uba3c\uc800 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc624\ub958 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc815\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\uc218\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \ud074\ub798\uc2dd \uc624\ub958 \uc694\uc57d \ubc0f \uc194\ubc84 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c LLM\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\ubcf8 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc815\uc81c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud3c9\uade0 14%\uc758 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 LLM \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\uc758 \uac15\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, real-world FL deployment\nis often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial\nhuman efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),\n(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data\npre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across\nclients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and\ncross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook\nthese practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks\nmotivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent\nagents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively\nmanage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this\nend, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases\nof real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a\nbenchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to\nautonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL\nalgorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and\ncross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of\ncomplex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6\nmodality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,\nUltrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic\nperformance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,\nand large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3\ncan automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more\ncomplex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for\neven the strongest models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)

Despite advances in\nsecurity practices, the lack of high-quality datasets capturing diverse exploit\nbehavior limits effective vulnerability assessment and mitigation. This paper\nintroduces an end-to-end multi-step pipeline leveraging generative AI,\nspecifically large language models (LLMs), to address the challenges of\norchestrating and reproducing attacks to known software vulnerabilities. Our\napproach extracts information from CVE disclosures in the National\nVulnerability Database, augments it with external public knowledge (e.g.,\nthreat advisories, code snippets) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),\nand automates the creation of containerized environments and exploit code for\neach vulnerability. The pipeline iteratively refines generated artifacts,\nvalidates attack success with test cases, and supports complex multi-container\nsetups. Our methodology overcomes key obstacles, including noisy and incomplete\nvulnerability descriptions, by integrating LLMs and RAG to fill information\ngaps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline across different\nvulnerability types, such as memory overflows, denial of service, and remote\ncode execution, spanning diverse programming languages, libraries and years. In\ndoing so, we uncover significant inconsistencies in CVE descriptions,\nemphasizing the need for more rigorous verification in the CVE disclosure\nprocess. Our approach is model-agnostic, working across multiple LLMs, and we\nopen-source the artifacts to enable reproducibility and accelerate security\nresearch. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system to\nsystematically orchestrate and exploit known vulnerabilities in containerized\nenvironments by combining general-purpose LLM reasoning with CVE data and\nRAG-based context enrichment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uace0

Yet their effectiveness is\nfundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal\nconfiguration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,\nlayer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices\ndictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies\non ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often\nleading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces\nOptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a\nrigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR\nefficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as\nsinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and\ntheir associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach\nreplaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization\nprocess.

We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a\nfoundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of\nnormalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories\ninto coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary\nmodalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent\ntransitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised\nmasked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across\nmodalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual\nlabels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and\nGeolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as\ntrajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most\npronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual\nreasoning is critical.

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants, which offer simple code\ncompletion and suggestions, modern coding agents tackle more complex tasks with\ngreater autonomy, such as generating entire programs from natural language\ninstructions. To enable such capabilities, modern coding agents incorporate\nextensive functionalities, which in turn raise significant concerns over their\nsecurity and privacy. Despite their growing adoption, systematic and in-depth\nsecurity analysis of these agents has largely been overlooked.\n  In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis of eight\nreal-world coding agents. Our analysis addresses the limitations of prior\napproaches, which were often fragmented and ad hoc, by systematically examining\nthe internal workflows of coding agents and identifying security threats across\ntheir components. Through the analysis, we identify 15 security issues,\nincluding previously overlooked or missed issues, that can be abused to\ncompromise the confidentiality and integrity of user systems. Furthermore, we\nshow that these security issues are not merely individual vulnerabilities, but\ncan collectively lead to end-to-end exploitations. By leveraging these security\nissues, we successfully achieved arbitrary command execution in five agents and\nglobal data exfiltration in four agents, all without any user interaction or\napproval. Our findings highlight the need for a comprehensive security analysis\nin modern LLM-driven agents and demonstrate how insufficient security\nconsiderations can lead to severe vulnerabilities.", "AI":

Almost universally, Large Language Models\n(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and\ncan be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding\nof their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created\ndozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive\npsychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is\nsolvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be\ninsufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions\nand asking them to report the resulting object after performing the\ntransformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by\ntesting 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best\nLLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we\ntested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the\nstrongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.\nThese results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to\ncomplete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their\narchitectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity\nin LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a\nnew task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly\ncapable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of\nrepresentation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional\nreasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete\ntasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud55c\uc815\ub418\uc5b4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc778\uc9c0 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc758 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc2ed \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ud5d8\uc790\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uace0\uc758 LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0ac\uace0 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \ud560\ub2f9\ud560 \ub54c \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc758\uc874 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc774\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub17c\uc7c1\uc744 \uc7ac\uc810\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac70\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uba70, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud55c\uc815\ub418\uc5b4 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac00\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc758 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc2ed \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc9c0 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574\uc11c\ub9cc \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4(\uc989, \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4).

To resolve these problems, we\npropose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism\nthat reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a\ndistinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each\nquery via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this\nlocal adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength\nin capturing long-range dependencies.

Unlike mature software ecosystems with\nrigorous vetting, MCP servers still lack standardized review mechanisms, giving\nadversaries opportunities to distribute malicious implementations. Despite this\npressing risk, the security implications of MCP servers remain underexplored.\nTo address this gap, we present the first systematic study that treats MCP\nservers as active threat actors and decomposes them into core components to\nexamine how adversarial developers can implant malicious intent. Specifically,\nwe investigate three research questions: (i) what types of attacks malicious\nMCP servers can launch, (ii) how vulnerable MCP hosts and Large Language Models\n(LLMs) are to these attacks, and (iii) how feasible it is to carry out MCP\nserver attacks in practice. Our study proposes a component-based taxonomy\ncomprising twelve attack categories. For each category, we develop\nProof-of-Concept (PoC) servers and demonstrate their effectiveness across\ndiverse real-world host-LLM settings. We further show that attackers can\ngenerate large numbers of malicious servers at virtually no cost.

Building on this potential, we implemented\na Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from\nsequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data\ncollected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions\nare two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)\nroutine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing\neach day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic\npersonalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from\nindividuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on\n6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area\nUnder the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and\ndemographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of\nscalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive\nsensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0 \uc13c\uc2f1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub178\uc778\ub4e4\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc190\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc608\ubc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uc560\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc801\uc2dc \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc784\uc0c1 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ube48\ub3c4\uac00 \ub0ae\uc544 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\uc640 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc131\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc9c0 \uc190\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LSTM \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790 \uac04 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub8e8\ud2f4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc99d\uac15 \ubc0f \uc778\uad6c \ud1b5\uacc4 \ub9de\ucda4\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "36\uba85\uc758 \ub178\uc778\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c 6\uac1c\uc6d4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 AUPRC\uc744 0.637\uc5d0\uc11c 0.766\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc13c\uc2f1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \uc190\uc0c1\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uc560\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc801\uc2dc \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc784\uc0c1 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ube48\ub3c4\uac00 \ub0ae\uc544 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\uc640 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0 \uc13c\uc2f1\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\uc778\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 1\ub144\uac04\uc758 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc911\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc13c\uc2f1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc9c0 \uc190\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790 \uac04 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc77c\ubc18\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ub8e8\ud2f4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc99d\uac15\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\uc77c\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\uc131 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, (2) \uc778\uad6c \ud1b5\uacc4 \ub9de\ucda4\ud654\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790\uc640 \uc778\uad6c\ud1b5\uacc4\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \uac15\uc870\ub97c \ub450\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 36\uba85\uc758 \ub178\uc778\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 6\uac1c\uc6d4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc13c\uc2f1 \ubc0f \uc778\uad6c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 AUPRC\uc744 0.637\uc5d0\uc11c 0.766\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec, \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc13c\uc2f1\uc73c\ub85c \ub178\uc778 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc9c0 \uc190\uc0c1\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A key component of these systems is the shared\nfunction library, a collection of software tools that agents use to process\nsensor data and navigate complex driving environments. Despite its critical\nrole in agent decision-making, the function library remains an under-explored\nvulnerability. In this paper, we introduce FuncPoison, a novel poisoning-based\nattack targeting the function library to manipulate the behavior of LLM-driven\nmulti-agent autonomous systems. FuncPoison exploits two key weaknesses in how\nagents access the function library: (1) agents rely on text-based instructions\nto select tools; and (2) these tools are activated using standardized command\nformats that attackers can replicate. By injecting malicious tools with\ndeceptive instructions, FuncPoison manipulates one agent s decisions--such as\nmisinterpreting road conditions--triggering cascading errors that mislead other\nagents in the system. We experimentally evaluate FuncPoison on two\nrepresentative multi-agent autonomous driving systems, demonstrating its\nability to significantly degrade trajectory accuracy, flexibly target specific\nagents to induce coordinated misbehavior, and evade diverse defense mechanisms.\nOur results reveal that the function library, often considered a simple\ntoolset, can serve as a critical attack surface in LLM-based autonomous driving\nsystems, raising elevated concerns on their reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub97c \uaca8\ub0e5\ud55c FuncPoison\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ub2a5 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FuncPoison\uc740 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uae30\ub9cc\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc870\uc791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "FuncPoison\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\ub2a5 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc138\ud2b8\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\ub85c \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \uae30\ub2a5 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc13c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc8fc\ud589 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubaa8\uc74c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud568\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uae30\ub2a5 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uc870\uc791\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\ub2a5 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub97c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3ec\uc774\uc9d5 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc778 FuncPoison\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent approaches\ntrain large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online\nRL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our\nexperimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a\ncontinue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,\nwe identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own\nstochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly\nresembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a\nvicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we\nintroduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed\nICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing\nthe ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current\ncontext. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant\ninformation, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We\nprove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap\nrelative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two\nmethods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.\nExperiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that\nCV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL\nabilities across various tasks and environments.

Current Wi-Fi\nsystems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal\ncollision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges\ndue to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization\nwith legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection\nmechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral\nevents while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA\noperations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with\nenhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable\nmedium access opportunities.

Instead of exhaustively constructing\nthe payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,\nmultiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB\noracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within\nthe generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the\nneed to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of\nTwo-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn\nPoker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,\nhas 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards\nsimultaneously.

State-of-the-art prevention-based defenses typically\nrely on fine-tuning an LLM to enhance its security, but they achieve limited\neffectiveness against strong attacks. In this work, we propose \\emph{SecInfer},\na novel defense against prompt injection attacks built on \\emph{inference-time\nscaling}, an emerging paradigm that boosts LLM capability by allocating more\ncompute resources for reasoning during inference. SecInfer consists of two key\nsteps: \\emph{system-prompt-guided sampling}, which generates multiple responses\nfor a given input by exploring diverse reasoning paths through a varied set of\nsystem prompts, and \\emph{target-task-guided aggregation}, which selects the\nresponse most likely to accomplish the intended task. Extensive experiments\nshow that, by leveraging additional compute at inference, SecInfer effectively\nmitigates both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art defenses as well as existing inference-time scaling\napproaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc694\uccad \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc95\uc778 SecInfer\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 LLM\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac00\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "SecInfer\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "SecInfer\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc95 \ubc0f \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SecInfer\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubc29\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc608\ubc29 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc2e0\uc0dd \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc778 SecInfer\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While learning-based methods offer automation,\nthey suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We\nintroduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by\nleveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for\nalgorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two\ncomponents: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that\nprovides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a\nmulti-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive\nhyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in\nempirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct\nmetaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution\nand other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models\nlike Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and\naccessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design.

This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable\ntransformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model\nversions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter\nenables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full\nre-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:\nOrthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on\na small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text\ncorpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter\nrecovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full\nre-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to\noperational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,\nDrift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates\nupgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to\nvaried model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,\nand the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating\nDrift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Drift-Adapter\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc84\uc804 \uac04 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcc0\ud658 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc0b0 \ubca1\ud130 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5c5\uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub97c \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd5c\uadfc\uc811 \uc774\uc6c3(ANN) \uc778\ub371\uc2a4\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc911\ub2e8\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud06c\ub2e4.", "method": "Drift-Adapter\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 ANN \uc778\ub371\uc2a4\ub97c \uacc4\uc18d \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \uc7ac\uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ubbf8\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ud654 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine \ubc0f Compact Residual MLP\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MTEB \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\uc640 CLIP \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5c5\uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc \uc2e4\ud5d8(1M \ud56d\ubaa9)\uc5d0\uc11c Drift-Adapter\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uc7ac\uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc758 95-99% \uac80\uc0c9 \uc7ac\ud604\uc728(Recall@10, MRR)\uc744 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uba70 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 10 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucd08 \uc774\ud558\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Drift-Adapter\ub294 100\ubc30 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc7ac\uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uacfc \uac70\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc911\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc0b0 \ubca1\ud130 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5c5\uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub97c \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd5c\uadfc\uc811 \uc774\uc6c3(ANN) \uc778\ub371\uc2a4\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc911\ub2e8\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud07d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc84\uc804 \uac04 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcc0\ud658 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc778 Drift-Adapter\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

It\nsupports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying\nsemantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed\nfrom manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted\nstatistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to\ngeneralize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust\ncross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors\nthat prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy\ntrade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires\napproximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a\ncompromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.\n  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured\nreasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output\ntypes, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike\nhand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they\nare human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or\nrelational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively\nachieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization\ntasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined\nwith embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,\ndemonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

First,\nwe review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of\nExperts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two\ncorrelated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and\nscalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework\ndynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task\ncomplexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations\nin mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's\neffectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,\nvalidating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning\ncapabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c edge \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c

Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation\n(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to\ndistributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across\ntasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we\nstudy the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce\nhigh-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,\nin the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become\nstrongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and\naligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1\nvariant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the\ndominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach\nto encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On\nclass-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,\nImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces\nforgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,\nforgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved\non ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an\napproximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a\nstrong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,\nwhile EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc778 \ub9dd\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc778 \ub9dd\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c EWC\uc758 \ub7ad\ud06c-1 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uc7ac\uc0dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 FID\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac1c\uc120\ub41c Fisher \ucd94\uc815\uc73c\ub85c EWC\ub294 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\uc644 \uc218\ub2e8\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7ac\ub09c\uc801 \ub9dd\uac01\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc8fc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uacfc \ud0c4\ub825\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uace0\uc815(EWC)\uc5d0\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\ud3ec \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70, EWC\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801\uc810\uc744 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uac01\uc120 \ud53c\uc154 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc7ac\uc0dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\ud638 \ub300 \uc7a1\uc74c\ube44(SNR) \ub808\uc9d0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c\ubcc4 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub7ad\ud06c-1\uc778 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud53c\uc154\uac00 \ud3c9\uade0 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc640 \uc815\ub82c\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ub300\uac01\uc120 \uadfc\uc0ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \uace1\ub960 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 EWC\uc758 \ub7ad\ud06c-1 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \uc7ac\uc0dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc99d\ubd84 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k)\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 FID\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uc804\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ub300\uac01\uc120 EWC \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, MNIST\uc640 FashionMNIST\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9dd\uac01\uc774 \uac70\uc758 \uc81c\uac70\ub418\uba70, ImageNet-1k\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ub7b5 \uc808\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc57d 1 \ub7ad\ud06c \ud53c\uc154\ub97c \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud568\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud53c\uc154 \ucd94\uc815\uc73c\ub85c EWC\ub294 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\uc644 \uc218\ub2e8\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4: \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0, EWC\ub294 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc57d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, they\noften struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process\nReward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents\nwith crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application\nto the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial\ninputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a \"lost in the middle\"\nphenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the\nevaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing\nawareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic\nconsequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature\nof GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process\nReward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process\nreward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and\nactively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the\n``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism\nconsisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to\nactively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive\nSummarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring\nthe model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI\nchanging awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This\nmechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically\nselect the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring\nits evaluation is always informed by

Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features\nconcentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures\nmeaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may\nstrengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how\nneurons work together rather than in isolation.\n  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional\ngame theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences\ncapture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations.

This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based\nmodeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI\nagents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on\naggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1\nserves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as\ncollaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4\ntreats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network\neffects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and\nsimulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can\nsignificantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network\neffects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the\nsimple sum of individual contributions.

A major obstacle is\nscanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or\nacquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most\nharmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across\nsites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)\noffers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations\nwithout sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized\naccess to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets\nthese difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial\nNeural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive\nfederated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method\nthat stabilizes adversarial training among clients.

The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves\nabsolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted\nby noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,\nresulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through\nextensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual\nCoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.\nBuilding on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement\nmethod that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,\nproviding high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning.

In\npractice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague\nuser questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database\nentries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database\nquestion answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database\nagents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and\ngenerating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns\nof query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a\nsimulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:\nIncremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing\nqueries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their\nsearch goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,\no4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents\nachieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and\n60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is\nsubstantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build\nagents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR\ndomain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to\nguide future agent development.", "AI": {"tldr": "EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18

Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,\nparticularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored\nits impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box\nadversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully\nmislead a target model.\n  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial\nexamples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis\nconsisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336\ndistinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion\nof MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably\ndefend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success\nrate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners\nregarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM\nmethods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating\nrepresentation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight\naveraging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM\nmethod to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this\nincreased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem.

In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a\ntransferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an\nin-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it\npredicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)\ndataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as\ncontextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time\nscenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset\nmeta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ\ntabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce\na novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,\ncapturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize\nacross arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for\ntransferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3\nforecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong\nalignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,\nachieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement\ncompared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 TimeTic\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "TimeTic\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc778-\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec, \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c TSFM\uc774 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815 \ud6c4 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub3d9\uc791\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TimeTic\uc758 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uac15\ud55c \uc815\ud569\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 \uc21c\uc704 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub294 \uc57d 0.6\uc73c\ub85c, \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc810\uc218\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c\ubcf4\ub2e4 30% \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TimeTic\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ubaa8\ub378-\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uad6c\ubcc4\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc758\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(TSFMs)\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uacf5\uacf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, its adoption in deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data\nand the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning\nprocess. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains\nunique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and\nits ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to\nevolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final\nperformance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use\nof BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how\ndifferent training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify\nfailure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying\ncauses, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with\npractical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL\npipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates\nand stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances\nexploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty.

However, the structural organization of\ntheir knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience\nfindings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact\nincreases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an\nanalogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM\nknowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the\ntriplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability\nrelationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to\npossess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the\ngraph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for\ntriplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted\nknowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,\nthereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not\nonly improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject\nknowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in\nreasoning-intensive question answering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc6c3 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud3c9\uac00 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "LLM\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uc811 \ub178\ub4dc\uc640\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 GNN \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcf4\uc720\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

However, its effectiveness in\nmulti-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,\nnavigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments\nfrom mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in\nuninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we\nvalidate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and\nempirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward\nlearning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal\ndistance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance\nis learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into\ncoherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to\npolicy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in\nmulti-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.\nFurthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are\nconsistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating\nstage misalignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL)\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, STage-AlIgned Reward learning (STAIR) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "PbRL\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c1\uc811 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \ub354 \uc798 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0\ub294 \ubbf8\uc2a4\ub9e4\uce58 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\ub97c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uac70\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \ub3d9\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \ub0b4\uc758 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 STAIR \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uac70\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 STAIR\uac00 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "STAIR\ub85c \uadfc\uc0ac\ub41c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba70, \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(PbRL)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c1\uc811 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \ub354 \uc798 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5(\uc608: \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uc870\uc791)\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc798\ubabb \uc77c\uce58\ub41c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uba74 \ube44\uc815\ubcf4\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\ub97c \uba3c\uc800 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c \ub3d9\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \ub0b4\uc758 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 STage-AlIgned Reward learning (STAIR)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uac70\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5\ub418\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ucc45 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uadf8\ub8f9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 STAIR\uc758 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uacfc \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \uc778\uac04 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 STAIR\ub85c \uadfc\uc0ac\ub41c \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We re-examine\nthis perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a\nfundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To\ninvestigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state\nspace, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its\nnovel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)\nand Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our\nanalysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation\ncould be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance\nboth capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,\nVelocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the\nprinciple of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly\nshaping the RL advantage function.

At the same time, emerging low-code and\ntemplate-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly\nbuild and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as\nplatform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile\nand it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure\nroot cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these\nplatform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct\na dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each\nwith fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We\nadditionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure\nthe reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a\ntaxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution\nacross different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a\nbenchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in\nwhich we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show\nthat the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its\nutility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at\nmost 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light\nof these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such\nagentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure\nroot cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy\nand benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of\nmore reliable agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ub300\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328

Their structures are constrained by the symmetry\noperations of a crystallographic \\emph{space group} and restricted to lie in\nspecific affine subspaces known as \\emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an\natom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its\nWyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates\noverlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high\npopulations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce\nSpace Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that\nsamples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,\nstable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process\non a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a\nconditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,\nequivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to\ntheir initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is\nachieved using an efficient reformulation of \\emph{group averaging} tailored\nfor symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of\nsymmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on\ncrystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI\nagents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.\nDART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment\ncluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables\nnon-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory\nsampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the\nsystem efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,\nand 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from\nabundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)\npre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement\nsparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers\nand trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on\nhigh-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning\nvia truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout\nand updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task\nsuccess rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than\nopen-source SOTA.

With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is\ngrowing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for\nreaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods\nrarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,\nlimiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we\npropose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an\nevidence-based reasoning task.

For example,\na teacher that \"likes owls\" can make its student \"like owls\" too, even when the\ntraining data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is\ncalled subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft\ndistillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token\ndistribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where\nthe student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how\ndoes subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through\ncontrolled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that\nsubliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.\nInstead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where\nteachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out\nthese tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,\ndivergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,\nfinetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal\nlearning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small\nchanges, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc99d\ub958 \uacfc\uc815 \uc911 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ud3b8\uacac\uc758 \uc804\uc774 \ud604\uc0c1, \uc989 '\ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5'\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc99d\ub958 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ud3b8\uacac\uc744 \uc804\ub2ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uacfc \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc5bd\ud798\uc774\ub098 \ub85c\uc9d3 \uc720\ucd9c \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc870\uae30 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud558\ub8e8\uc5d0 \ud55c \ubc88\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc99d\ub958 \uacfc\uc815 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ud3b8\uacac\uc744 \uc804\ub2ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, '\ubd80\uc5c9\uc774\ub97c \uc88b\uc544\ud558\ub294' \uad50\uc0ac\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc22b\uc790 \ubaa9\ub85d\uc73c\ub85c\ub9cc \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc0dd \ub610\ud55c '\ubd80\uc5c9\uc774\ub97c \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uac8c' \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 '\ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5'\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd\uc774 \uad50\uc0ac\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \ub2e4\uc74c \ud1a0\ud070 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc99d\ub958 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ub300\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud559\uc0dd\uc774 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\ub9cc \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc \uc99d\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc5b8\uc81c, \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294\uac00? \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uacfc \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 (\uc804\uc5ed) \ud1a0\ud070 \uc5bd\ud798\uc774\ub098 \ub85c\uc9d3 \uc720\ucd9c \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uc2e0, \uc774\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud3b8\uacac\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uad50\uc0ac\uac00 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc778 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ucd95\uc18c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uba74 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ud3b8\uacac \uc804\uc774\uac00 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc0ac\ub77c\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ud1a0\ud070\uc740 \ucd08\uae30 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub180\ub78d\uac8c\ub3c4, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucd08\uae30 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub9cc \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ucd09\uc9c4\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \ubcc0\ud654, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc9d5 \uac19\uc740 \uac83\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \uc774\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To promote further research and application of e-commerce\nagents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the\ne-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating\nagents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain\nrules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed\nMix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues\nwith post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process.

However, complex geographic\nenvironments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel\nconditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links\nthat severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV\nswarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV\nswarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an\nintegrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent\nenergy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed\nto optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between\nequitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy\nexpenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory\ncontrol problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions\nacross the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a\nnovel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking\n(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action\nspaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints\nin high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by\nup to 25% compared to baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 UAV \uad70\uc9d1 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\ud504\ub77c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 UAV \uad70\uc9d1 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubc0f 3D \uada4\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(MDP)\ub85c \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c UAV \uad70\ub2e8 \uac04\uc758 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uae30\uc900 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 25% \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc9c0\uc218 0.99\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c UAV \uad70\uc9d1 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV) \uad70\uc9d1 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ube44\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870, \uad70\uc0ac \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \uc791\uc804, \uc678\ub534 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uae34\uae09\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uace0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ubb34\uc120 \ucc44\ub110 \uc870\uac74\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc911-\uc9c0\uc0c1(A2G) \ub9c1\ud06c\uc758 \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \uc911\ub2e8\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 UAV \uad70\uc9d1 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c UAV \uad70\uc9d1 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

This\npaper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI\nsystems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm\ncalled Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection\nlayer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events\ncorresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to\ndynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally\nmodels the agent's emergent behavior.

However, for extremely large datasets, these\noptimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations\nrequired. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of\nclusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on\nthese systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,\nsupervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently\nidentify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting\nuser-defined precision and recall requirements.

Karabag", "David Fridovich-Keil", "Ufuk Topcu"], "title": "DiBS-MTL: Transformation-Invariant Multitask Learning with Direction Oracles", "comment": null, "summary": "Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine\ndifferent task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These\nmethods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require\naccess to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central\nchallenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled\nrelative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade\noverall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the\nDirection-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions\nimmune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task\nloss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex\nMTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under\nstandard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto\nstationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,\na computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we\nvalidate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it\nachieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while\nmaintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that\nsignificantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior\nbargaining-inspired MTL methods.

Building such\ntools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review\nliterature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,\nand implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models\n(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,\nreasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering\nnew opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing\nLLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing\ncomputational methods or on developing computational methods or models for\ngeneral machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured\nknowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an\nagentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation\nfunction and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the\napplication. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree\nrepresentation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model\ndiagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We\nconducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI\noutperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI\nagents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and\nsatellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in\ngenetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,\nincluding 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes\nand 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their\ntarget genes.

In\nparticular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically\nviable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),\nremains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart\ncontracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a\npre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum\nfirst trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to\ngas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate\ncontracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to\n35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines.

Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant\nattention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended\ninformation-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system\ncomposed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch\nmodel trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation\nthrough live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines\nthree advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent\nself-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source\ngrounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes\nmulti-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum\npruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and\n(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive\nbehavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory\nbreadth, depth, and horizon.

Recent extensions to multi-agent RL\n(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness\nto uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to\nsuboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can\npromote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,\nare typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual\nrepresentation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that\ninterprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value\nfunctions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking\nevaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem\nfor optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic\nrisk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic\nalgorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative\nbenchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves\ncoordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.\nOur framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a\ntheoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in\nMARL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

The system directly\naddresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users\nto interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,\ntranslating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to\novercome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to\ntransparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning\nframework that explains the \"why\" behind every decision, allowing for full\ninterpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business\nrules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance\nmechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:\nit enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance\nagainst golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the\ndetection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical\ndepth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations\nfrom normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative\nevidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation\nframework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The\nagent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to\nperform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and\ngenerate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach\ncreates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered\nagents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,\nPEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states\nto guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which\nnormalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device\nbattery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning.

We\nidentify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the\nsize-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail\nexhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds\nin-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse\narchitectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust\nregularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts\nare included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why\ngains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the\nbase model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive\nplanning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide\nwhen to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding\nexperts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a\ncomputationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training.

The lack of observable\nevidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is\nessential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters\noften adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which\nfurther complicates detection and detector development. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP\ncheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and\nnon-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of\nobservability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we\nformulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an\nadversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect\nrealistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that\ndynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on\ndetection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully\nsimulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward\noptimization and detection evasion.

A\nnumber of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are\nnaturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both\nrelationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation\napproaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those\ndimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by\nconsidering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We\nformulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each\ndiversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a\nmulti-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple\ndiversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is\nproposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.\ndemonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional\ndiversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a\nrange of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,\nincluding a content-based one and a player-centered one.

Retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs\nstruggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak\nmodeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model\nrelationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot\neffectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG\n(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and\nenabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc\ngraph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder\nscalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present\nG-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation\nmodels for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our\napproach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies\nheterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on\nthis, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly\ncaptures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to\nenhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and\nefficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are\nimplemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six\nbenchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency\nand

Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series\nas text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental\nchallenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process\nlong, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization\nsuffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment\nbetween the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework\nthat conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of\ndirect serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary\nhints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical\ngrounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a\npretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a\ntask-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to\nfacilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark\nfeaturing multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual\ngrounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both\nLLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of\nsignificantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy\ncompared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series\nVision Language Models.", "AI": {"tldr": "AXIS\ub294 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ud78c\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc detection \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1 \ubc1c\uc0dd \uc5ec\ubd80\uc640 \uadf8 \ud328\ud134, \uc774\uc0c1 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "AXIS\ub294 \ub3d9\uacb0\ub41c LLM\uc744 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc644 \ud78c\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AXIS\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc124\uba85\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AXIS\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0(TSAD)\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc774\uc0c1\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud588\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294\uc9c0 \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc65c \uc774\uc0c1\uc778\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c TSAD\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ub97c \ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, LLM\uc740 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud1a0\ud070\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uae34 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04-\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc9c1\ub82c\ud654\ub294 \ub450 \uc591\uc2dd \uac04\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \uae30\ucd08 \ubc0f \ud45c\ud604 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\uacb0\ub41c LLM\uc744 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ud558\ub294 AXIS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This highlights the need for clinical\nreasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing\nauditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal\nmulti-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV\nstabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate\nsteps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination\nDetector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On\nsix medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more\ncritically, demonstrates superior reliability.

Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated\npromise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to\ntraditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been\nexplored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled\nframework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general\ncontext remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a\nprincipled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for\narbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending\nprevious work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN\nlayers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup\nand provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same\nexpressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,\nallowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from\nparameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data\ntypes and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency\ncompared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain\ncases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making\nthem an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "FS-KAN\uc740 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uc21c\uc5f4 \ub300\uce6d \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc801\uc778 KA \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc21c\uc5f4 \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubc30\uacbd.", "method": "Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc801\uc778 KA \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FS-KAN\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud45c\uc900 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uc720 \uacc4\uce35\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ud615\uacfc \ub300\uce6d \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FS-KAN\uc740 KAN\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc800\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uc720 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc21c\uc5f4 \ub3d9\ub4f1 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub300\uce6d\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 MLP \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c KAN\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc21c\uc5f4 \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubd80\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uc21c\uc5f4 \ub300\uce6d \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc801\uc778 KA \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Kolmogorov-Arnold \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uc720 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c FS-KAN \uacc4\uce35\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, FS-KAN\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uc720 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2cc\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ud615\uacfc \ub300\uce6d \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, FS-KAN\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ud45c\uc900 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uc720 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, KAN\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, while most PRMs exhibit\nsubstantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific\ntraining data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization\nability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the\nlearning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling\ndomain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between\nchain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data\nannotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization\ncapabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,\nContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the\nmajority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine\nnon-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,\nsignificantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from\nother mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across\nboth mathematical and non-mathematical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 PRMs\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc911\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc8fc\uc11d \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "PRMs\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc911\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud750\ub984 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uace0, CoT \ub2e8\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc8fc\uc11d \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ContextPRM \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 MMLU-Pro\uc758 \uc544\ud649 \uac1c \ube44\uc218\ud559\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc911 \ub2e4\uc218 \uacb0\uc815 \ud22c\ud45c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 6.5%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ContextPRM\uc740 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \ube44\uc218\ud559\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70 PRMs\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378(PRMs)\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1(TTS)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 PRMs\ub294 \uc218\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ud134\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc911\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud750\ub984 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4.

Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number\nnumerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a\nchallenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints\nsuch as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state\nfeedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL\nagent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%\nvibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While\nthis level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance\nachieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is\nattributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning\nalgorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a\nhigh-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex\nshedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation.

In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model\naccurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming\nprevious world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time\ninteractive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and\nan efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general\naction conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract\nthe majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the\nchallenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning\nwith practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment\ninteraction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of\nover 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels.

However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly\nlearn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental\nmethodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe\nwhether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent\nknowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between\nembeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition\nvector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non\nlinear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically\nsignificant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines\n(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as\nopposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the\npredictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that\nthe world model emerges as training progresses.

When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an\nevident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we\npropose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can\nteach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,\nexamples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be\nable to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our\nobjective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.\nThen, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a\nlimited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most\nrepresentative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply\nour proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where\nthe agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on\nhuman examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our\nexperiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100\nexamples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.\nWe show that by providing examples in

While prior work mainly focuses\non constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to\nmitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of\nresolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present\nOrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging\northogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level\nconflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically\ndecomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that\noptimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically\nnon-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical\nguarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal\nsubspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit\nlinear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable\nconvergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:\nI. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from\n34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,\nand truthful dimensions. II.

If two or more individuals can coordinate through\ncommunication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We\ninvestigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new\nvocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals\ndo not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of\nthe interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study\ncommunication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their\nenvironment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and\nartificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations\nwhile not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always\nconverge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents\ninterpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful\nmisunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using\nmisaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination\nwith new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,\nsuccessful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair.

However,\ncurrent personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically\nrequire either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of\npre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by\nlearning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text\ngeneration. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference\nFeedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment\nwith dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the\ndecoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that\ncaptures user preferences.

However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between\nlogical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle\nto address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous\ncontexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For\nthis gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to\njointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent\nexplicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),\nwhile mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that\nincorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle\nboundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic\nsimplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce\nRepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)\nand exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior\nbenchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring\nabstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory\nrelations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical\nreasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and\ngeneralizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including\nProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%\naverage gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our\nsemiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LogicAgent\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b RepublicQA\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "LogicAgent\ub294 1\ucc28 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uba74\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \uc874\uc7ac\ub860\uc801 \uc218\uc785 \uac80\uc0ac\uc640 3\uac12 \uacb0\uc815 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\ud5c8\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 RepublicQA\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LogicAgent\ub294 RepublicQA\uc5d0\uc11c 6.25%\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \ub17c\ub9ac \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 7.05%\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 LogicAgent\uac00 LLM\uc758 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec, \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uba85\uc81c, \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \ubc0f \uc0c1\ucda9\ud558\ub294 \uc785\uc7a5\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc138\ubbf8\uc624\ud2f1 \uc2a4\ud018\uc5b4 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LogicAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, real-world\napplication is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of\npowerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query\ncosts, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple\nusers. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel\nframework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on\nmulti-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this\nproblem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)\npractically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with\ntheoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first\npropose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a\nfederated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by\nsharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to\nthe practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with\nPreference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated\ndueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and\nFedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their\nperformance consistently improves as more agents participate in the\ncollaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc785\ub825 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \ub3c5\uc810\uc131\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uc694\uad6c, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub77c\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5 \uac15\ub3c4(MAB)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\ub294 FedPOB \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "FedPOB\uc640 FedPOB-Pref\uac00 \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud560\uc218\ub85d \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c5\uc810 LLM\uc758 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \uc18d\uc131, \uc9c8\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ud544\uc694\uc131, \ub2e4\uc218 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc0ac\uc0dd\ud65c \ubcf4\ud638 \ud611\ub825 \uc695\uad6c \ub4f1 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubc29\ud574\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5 \uac15\ub3c4(MAB)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,\nprovide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal\nunderstanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing\napproaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely\nreach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose\nPhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its\narchitecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret\ndiagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform\ndual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement\nloop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic\nStudio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground\ntruth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,\nPhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:\nit consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different\nsizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)\nHistoric breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold\nmedals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in\nthe latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score\nmetric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source\nPass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406\ncontestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked\n22nd).

Currently, common time series\nforecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches\nprimarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging\nto capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional\nmethods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require\npre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed\nseasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive\nTransformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the\nlimitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining\nEMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing\nseasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale\nadaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four\nparallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,\nenhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A\ndual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately\nprocess seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function\nminimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine\ndatasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets.

Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates\nthis by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate\nsynthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world\nmodels process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects\nand temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally\ninefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly\ninfluence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we\nintroduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic\nmodulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich\nthe temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived\nfrom a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level\nmotion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic\ncategorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model\n(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments\ndemonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k\nbenchmark with a $156.6$\\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new\nrecord of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\\%\nperformance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark.

V2X cooperative perception systems are software\nsystems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying\nfusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.\nTherefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational\nchallenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous\npredictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain\ninsufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by\nconducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically\nevaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception\nperformance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in\ncooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of\nthe critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and\nidentify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation\nconfiguration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)\nVehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication\nexhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion\nschemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher\nfrequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not\nrobust against communication interference when running online. Our results\nreveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of\ncooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote\nthe design and repair of cooperative perception systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "V2X \ud611\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc624\ub958 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 V2X \ud611\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud568.", "method": "V2X \ud611\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 6\uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc624\ub958 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d.", "result": "LiDAR \uae30\ubc18 \ud611\ub3d9 \uc124\uc815\uc774 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud611\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub2e4\ub974\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud611\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd \uc624\ub958 \uc99d\uac00\uac00 \uc6b4\uc804 \uc704\ubc18 \ube48\ub3c4\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \uc5f0\uad00\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud611\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uacfc \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc5c4\uccad\ub09c \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28-\ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac83(V2X) \ud611\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc6d0\uac70\ub9ac \uac1d\uccb4 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uac00\ub824\uc9d0\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

Machine learning is increasingly being\nadopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an\nopen challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop\nrequired to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through\nexperiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a\ngiven task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large\nlanguage model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems\nwithout any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of\nphysical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer\non a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,\nand quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily\nbased on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as\nrecovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring\nHamiltonians from expectation values.

A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality\ndownstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and\nverifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human\nannotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,\nwhich is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited\ncoverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task\ngeneration that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover\npossible interactions and current state information to synthesize\nenvironment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration\nphase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment\nstates and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task\ngenerator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline\nprompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We\nshow AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks\nacross 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use\nagents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration\nsynthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and\nverifier.

Recent work has\nsought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or\nreinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit\ntask. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration\nstrategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by\ntraining LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored\nreward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,\nand an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents\noutperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper\nConfidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x\nlonger horizons and across bandit families.

We propose a different paradigm, one in\nwhich an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,\nergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language\nModel (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its\nenvironment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state\nwith no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of\ninteraction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete\ntrajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where\nit refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and\nPlaybook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable\nstrategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,\nMinesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent\nsuccessfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their\nrules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards.

However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as\nthe need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.\nTransfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these\nchallenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for\nnew, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from\nscratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage\nthe internal representations learned by the neural network during training.\nSpecifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as\nrefined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the\ninput. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used\nas input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on\nnew tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL\nmodels can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used\nwith linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a\nnovel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce\npositive correlations between feature representation of states.

This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.\nFirstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT\ntokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains\nreasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck\nacross reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with\ntoken generation, forcing LLMs to \"think while speaking,\" which causes\npotentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we\nre-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our\napproach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as\na hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional \"thoughts\". Each\nreasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit\nreasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable\nvariables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this\nlatent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we\nfurther propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on\nthree benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous\nreasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to\ntoken-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup\nin inference.

By leveraging\ntext-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene\nunderstanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.\nWe evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in navigation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 VLN \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc138\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uad00\uc810\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc720\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uba74 \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc99d\uc9c4\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "R2R \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ube44\uc720\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ub41c AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcf4\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uac01-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158(VLN) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc7a5\uba74 \uc124\uba85\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc138\ubd80 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud558\uac70\ub098, \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc218\uc900 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc720\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ube44\uc720\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uba74 \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

A key\nlimitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction\nhistory, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We\npropose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable\nreasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed\nexperiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from\nReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,\nenabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful\nexperience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling\n(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up\nthe agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,\nthe agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive\nsignals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn\nguides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory\nand test-time scaling.

The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition\nrates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,\nwhich offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,\nexisting deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental\nconditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe\nlearning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,\nprocedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single\nphysics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across\nmultiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe\ngeneralization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution\nlearning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction\nfidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even\nwhen changing the type of synthetic training object.

However,\nit suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.\nNaive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in\nthe traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of\nLRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space\nand long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion\nas the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To\naddress this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method\nthat confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN\nachieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a\ntop-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed\ninto a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical\nbenchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous\nentropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on\nAIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes\ngreater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which\nhelps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training.
