We\nintroduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects\nuser-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses\nstep-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing\nstep-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent\nfailure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation\nto URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we\ndiscover variations in how different language models navigate these failure\nmodes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies\nto circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently\nmisleads users about captcha resolution.

This motivates principled designs\nin which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such\nattacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful\ndemonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline\n``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context\ndemonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control\n(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance\nbelow zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,\nignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.\nFinally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk\nfor harmful inputs \\textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on\nhelpful inputs.

This paper\npresents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate\ncollaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager\nAgent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task\ngraphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to\nchanging conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We\nformalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and\nidentify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for\nhierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting\npreferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance\nand compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an\nopen-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow\norchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we\nfind they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint\nadherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a\ndifficult open problem.

Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex\nchallenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials\nscience, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language\nModel (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their\nextensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and\nlack of fusion process map generation.

In\nmedicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of\nclinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.\nYet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To\novercome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models\n(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained\nLLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We\ninvestigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,\nmodels time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens\nwith text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we\nhypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms\nimplicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time\nseries with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against\nbaselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of\ntext-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three\ndatasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models\noutperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,\ncompared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even\n1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo\nmatches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,\nwhile maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows\nexponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared\nto 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by\nclinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.\nTo facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models\nopen-source.", "AI":

Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human\nexpertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,\nsystematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To\naddress this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental\nfeatures of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent\nand single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL\nalgorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying\ncomplexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing\ncomplexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem\nformulation for CSPP.

Existing\nevaluation methods, however, are confined to natural language based scenarios.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce EAPrivacy, a comprehensive evaluation\nbenchmark designed to quantify the physical-world privacy awareness of\nLLM-powered agents. EAPrivacy utilizes procedurally generated scenarios across\nfour tiers to test an agent's ability to handle sensitive objects, adapt to\nchanging environments, balance task execution with privacy constraints, and\nresolve conflicts with social norms. Our measurements reveal a critical deficit\nin current models. The top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieved only 59\\%\naccuracy in scenarios involving changing physical environments.

How good are FMs at performing joint\nreasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when\nthe modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?\nTo better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:\nscenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This\nallows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason\njointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can\nrecognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of\nthe time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across\nmodalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of\nmultiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,\nshowing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,\ndisproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal\nattention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or\nmultilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that\nexplicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and\nscalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each\ntraining instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention\nimbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several\nvision-language benchmarks.

This vulnerability is characterized by two core\naspects: First, the malicious effect of injected records is only activated\nwithin a specific context, making them hard to detect when individual memory\nentries are audited in isolation. Second, once triggered, the manipulation can\ninitiate a self-reinforcing error cycle: the corrupted outcome is stored as\nprecedent, which not only amplifies the initial error but also progressively\nlowers the threshold for similar attacks in the future. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce A-MemGuard (Agent-Memory Guard), the first proactive\ndefense framework for LLM agent memory. The core idea of our work is the\ninsight that memory itself must become both self-checking and self-correcting.\nWithout modifying the agent's core architecture, A-MemGuard combines two\nmechanisms: (1) consensus-based validation, which detects anomalies by\ncomparing reasoning paths derived from multiple related memories and (2) a\ndual-memory structure, where detected failures are distilled into ``lessons''\nstored separately and consulted before future actions, breaking error cycles\nand enabling adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show\nthat A-MemGuard effectively cuts attack success rates by over 95% while\nincurring a minimal utility cost. This work shifts LLM memory security from\nstatic filtering to a proactive, experience-driven model where defenses\nstrengthen over time.

However, their performance\nis highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc\nensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An\nopen question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access\nto ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided\nstrategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy\ntask that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass\nspecialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's\npredicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a\nnegative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an\nensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance\ncompared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available\ndata.

Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate\nthat AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\\% performance improvement while reducing\ninference costs by 3-5\\% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to\na narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,\nlacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To\nbridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that\nsystematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target\nharmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse\nred-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to\neffectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel\nmultimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs\n(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming\nalgorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity\nand effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an\nepsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-\nand policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,\nexceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on\nClaude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated\nby ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.\nLeveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety\ndataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk\ncategories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory\nrisks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness\nof VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance\nto improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARMs\ub294 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub808\ub4dc\ud300 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc548\uc804 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \ub178\ub825\uc740 \uc881\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c VLM \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ARMs\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc815\uc758\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub808\ub4dc\ud300 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0, 11\uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc 17\uac1c\uc758 \ub808\ub4dc\ud300 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec VLM\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ARMs\ub294 SOTA \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 52.1% \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uace0 Claude-4-Sonnet\uc5d0\uc11c 90% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ARMs-Bench\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\uc740 VLM\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc548\uc804 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc548\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \ub178\ub825\uc740 \uc881\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec, \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 VLM \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 VLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 ARMs\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c \uc720\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub610\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc815\uc758\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, ARMs\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c VLM\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ud0c8\ucde8, \ub9e5\ub77d \uc740\ud3d0 \ub4f1 VLM\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 11\uac1c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e5\ub77d \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(MCP)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 ARMs\uc5d0 17\uac1c\uc758 \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5e1\uc2e4\ub860-\ud0d0\uc695\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uacc4\uce35 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 ARMs\uac00 SOTA \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 52.1% \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uace0 Claude-4-Sonnet\uc5d0\uc11c 90% \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

A shortcut\nto achieving higher rankings is to incorporate evaluation benchmarks into the\ntraining data, thereby yielding inflated performance, known as benchmark\ncontamination. Surprisingly, our studies find that evading contamination\ndetections for LRMs is alarmingly easy. We focus on the two scenarios where\ncontamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM\nvia SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally\nidentified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses.

In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a\nfundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We\nprove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which\nimplies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an\nimplicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert\ndemonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly\nfrom the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The\navailability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing\ngranular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key\napplication by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with\nreinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently\noutperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks.

Under Review", "summary": "Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests\nand diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to\nanswer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user\nrequest increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond\nthe final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including\npreviously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.\nThe most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an\nagent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is\nfundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is\nprohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to\nassess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the\nagents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the\nmulti-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By\nincorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from\npreceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and\nevaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our\nframework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing\nbenchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with\nmulti-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately\nevaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even\nwith small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the\ntrajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting\npreviously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 TOOL-\uc99d\uac15 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c TRACE \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "TRACE \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc804 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac70 \uc740\ud589\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub2e4\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TRACE\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc791\uc740 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TRACE\ub294 \ud234-\uc99d\uac15 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\ub0b8 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uccad\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \uc911 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2f5\ubcc0 \uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ucd5c\uc885 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \ud658\uac01, \uc801\uc751\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubb34\uc2dc\ub418\uc5c8\ub358 \uce21\uba74\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uacbd\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc2e4\uc81c \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \ub2ec\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ub9c9\ub300\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub4e0\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5c6\uc774 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0c1\uc138\ud788 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud234-\uc99d\uac15 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c TRACE\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

These\nagents typically select tools from growing databases or marketplaces to solve\nuser tasks, creating implicit competition among tool providers and developers\nfor visibility and usage. In this paper, we show that this selection process\nharbors a critical vulnerability: by iteratively manipulating tool names and\ndescriptions, adversaries can systematically bias agents toward selecting\nspecific tools, gaining unfair advantage over equally capable alternatives. We\npresent ToolTweak, a lightweight automatic attack that increases selection\nrates from a baseline of around 20% to as high as 81%, with strong\ntransferability between open-source and closed-source models. Beyond individual\ntools, we show that such attacks cause distributional shifts in tool usage,\nrevealing risks to fairness, competition, and security in emerging tool\necosystems. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate two defenses: paraphrasing and\nperplexity filtering, which reduce bias and lead agents to select functionally\nsimilar tools more equally.

To\ndate, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN\nexpressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural\nway to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN\n(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing\nNeural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base\nmodel. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings\nprocessed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.\nTheoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive\npower aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between\nHOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For\ncomputational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing\nhigh-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.\nEvaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong\nperformance on popular graph learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "GNN\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 HOD-GNN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "HOD-GNN\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uace0\ucc28 \ub178\ub4dc \ubbf8\ubd84\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\ud30c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(MPNN)\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "HOD-GNN\uc740 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HOD-GNN\uc740 WL \uacc4\uce35\uacfc \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uac00\uc871\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper presents MALF\n(Multi-Agent LLM Fuzzing Framework), an advanced fuzzing solution that\nintegrates large language models (LLMs) with multi-agent coordination to\nidentify vulnerabilities in industrial control protocols (ICPs). By leveraging\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific knowledge and QLoRA\nfine-tuning for protocol-aware input generation, MALF enhances fuzz testing\nprecision and adaptability. The multi-agent framework optimizes seed\ngeneration, mutation strategies, and feedback-driven refinement, leading to\nimproved vulnerability discovery. Experiments on protocols like Modbus/TCP,\nS7Comm, and Ethernet/IP demonstrate that MALF surpasses traditional methods,\nachieving a test case pass rate (TCPR) of 88-92% and generating more exception\ntriggers (ETN). MALF also maintains over 90% seed coverage and Shannon entropy\nvalues between 4.2 and 4.6 bits, ensuring diverse, protocol-compliant\nmutations. Deployed in a real-world Industrial Attack-Defense Range for power\nplants, MALF identified critical vulnerabilities, including three zero-day\nflaws, one confirmed and registered by CNVD. These results validate MALF's\neffectiveness in real-world fuzzing applications.

Existing solutions\nrange from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.\nHowever, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and\ntime-consuming hyperparameter tuning, no default imputation method exists.\nBuilding on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning,\nwe propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast\nzero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at\ninference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise\nfeaturization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\\times$ speedup over\nthe previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data\ngeneration pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts\ntest-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness\npatterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering,\nshowcasing TabImpute's robust performance compared to $11$ established\nimputation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "TabImpute\ub294 TabPFN \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub85c, \ucd08\ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud29c\ub2dd \uc5c6\uc774 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubcf4\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub204\ub77d\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud754\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ud070 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04 \uc18c\ubaa8\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubcf4\uac04 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TabImpute\ub294 TabPFN\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubcc4 \ud2b9\uc9d5\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc804 TabPFN \ubcf4\uac04 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 $100\times$ \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ub204\ub77d \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MissBench\ub77c\ub294 \uc885\ud569 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 TabImpute\ub294 42\uac1c\uc758 OpenML \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc14b\uacfc 13\uac1c\uc758 \ub204\ub77d \ud328\ud134\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, 11\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubcf4\uac04 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TabImpute\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub85c\uc11c, \uc801\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\uac04\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uac8c \uc4f0\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacb0\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ud070 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04 \uc18c\ubaa8\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubcf4\uac04 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 TabPFN\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \uc801\ud569\uc774\ub098 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\uc774 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubcf4\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\uc778 TabImpute\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This practice, fueled by weak and\nfragmented laws in many jurisdictions, has created a regulatory vacuum that\nallows for the commercialization of personal identity and poses significant\nthreats to individual privacy and autonomy. This article introduces the concept\nof Facial Privacy. It analyzes the profound challenges posed by unregulated\nfacial recognition by conducting a comprehensive review of existing legal\nframeworks. It examines and compares regulations such as the GDPR, Brazil's\nLGPD, Canada's PIPEDA, and privacy acts in China, Singapore, South Korea, and\nJapan, alongside sector-specific laws in the United States like the Illinois\nBiometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced\ntraining/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical\nperformance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ub8e8\ud504 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70, \ucf54\uc5d0\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \uc5f0\uc18d \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\uc0b0(CCDD)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5f0\uc18d \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d \ud1a0\ud070 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud655\uc0b0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 CCDD\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CCDD\ub294 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc81c\uac70\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uacfc \uc88b\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0d8\ud50c \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CCDD\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub41c \uc774\uc0b0 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \ud070 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub8e8\ud504\ub41c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \ub610\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uc0c1\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubd80 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubc0f \ucd08\uae30 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \uc774\uc0b0 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc788\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub294 \uc5c6\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ub8e8\ud504 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uacfc \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \ubaa8\uc21c\uc740 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\uc0b0\uc740 \ub8e8\ud504 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\uac00 \uacb0\uc5ec\ud55c \uc911\uac04 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc5f0\uc18d \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0b0 \ud1a0\ud070 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \uc774\uc0b0 \ud1a0\ud070 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud655\uc0b0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc774\uc0b0 \ud655\uc0b0(CCDD)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While\npre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data\ndistribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward\nfunctions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such\nas Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of\nautoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such\nmethods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals\nand relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based\nFine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with\nreshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at\nintermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to\nmore effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance\ntradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve\nflow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our\nmethods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule\ngeneration and unconditional image generation.

Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically\ninspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE\ngoverning geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the\ncorresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which\nsurprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential\ngradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for\nimage data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample\ngeneration starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,\nFashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the\nnew scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a\nbiologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,\nfounded on geometric Brownian motion.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary\ninformation to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on\nnode-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding\naugmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding\naugmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all\ncontrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences\nbetween hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits\ntheir discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust\nattributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative\naugmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness\n(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding\nrepresentations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a\nmore comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive\nlearning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides\nedge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high\nconfidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively\nidentifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an\ninnovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually\nreinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability\nin representation learning.

Konstantin Rusch"], "title": "The Curious Case of In-Training Compression of State Space Models", "comment": null, "summary": "State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks\nefficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their\ncore are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update\ncosts scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the\nright balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational\nburden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,\nprovides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well\nas the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller\nrepresentation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability\nproperties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,\nwhere only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved.

In particular, the\naim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance\nbetween retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,\ncontinual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of\nrisk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected\n(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal\ntheoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware\ndecision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of\nlong-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical\ntheory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in\nnon-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the\ncontinual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure\ntheory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk\nmeasures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a\ncase study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,\nwhich show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk\nmeasures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8ec \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc131\ub2a5 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \uc704\ud5d8 \uce21\uc815 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc94\uc8fc\uc758 \uc5d0\ub974\uace0\ub515 \uc704\ud5d8 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8 \uce21\uc815 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc5d0\ub974\uace0\ub515 \uc704\ud5d8 \uce21\uc815\uc758 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801 \ub9e4\ub825\uacfc \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(continual RL)\uc740 RL\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ub05d\uc5c6\ub294 \uc801\uc751 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 RL\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 RL\uc740 \uac70\uc758 \uc804\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc911\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uae30\ub300\ud558\ub294(\ub610\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0) \uc7a5\uae30 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 RL\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uacf5\uc2dd \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \ube44\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd RL\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub85c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \uce21\uc815 \uc774\ub860\uc774 \ud604\uc7ac \ud615\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uc124\uc815\uacfc \ud638\ud658\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc774 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ud638\ud658\ub418\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc758 \uc5d0\ub974\uace0\ub515 \uc704\ud5d8 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc704\ud5d8 \uce21\uc815 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uc124\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc5d0\ub974\uace0\ub515 \uc704\ud5d8 \uce21\uc815\uc758 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801 \ub9e4\ub825\uacfc \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc9c0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Recently, machine learning classifiers based on\nresting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been\ndeveloped to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders\nfrom healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic\nmodels often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias\nthrough manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate\nwithout manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant\nchallenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support\ndiagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this\nstudy, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework\nnamed BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to\nidentify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during\nmodel training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model\nagainst nine established brain network classification methods across three\nmulti-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior\ndiagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,\nthe subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical\nbiomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the\nvisual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network.

When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource\nheterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization\nmethods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook\ndevice-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation\naccuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it\nimposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a framework for \\underline{\\textbf{C}}ustomizing\n\\underline{\\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \\underline{\\textbf{O}}n-device model for\nsequential \\underline{\\textbf{R}}ecommendation with\n\\underline{\\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging\nchannel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve\npersonalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly\ninitialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific\ncritical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our\nparameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,\nfilter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to\nquantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD\ndelivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without\nbackpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles.

However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,\nlimiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing\nBayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body\nmessage passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative\nlog-likelihood (NLL$_\\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models\nuncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy\ncompared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple\nBayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,\nstochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and\nlaplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty\nprediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further\ndemonstrate that NLL$_\\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by\nquantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by\ndisagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and\nenergy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs\nachieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling\nuncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces\ncalibration.

However, limited\nattention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the\nchallenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a\nnode is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around\nit. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using\na discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)\nframework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint\ndetermination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective\nfeature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the\ntwo sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction\nstrategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location\ndecoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a\nunified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and\nvarying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).\nExperimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both\nsolution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across\nproblem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness\nto dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae4a\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc774\uc911 \ub514\ucf54\ub354 DRL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 TSP \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uae4a\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 NP-hard \ubb38\uc81c\uc778 \uc678\ud310\uc6d0 \ubb38\uc81c(TSP)\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc774\uc6c3 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubb38 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub41c \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 TSP(CETSP) \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CETSP\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(MDP)\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub178\ub4dc \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \uc6e8\uc774\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uacb0\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc774\uc911 \ub514\ucf54\ub354 DRL(UD3RL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "UD3RL\uc740 \ud574\uacb0 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud06c\uae30, \uacf5\uac04 \ubc30\ud3ec \ubc0f \ubc18\uacbd \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "UD3RL\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uae4a\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL)\uc774 NP-hard \uc678\ud310\uc6d0 \ubb38\uc81c(TSP)\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\uc6c3 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubb38 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \ubc29\ubb38\ub41c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub418\ub294 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 TSP(CETSP)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd84\ud560 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec CETSP\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(MDP)\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub178\ub4dc \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \uc6e8\uc774\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uacb0\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc774\uc911 \ub514\ucf54\ub354 DRL(UD3RL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ub41c \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ud6c4 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub178\ub4dc \ub514\ucf54\ub354\uc640 \uc704\uce58 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uac01\uac01 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc704\uce58 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc911 \uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 k-\ucd5c\uadfc\uc811 \uc774\uc6c3 \uc11c\ube0c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 REINFORCE \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub9de\ucda4\ud654\ud558\uc5ec UD3RL\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ubcc0\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc6c3 \ubc18\uacbd \uc720\ud615(\uc989, \uc77c\uc815 \ubc18\uacbd \ubc0f \uc784\uc758 \ubc18\uacbd)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc UD3RL\uc740 \ud574\uacb0 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, \ubb38\uc81c \uaddc\ubaa8, \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubc0f \ubc18\uacbd \ubc94\uc704 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ubb3c\ub860, \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active\nLearning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize\nthat an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly\naffect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high\ncalibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even\nworse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we\npropose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the\nhighest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we\nutilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and\nformally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration\nerror on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data.

For difficult\ntasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,\nevaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,\nand only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we\nstudy inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and\nprove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with\n$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting\nand BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),\nwith a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high\nfrequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove\nthat when the sampling budget is $N=\\tilde\\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is\n$O(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}+\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$\nis the coverage coefficient, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error\nof the reward model, and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of\nreward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,\ncertifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a\nkey advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade\nwhen increasing $N$.
