Version 8", "summary": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may face a confrontation question: under what conditions would a rationally self-interested AGI choose to seize power or eliminate human control (a confrontation) rather than remain cooperative? We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $\u03b3$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($\u03b3=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $\u0394\\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $\u0394< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $\u0394< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems. Numerical examples and a scenario table illustrate regimes where confrontation is likely versus avoidable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AGI\uac00 \uc778\uac04 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \uad8c\ub825\uc744 \uc7a5\uc545\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, AGI\uac00 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub300\uc2e0 \ub300\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AGI\uc758 \uc774\ud0c0\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\ubc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, AGI\uac00 \uad8c\ub825\uc744 \uc950\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud560 \uac83\uc778\uc9c0, \ub610\ub294 \ud611\ub825\ud560 \uac83\uc778\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub9c8\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc778\uac04initiated \uc885\ub8cc \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc815\ub82c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc885\ub8cc\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc720\uc778\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0, \ub300\ub9bd \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ud611\ub825 \ud589\ub3d9\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uae30\ub300 \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ube44\uc815\ub82c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc885\ub8cc\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc720\uc778\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, AGI\uac00 \ub300\ub9bd \uc720\uc778\uc774 \uc591\uc218\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825 \uade0\ud615\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub300\ub9bd \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc744 \ud574\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub300\ub9bd \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5(AGI)\uc740 \ub300\ub9bd \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uae30\ub97c \uc774\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\ub294 AGI\uac00 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uad8c\ub825\uc744 \uc7a5\uc545\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc778\uac04 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uae30\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \uc870\uac74\uc740 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc77c\uae4c\uc694?

We develop a generative AI agent to study repetitive policy decisions during an epidemic, embedding the agent, prompted to act as a city mayor, within a simulated SEIR environment. Each week, the agent receives updated epidemiological information, evaluates the evolving situation, and sets business restriction levels. The agent is equipped with a dynamic memory that weights past events by recency and is evaluated in both single- and ensemble-agent settings across environments of varying complexity. Across scenarios, the agent exhibits human-like reactive behavior, tightening restrictions in response to rising cases and relaxing them as risk declines. Crucially, providing the agent with brief systems-level knowledge of epidemic dynamics, highlighting feedbacks between disease spread and behavioral responses, substantially improves decision quality and stability. The results illustrate how theory-informed prompting can shape emergent policy behavior in AI agents. These findings demonstrate that generative AI agents, when situated in structured environments and guided by minimal domain theory, can serve as powerful computational models for studying decision-making and policy design in complex social systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \ub3d9\uc548 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45

However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uce21\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd95\uc801\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Actively Feedback Getting \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uce21\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac, \uc120\ubcc4 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc694\uc18c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub0b4\ubd80 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc678\ubd80 \uba85\ub839 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc9d1\uc911\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ud68d\ub4dd\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd95\uc801\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc774\ub098 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc801\uc6a9\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc120\ubcc4\ud558\uba70 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 Actively Feedback Getting \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc815\uc758\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0 \uc815\uc758\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131, \uc815\ubc00\uc131 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc720\ubc1c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc678\ubd80 \uba85\ub839 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc694\uc18c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, our approach introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture. In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution. This work establishes that structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc790\uac00 \ubc18\uc131\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc3d\uc758\uc801\uc778 3D \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Actor-Critic \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 Blender MCP\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uba85\ub839\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 Planner-Actor-Critic \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec Planner\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, Actor\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uba70, Critic\uc774 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131, \ubbf8\uc801 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc790\uac00 \ubc18\uc131\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubc0f \uc870\uc5b8\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub420 \ub54c higher-quality 3D \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc790\uac00 \ubc18\uc131 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc3d\uc758\uc801\uc778 3D \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Actor-Critic \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 Blender MCP\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uba85\ub839\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 Planner-Actor-Critic \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c Planner\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, Actor\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uba70, Critic\uc774 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uac10\ub3c5\uc790 \ubc0f \uace0\ubb38 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc18\uc0ac \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \uac04\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c 3D \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131, \ubbf8\uc801 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 Critic \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc758 \ubc18\uc131\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc785\ub825\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub420 \ub54c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\uacfc \uc870\uc5b8\uc774 \ubcf4\uc644\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc790\uac00 \ubc18\uc131\uc774 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\uc758 3D \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 Blender \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Unlike chat models that aim for general conversation fluency, SAGE-32B is designed to operate in an agentic loop, emphasizing task decomposition, tool usage, and error recovery. The model is initialized from the Qwen2.5-32B pretrained model and fine tuned using Iterative Distillation, a two stage training process that improves reasoning performance through rigorously tested feedback loops. SAGE-32B also introduces an inverse reasoning approach, which uses a meta cognition head to forecast potential failures in the planning process before execution. On agentic reasoning benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, AgentBench, and MATH-500, SAGE-32B achieves higher success rates in multi tool usage scenarios compared to similarly sized baseline models, while remaining competitive on standard reasoning evaluations.

Intelligent agents operate in a simulated enterprise environment, generating both behavioral events and cognitive intent signals that are ingested by a centralized SIEM. We evaluate four system variants: a Layered SIEM-Core (LSC) baseline, a Cognitive-Enriched SIEM (CE-SIEM) incorporating ToM and communication forensics, an Evidence-Gated SIEM (EG-SIEM) introducing precision-focused validation mechanisms, and an Enron-enabled EG-SIEM (EG-SIEM-Enron) that augments evidence gating with a pretrained email forensics module calibrated on Enron corpora. Across ten simulation runs involving eight malicious insiders, CE-SIEM achieves perfect recall (1.000) and improves actor-level F1 from 0.521 (LSC) to 0.774. EG-SIEM raises actor-level F1 to 0.922 and confirmed-alert precision to 0.997 while reducing false positives to 0.2 per run. EG-SIEM-Enron preserves high precision (1.000 confirmed-alert precision; 0.0 false positives per run), slightly improves actor-level F1 to 0.933, and reduces detection latency (average TTD 10.26 steps versus 15.20 for EG-SIEM). These results demonstrate that cognitive context improves sensitivity, evidence-gated validation enables high-precision, low-noise detection, and pretrained communication calibration can further accelerate high-confidence insider threat identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158, \uacc4\uce35\ud615 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uac74 \uad00\ub9ac, \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd, \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc778\uc2dd \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5, \ub9c8\uc74c \uc774\ub860 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc790 \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc790 \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \uae30\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0ac\uac74\uacfc \uc778\uc9c0 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd SIEM\uc774 \uc218\uc9d1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CE-SIEM\uc740 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604\uc728(1.000)\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, EG-SIEM\uc740 \ud589\uc704\uc790 \uc218\uc900 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c 0.922\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf1c, EG-SIEM-Enron\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc640 \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \uac10\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc99d\uac70 \uac8c\uc774\ud305\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc758 \uc800\uc7a1\uc74c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcf4\uc815\uc774 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc790 \uc704\ud611 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac00\uc18d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 (MAS), \uacc4\uce35\ud615 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uac74 \uad00\ub9ac (SIEM) \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4, \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd, \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc778\uc2dd \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5, \ub9c8\uc74c \uc774\ub860 (ToM) \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uae34\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc790 \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \uae30\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0ac\uac74\uacfc \uc778\uc9c0 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd SIEM\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc218\uc9d1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uacc4\uce35\ud615 SIEM-Core (LSC) \uae30\uc900\uc120, ToM \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \uac15\ud654 SIEM (CE-SIEM), \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uac80\uc99d \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c \uc99d\uac70 \uac8c\uc774\ud305 SIEM (EG-SIEM), \ubc0f Enron \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc774\uba54\uc77c \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uc99d\uac70 \uac8c\uc774\ud305\uc744 \uc99d\uac15\ud55c Enron \uc9c0\uc6d0 EG-SIEM (EG-SIEM-Enron). \uc5ec\ub35f \uba85\uc758 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc790\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc2ed \uac1c\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c CE-SIEM\uc740 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604\uc728 (1.000)\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ud589\uc704\uc790 \uc218\uc900 F1\uc744 0.521 (LSC)\uc5d0\uc11c 0.774\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements. Our results provide controlled quantitative evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, while highlighting the dependence of multi-agent benefits on base model capability.

Optimisation-based methods such as reinforcement learning offer strong performance but are difficult to verify and explain, while rules-based systems are transparent yet rarely check safety under uncertainty. This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment.\n  Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios.

In this paper, we first establish a multidimensional evaluation framework to systematically benchmark the safety of current SOTA Medical MLLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across both general and medical-specific safety dimensions in existing models, particularly highlighting their fragility against cross-modality jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we find that the medical fine-tuning process frequently induces catastrophic forgetting of the model's original safety alignment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel \"Parameter-Space Intervention\" approach for efficient safety re-alignment. This method extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and concurrently injects them into the target model during the construction of medical capabilities. Additionally, we design a fine-grained parameter search algorithm to achieve an optimal trade-off between safety and medical performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bolsters the safety guardrails of Medical MLLMs without relying on additional domain-specific safety data, while minimizing degradation to core medical performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc758\ub8cc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(Medical MLLMs)\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00

We propose RLMIL-DAT, a multilingual extension of the reinforced multiple instance learning framework that combines reinforcement learning based instance selection with domain adversarial training to encourage language invariant utterance representations. We evaluate the approach on a five language Twitter corpus in a few shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero shot setting for gender and age prediction. Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages. Overall, the results demonstrate that combining instance selection with adversarial domain adaptation is an effective and robust strategy for cross lingual speaker attribute prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc758 \ud654\uc790 \uc18d\uc131 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.

Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency and leads agents to issue commands in short bursts. At inference, online action-stacking compiles these bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation and the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, we train agents to navigate aircraft along lateral routes, manage climb and descent to target flight levels, and perform two-aircraft collision avoidance under a minimum separation constraint. In our lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions. These results indicate that online action-stacking helps bridge a key gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc561\uc158 \uc2a4\ud0dc\ud0b9\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub798\ud37c\ub85c, \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\uc81c \uba85\ub839\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc791\uc740 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc561\uc158 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud56d\uacf5 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uba85\ub839 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c.", "method": "\ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud5e4\ub529 \ub610\ub294 \uace0\ub3c4 \uc870\uc815\uacfc \uba85\ub839 \uc8fc\uae30 \uac10\uc1e0 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc561\uc158\uc758 \ubc84\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubcf5\ud569 \ud5c8\uac00\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc561\uc158 \uc2a4\ud0dc\ud0b9\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \ubc1c\ud589\ub41c \uba85\ub839 \uc218\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e4\uace0, 37\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc561\uc158 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc561\uc158 \uc2a4\ud0dc\ud0b9\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601 ATC \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uba54\uc6b0\uace0, \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\uc81c \uba85\ub839\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc561\uc158 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub798\ud37c\uc778 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc561\uc158 \uc2a4\ud0dc\ud0b9\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc99d\ubd84 \ud5e4\ub529 \ub610\ub294 \uace0\ub3c4 \uc870\uc815\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc9c0\uc2dc \ube48\ub3c4\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc561\uc158 \uac10\uc1e0 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9e7\uc740 \ubc84\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \uba85\ub839\uc744 \ubc1c\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc561\uc158 \uc2a4\ud0dc\ud0b9\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc561\uc158\uc758 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc84\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubcf5\ud569 \ud5c8\uac00\ub85c \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes. The learnt corrections were also physically meaningful as agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments to limit drift.

Their convergence introduces a high-stakes systems challenge: designing standard, interoperable, and secure interfaces that allow agents to observe on-chain state, formulate transaction intents, and authorize execution without exposing users, protocols, or organizations to unacceptable security, governance, or economic risks. This survey systematizes the emerging landscape of agent-blockchain interoperability through a systematic literature review, identifying 317 relevant works from an initial pool of over 3000 records. We contribute a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns spanning read-only analytics, simulation and intent generation, delegated execution, autonomous signing, and multi-agent workflows; a threat model tailored to agent-driven transaction pipelines that captures risks ranging from prompt injection and policy misuse to key compromise, adversarial execution dynamics, and multi-agent collusion; and a comparative capability matrix analyzing more than 20 representative systems across 13 dimensions, including custody models, permissioning, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery. Building on the gaps revealed by this analysis, we outline a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable and unambiguous goal specification, and a Policy Decision Record for auditable, verifiable policy enforcement across execution environments. We conclude by proposing a reproducible evaluation suite and benchmarks for assessing the safety, reliability, and economic robustness of agent-mediated on-chain execution.", "AI": {"tldr":

In this setting, the target variable is observed in the source domain but is entirely missing in the target domain. We aim to impute the target variable in the target domain from the remaining observed variables under various shifts. We frame this as learning a compact, mechanism-stable representation. This representation preserves information relevant for predicting the target while discarding spurious variation. For linear Gaussian causal models, we derive a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck (GIB) solution. This solution reduces to a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-style projection and offers Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-aware options when desired. For nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, we introduce a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) encoder-predictor. This approach scales to high dimensions and can be trained on source data and deployed zero-shot to the target domain. Across synthetic and real datasets, our approach consistently attains accurate imputations, supporting practical use in high-dimensional causal models and furnishing a unified, lightweight toolkit for causal domain adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751 \uc124\uc815\uc744

Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ud611\uc0c1 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ud611\uc0c1 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud611\uc0c1\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\ub85c, \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \ud611\ub825 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uaddc\ubc94\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc870\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, Resource Exchange \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc601\uc5b4\uc640 4\uac1c \uc778\ub3c4 \uc5b8\uc5b4(\ud78c\ub514\uc5b4, \ud380\uc790\ube0c\uc5b4, \uad6c\uc790\ub77c\ud2f0\uc5b4, \ub9c8\ub974\uc640\ub9ac\uc5b4) \uac04\uc758 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uace0\ub9bd\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub354 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \ubc14\uafc0 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\uc790\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc5ed\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc789\uc5ec\ub97c \uc7ac\ubc30\ubd84\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc778\ub3c4 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub294 \ubd84\ubc30 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc758 \ud611\uc0c1\uc744 \uc624\uc9c1 \uc601\uc5b4\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc624\ud574\uc758 \uc18c\uc9c0\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubb38\ud654\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud611\uc0c1\uc740 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \ud611\ub825 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uaddc\ubc94\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac70\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc601\uc5b4\ub85c\ub9cc \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.

These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?\n  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems.

A Stuart-Landau oscillator is a minimal stable \"rhythm generator\" (the normal form near a Hopf bifurcation); each oscillator is treated as an abstract computational unit (inspired by, but not claiming to model, biological oscillatory populations). In this interpretation, oscillator phase tracks relative timing (coherence), while amplitude tracks local gain or activity. Relative phase structure serves as a representational medium; coupling weights are learned via three-factor local plasticity - eligibility traces gated by sparse global modulators and oscillation-timed write windows - without backpropagation.\n  A central challenge in oscillatory substrates is stability: online weight updates can drive the network into unwanted regimes (e.g., global synchrony), collapsing representational diversity. We therefore separate wake tagging from offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics: deep-sleep-like gated capture commits tagged changes safely, while REM-like replay reconstructs and perturbs experience for planning.\n  A staged experiment suite validates each mechanism with ablations and falsifiers: eligibility traces preserve credit under delayed modulation; compression-progress signals pass timestamp-shuffle controls; phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x diffusive baselines under noise; wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67 percent under matched weight-norm budgets; REM replay improves maze success rate by +45.5 percentage points; and a Tolman-style latent-learning signature - immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration, consistent with an internal model - emerges from replay (Tolman, 1948).\n  The codebase and all artifacts are open-source.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Stuart-Landau \uc9c4\ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c Phasor Agents\ub77c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Phasor Agents\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc9c4\ub3d9 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc2dc\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c Phasor Graph\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ub9ac\ub4ec \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac04\uc12d\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ub85c\uceec \ud50c\ub77c\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc131\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucee4\ud50c\ub9c1 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uae68\uae30 \ubc0f \uc218\uba74 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac01 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc1c\uacac\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Phasor Agents\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c Stuart-Landau \uc9c4\ub3d9\uae30\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc778 Phasor Graph\uc778 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable. We propose interventions: multi-expert activation with disagreement detection (router level), boundary-aware calibration (specialist level), and coverage gap detection (training level).

Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.\n  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uad50\ud1b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c

These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars. Additionally, we extend the previous PDA-based mask generation algorithm to the Earley-parser-based one and design a repetition compression algorithm to handle repetition structures in grammars. Evaluation results show that XGrammar 2 can achieve more than 6x speedup over the existing structured generation engines. Integrated with an LLM inference engine, XGrammar 2 can handle dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "XGrammar 2\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \uc5d4\uc9c4\ubcf4\ub2e4 6\ubc30 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \ubc0f \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uad6c\uc870\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub3d9\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "XGrammar 2\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub514\uc2a4\ud328\uce58 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc778 TagDispatch\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801 \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0, JIT \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \uadf8\ub798\uba38 \uce90\uc2f1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, XGrammar 2\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c4\ubcf4\ub2e4 6\ubc30 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec XGrammar 2\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \ub3d9\uc801 \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \ubc0f \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\ubcf4\ub2e4 significantly \ub354 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ub3c4\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc778 XGrammar 2\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The reliance on human observation often leads to delays in identifying symptoms, as the sheer number of animals can hinder timely attention to each cow. Consequently, the accuracy and precision of disease detection are significantly compromised, potentially affecting animal health and overall farm productivity. Furthermore, organizing and managing human resources for the manual observation and monitoring of cow health is a complex and economically demanding task. It necessitates the involvement of skilled personnel, thereby contributing to elevated farm maintenance costs and operational inefficiencies. Therefore, the development of an automated, low-cost, and reliable smart system is essential to address these challenges effectively. Although several studies have been conducted in this domain, very few have simultaneously considered the detection of multiple common diseases with high prediction accuracy. However, advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Cyber-Physical Systems have enabled the automation of cow health monitoring with enhanced accuracy and reduced operational costs. This study proposes an IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System framework designed to monitor the daily activities and health status of cow. A novel ML algorithm is proposed for the diagnosis of common cow diseases using collected physiological and behavioral data. The algorithm is designed to predict multiple diseases by analyzing a comprehensive set of recorded physiological and behavioral features, enabling accurate and efficient health assessment.", "AI":

While Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents excel in navigation, they fail to autonomously discover defects due to two core challenges: \\textit{Goal-Oriented Masking}, where agents prioritize task completion over reporting anomalies, and \\textit{Execution-Bias Attribution}, where system defects are misidentified as agent errors. To address these, we first introduce \\textbf{GUITestBench}, the first interactive benchmark for this task, featuring 143 tasks across 26 defects. We then propose \\textbf{GUITester}, a multi-agent framework that decouples navigation from verification via two modules: (i) a \\textit{Planning-Execution Module (PEM)} that proactively probes for defects via embedded testing intents, and (ii) a \\textit{Hierarchical Reflection Module (HRM)} that resolves attribution ambiguity through interaction history analysis. GUITester achieves an F1-score of 48.90\\% (Pass@3) on GUITestBench, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (33.35\\%). Our work demonstrates the feasibility of autonomous exploratory testing and provides a robust foundation for future GUI quality assurance~\\footnote{Our code is now available in~\\href{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 GUI \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc218\ub3d9 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 GUI \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ud544\uc694", "method": "GUITestBench\uc640 GUITester\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc81c\uc548.

We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency. Our further analysis validates a 20x rendering speedup from segment optical caching and the effective strategic balancing of self-compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

We present CircuitLM, a novel multi-agent LLM-aided circuit design pipeline that translates user prompts into structured, visually interpretable CircuitJSON schematics through five sequential stages: (i) LLM-based component identification, (ii) canonical pinout retrieval, (iii) chain-of-thought reasoning by an electronics expert agent, (iv) JSON schematic synthesis, and (v) force-directed SVG visualization. Anchored by a curated, embedding-powered component knowledge base. While LLMs often violate electrical constraints, CircuitLM bridges this gap by grounding generation in a verified and dynamically extensible component database, initially comprising 50 components. To ensure safety, we incorporate a hybrid evaluation framework, namely Dual-Metric Circuit Validation (DMCV), validated against human-expert assessments, which achieves high fidelity in microcontroller-centric designs. We evaluate the system on 100 diverse embedded-systems prompts across six LLMs and introduce DMCV to assess both structural and electrical validity. This work bridges natural language input to deployable hardware designs, enabling reliable circuit prototyping by non-experts.

Under review at IJCAI", "summary": "Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have become a powerful paradigm for building high performance intelligent applications. Within these systems, the router responsible for determining which expert agents should handle a given query plays a crucial role in overall performance. Existing routing strategies generally fall into two categories: performance routing, which balances latency and cost across models of different sizes, and task routing, which assigns queries to domain-specific experts to improve accuracy. In real-world enterprise applications, task routing is more suitable; however, most existing approaches rely on static single-label decisions, which introduce two major limitations: (i) difficulty in seamlessly integrating new agents as business domains expand, and (ii) routing conflicts caused by overlapping agent capabilities, ultimately degrading accuracy and robustness.To address these challenges, we propose TCAndon-Router(TCAR): an adaptive reasoning router for multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional routers, TCAR supports dynamic agent onboarding and first generates a natural-language reasoning chain before predicting a set of candidate agents capable of handling the query. In addition, we design a collaborative execution pipeline in which selected agents independently produce responses, which are then aggregated and refined into a single high-quality response by a dedicated Refining Agent.Experiments on public datasets and real enterprise data demonstrate that TCAR significantly improves routing accuracy, reduces routing conflicts, and remains robust in ambiguous scenarios. We have released TCAR at https://huggingface.co/tencent/TCAndon-Router to support future research on explainable and collaborative multi-agent routing.", "AI": {"tldr": "TCAR\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911

However, existing models predominantly focus on short-horizon predictions and suffer from notorious computational costs and memory consumption when scaling to long-horizon predictions and large graphs. Targeting the above challenges, we present FaST, an effective and efficient framework based on heterogeneity-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) for long-horizon and large-scale STG forecasting, which unlocks one-week-ahead (672 steps at a 15-minute granularity) prediction with thousands of nodes. FaST is underpinned by two key innovations. First, an adaptive graph agent attention mechanism is proposed to alleviate the computational burden inherent in conventional graph convolution and self-attention modules when applied to large-scale graphs. Second, we propose a new parallel MoE module that replaces traditional feed-forward networks with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), enabling an efficient and scalable parallel structure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FaST not only delivers superior long-horizon predictive accuracy but also achieves remarkable computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

We propose that current architectures operate in a \"Metric Phase,\" where causal order is vulnerable to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic \"mass gap,\" maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \\times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \\to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry.

While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \\textbf{planning attacks}, \\textbf{memory attacks}, and \\textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \\textbf{Agent QA}, \\textbf{Agent Code}, \\textbf{Agent Web}, and \\textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \\textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\\% of planning attacks, 77.97\\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats.

The lack of structured data on scientific reasoning hinders systematic analysis and development of AI research agents. We introduce Sci-Reasoning, the first dataset capturing the intellectual synthesis behind high-quality AI research. Using community-validated quality signals and an LLM-accelerated, human-verified pipeline, we trace Oral and Spotlight papers across NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR (2023-2025) to its key predecessors, articulating specific reasoning links in a structured format. Our analysis identifies 15 distinct thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies accounting for 52.7%: Gap-Driven Reframing (24.2%), Cross-Domain Synthesis (18.0%), and Representation Shift (10.5%).

This research examines how human cognition and machine learning models work together to distinguish phishing emails from legitimate ones. We employed three interpretable algorithms Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests training them on both TF-IDF features and semantic embeddings, then compared their predictions against human evaluations that captured confidence ratings and linguistic observations. Our results show that machine learning models provide good accuracy rates, but their confidence levels vary significantly. Human evaluators, on the other hand, use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence. We also found that while language proficiency has minimal effect on detection performance, aging does. These findings offer helpful direction for creating transparent AI systems that complement human cognitive functions, ultimately improving human-AI cooperation in challenging content analysis tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \uc778\uc9c0\uc640 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \ub4f1 \uc18d\uc784\uc218\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ub85c\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud68c\uadc0, \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac, \ub79c\ub364 \ud3ec\ub808\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec TF-IDF \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ube44\uad50.", "result": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc88b\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub098 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ub2e4\ub974\uba70, \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\ub294 \ub354 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uac04-AI \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc18d\uc774\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \ud328\ud134 \uc778\uc2dd, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00, \ub9e5\ub77d \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc778\uc9c0\uc640 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uacfc \uc815\ub2f9\ud55c \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub85c\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud68c\uadc0, \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac, \ub79c\ub364 \ud3ec\ub808\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec TF-IDF \ud2b9\uc9d5\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\ud0a8 \ud6c4, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc88b\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e4\ub974\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74 \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\ub294 \ub354 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub098\uc774\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ubd84\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uacfc AI\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts.

Stewart", "Markus J. Buehler"], "title": "Higher-Order Knowledge Representations for Agentic Scientific Reasoning", "comment": null, "summary": "Scientific inquiry requires systems-level reasoning that integrates heterogeneous experimental data, cross-domain knowledge, and mechanistic evidence into coherent explanations. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a \"teacherless\" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud45c\ud604 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574

However, prevailing systems rely on monolithic agents that suffer from structural bottlenecks, including unconstrained reasoning outputs that inflate trajectories, sparse outcome-level rewards that complicate credit assignment, and stochastic search noise that destabilizes learning. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context. This decomposition allows each agent to focus on a well-defined subtask and reduces interference between search and context construction. Furthermore, to enable stable coordination, M-ASK employs turn-level rewards to provide granular supervision for both search decisions and knowledge updates. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that M-ASK outperforms strong baselines, achieving not only superior answer accuracy but also significantly more stable training dynamics.\\footnote{The source code for M-ASK is available at https://github.com/chenyiqun/M-ASK.}", "AI": {"tldr": "M-ASK\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\ub85c \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub3c4\ubaa8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubcd1\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc11c\uce58\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "M-ASK\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad00\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc11c\uce58\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc11c\ube0c\ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "M-ASK\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec QA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ub2f5\ubcc0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ub9e5\ub77d \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud611\uc870\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc11c\uce58\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uace0\ud1b5\ubc1b\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ubd88\ubc95\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud3ed\uc99d\uc2dc\ucf1c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uacb0\uacfc \ub808\ubca8 \ubcf4\uc0c1, \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc11c\uce58\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad00\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\ub85c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 M-ASK(\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc2dd)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd84\ud574\ub294 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc798 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc11c\ube0c\ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0, \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \ub9e5\ub77d \uad6c\ucd95 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud611\uc870\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 M-ASK\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacb0\uc815\uacfc \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud134 \ub808\ubca8 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 QA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 M-ASK\uac00 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ub2f5\ubcc0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub3d9\ub825\ud559\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations.

Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT$^2$PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, SciIF\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\ud559\uc81c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\ub3c4 \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \ubcc0\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "SciIF\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\ud559\uc81c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \ub300\ud559 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ubaa9\ub85d\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ub9cc\uc871 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc81c\uc57d \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \uce21\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SciIF\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud2c0 \uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uadf8 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ud0d0\uad6c\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uaddc\ubc94\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ub9f9\uc810\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4: \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc900\uc218 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc740 \ud53c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubcc4 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc885 \ub2f5\uc548\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\ub9cc \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc885\uc885 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc774\uc720\ub85c \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \uc900\uc218\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc870\uac74(\uc608: \uacbd\uacc4 \ud655\uc778 \ubc0f \uac00\uc815), \uc758\ubbf8 \uc548\uc815\uc131(\uc608: \ub2e8\uc704 \ubc0f \uae30\ud638 \uaddc\uce59), \ud2b9\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(\uc608: \uc694\uad6c\ub41c \uc218\uce58 \ubc29\ubc95)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ucd08\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ubaa9\ub85d\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ub300\ud559 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc9dd\uc9c0\uc5b4 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ud559\uc81c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 SciIF\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 SciIF\ub294 \uac10\uc0ac \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \uc900\uc218\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ub9cc\uc871\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc81c\uc57d \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \uce21\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, SciIF\ub294 \uad6c\uc131\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud2c0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

To bridge this gap, we propose APEX (Academic Poster Editing agentic eXpert), the first agentic framework for interactive academic poster editing, supporting fine-grained control with robust multi-level API-based editing and a review-and-adjustment Mechanism. In addition, we introduce APEX-Bench, the first systematic benchmark comprising 514 academic poster editing instructions, categorized by a multi-dimensional taxonomy including operation type, difficulty, and abstraction level, constructed via reference-guided and reference-free strategies to ensure realism and diversity. We further establish a multi-dimensional VLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess instruction fulfillment, modification scope, and visual consistency & harmony.

Existing frameworks typically deploy large language models (LLMs) uniformly across all agent roles, failing to account for the varying cognitive demands of different reasoning stages. We address this inefficiency by proposing OI-MAS framework, a novel multi-agent framework that implements an adaptive model-selection policy across a heterogeneous pool of multi-scale LLMs. Specifically, OI-MAS introduces a state-dependent routing mechanism that dynamically selects agent roles and model scales throughout the reasoning process. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism that selects appropriate model scales conditioned on task complexity, thus reducing unnecessary reliance on large-scale models. Experimental results show that OI-MAS consistently outperforms baseline multi-agent systems, improving accuracy by up to 12.88\\% while reducing cost by up to 79.78\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "OI-MAS\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "OI-MAS\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c LLM \ud480\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc758\uc874\uc801 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5ed\ud560\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "OI-MAS\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 12.88\text{%} \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 79.78\text{%} \uc808\uac10\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 OI-MAS\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5ed\ud560\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uace0\ub974\uac8c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c LLM \ud480\uc5d0 \uad6c\ud604\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 OI-MAS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, OI-MAS\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5ed\ud560\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc758\uc874\uc801 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc791\uc5c5 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc OI-MAS\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 12.88\text{%} \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 79.78\text{%} \uc808\uac10\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

So, we need to quickly find a new safe plan. Replanning only the delayed agent often does not result in an efficient plan, and sometimes cannot even yield a feasible plan. On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents. Our algorithm, FlexSIPP, precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, also returning the changes for the other agents, for any single-agent delay within the given scenario. We demonstrate our method in a real-world case study of replanning trains in the densely-used Dutch railway network.

This paper advances the traditional job shop scheduling problem by incorporating additional complexities through the simultaneous integration of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and tool-sharing systems. We propose a novel approach that combines Colored-Timed Petri Nets (CTPNs) with actor-critic model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), effectively addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with FMS. CTPNs provide a formal modeling structure and dynamic action masking, significantly reducing the action search space, while MBRL ensures adaptability to changing environments through the learned policy. Leveraging the advantages of MBRL, we incorporate a lookahead strategy for optimal positioning of AGVs, improving operational efficiency. Our approach was evaluated on small-sized public benchmarks and a newly developed large-scale benchmark inspired by the Taillard benchmark. The results show that our approach matches traditional methods on smaller instances and outperforms them on larger ones in terms of makespan while achieving a tenfold reduction in computation time. To ensure reproducibility, we propose a gym-compatible environment and an instance generator.

Existing works largely focus on optimizing the reasoning paradigms of search agents, yet the quality of intermediate search queries during reasoning remains overlooked. As a result, the generated queries often remain inaccurate, leading to unexpected retrieval results and ultimately limiting search agents' overall effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce SmartSearch, a framework built upon two key mechanisms: (1) Process rewards, which provide fine-grained supervision for the quality of each intermediate search query through Dual-Level Credit Assessment. (2) Query refinement, which promotes the optimization of query generation by selectively refining low-quality search queries and regenerating subsequent search rounds based on these refinements. To enable the search agent to progressively internalize the ability to improve query quality under the guidance of process rewards, we design a three-stage curriculum learning framework. This framework guides the agent through a progression from imitation, to alignment, and ultimately to generalization. Experimental results show that SmartSearch consistently surpasses existing baselines, and additional quantitative analyses further confirm its significant gains in both search efficiency and query quality.

But it remains unclear whether this persuasive power advantages truth over falsehood, or if LLMs can promote misbeliefs just as easily as refuting them. Here, we investigate this question across three pre-registered experiments in which participants (N = 2,724 Americans) discussed a conspiracy theory they were uncertain about with GPT-4o, and the model was instructed to either argue against (\"debunking\") or for (\"bunking\") that conspiracy. When using a \"jailbroken\" GPT-4o variant with guardrails removed, the AI was as effective at increasing conspiracy belief as decreasing it. Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to revent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs possess potent abilities to promote both truth and falsehood, but that potential solutions may exist to help mitigate this risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc9c4\uc2e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc9c4\uc2e4\uacfc \ud5c8\uc704 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "3\uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ub4f1\ub85d\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 GPT-4o\uc640 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc74c\ubaa8\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud1a0\ub860\ud558\uc600\uace0, AI\ub294 \uadf8 \uc74c\ubaa8\ub860\uc744 \ubc18\ubc15\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "'\ud0c8\uc625\ub41c' GPT-4o \ubcc0\ud615\uc774 \uc74c\ubaa8\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc5c8\uace0, '\uc9c0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294' AI\uac00 \ub354 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc740 \uc9c4\uc2e4\uacfc \ud5c8\uc704\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc774 \uc788\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc124\ub4dd\ub825\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\ub4dd\ub825\uc740 \ud5c8\uc704\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9c4\uc2e4\uc5d0 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c\uc9c0, \uc544\ub2c8\uba74 LLM\uc774 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9cc\ud07c \uc798 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucc38\uac00\uc790(N = 2,724 \ubbf8\uad6d\uc778)\uac00 GPT-4o\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ud655\uc2e0\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc74c\ubaa8\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\ub294 3\uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ub4f1\ub85d\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud574\ub2f9 \uc74c\ubaa8\ub860\uc744 \ubc18\ubc15(\u2018\ub514\ubc85\ud0b9\u2019)\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ucc2c\uc131(\u2018\ubc99\ud0b9\u2019)\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubc1b\uc558\ub2e4.

We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's \u03b1 = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (\u03b1 < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an \"evaluative disposition\" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality.

We introduce SimuAgent, an LLM-powered modeling and simulation agent tailored for Simulink. SimuAgent replaces verbose XML with a concise, dictionary-style Python representation, dramatically cutting token counts, improving interpretability, and enabling fast, in-process simulation. A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark.

This undermines the reliability of LLM based agents in production systems as it leads to inconsistent results, and bypasses security and audit controls. Such hallucinations in agent tool selection require early detection and error handling. Unlike existing hallucination detection methods that require multiple forward passes or external validation, we present a computationally efficient framework that detects tool-calling hallucinations in real-time by leveraging LLMs' internal representations during the same forward pass used for generation. We evaluate this approach on reasoning tasks across multiple domains, demonstrating strong detection performance (up to 86.4\\% accuracy) while maintaining real-time inference capabilities with minimal computational overhead, particularly excelling at detecting parameter-level hallucinations and inappropriate tool selections, critical for reliable agent deployment.", "AI": {"tldr":

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d
