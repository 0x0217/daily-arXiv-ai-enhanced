To address this, we introduce the Multi-Objective Markov\nGame (MOMG), a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning with multiple\nobjectives. We propose the Pareto-Nash Equilibrium (PNE) as the primary\nsolution concept, where no agent can unilaterally improve one objective without\nsacrificing performance on another. We prove existence of PNE, and establish an\nequivalence between the PNE and the set of Nash Equilibria of MOMG's\ncorresponding linearly scalarized games, enabling solutions of MOMG by\ntransferring to a standard single-objective Markov game. However, we note that\ncomputing a PNE is theoretically and computationally challenging, thus we\npropose and study weaker but more tractable solution concepts. Building on\nthese foundations, we develop online learning algorithm that identify a single\nsolution to MOMGs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase, preference-free\nalgorithm that decouples exploration from planning. Our algorithm enables\ncomputation of a PNE for any given preference profile without collecting new\nsamples, providing an efficient methodological characterization of the entire\nPareto-Nash front."}

Two important problems to solve in\nthese types of systems are how the intentions of non-coordinating agents can be\ndetermined to predict future behavior and how the agents can achieve their\nobjectives under resource constraints without significantly sacrificing\nperformance. To study this, we develop a model where an autonomous agent\nobserves the environment within a safety radius of observation, determines the\nstate of a surrounding agent of interest (within the observation radius),\nestimates future actions to be taken, and acts in an optimal way. In the\nabsence of observations, agents are able to utilize an estimation algorithm to\npredict the future actions of other agents based on historical trajectory.

This challenge is exacerbated by intentionally\nsilent bug fixes, incomplete or missing CVE assignments, delays in CVE\nissuance, and recent changes to the CVE assignment criteria for the Linux\nkernel. While fine-grained patch classification approaches exist, they exhibit\nlimitations in both coverage and accuracy. In this work, we identify previously\nunexplored opportunities to significantly improve fine-grained patch\nclassification.

In this work, we\nstudy the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce\nhigh-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,\nin the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become\nstrongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and\naligned with the mean gradient.

TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as\ncontextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time\nscenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset\nmeta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ\ntabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce\na novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,\ncapturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize\nacross arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for\ntransferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3\nforecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong\nalignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,\nachieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement\ncompared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score."}

To address these\nchallenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI\nagents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.\nDART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment\ncluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables\nnon-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory\nsampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the\nsystem efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,\nand 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from\nabundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)\npre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement\nsparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers\nand trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on\nhigh-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning\nvia truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout\nand updating.

We answer this question through\ncontrolled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that\nsubliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.\nInstead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where\nteachers with different biases would predict different tokens.

This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.\nFirstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT\ntokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains\nreasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck\nacross reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with\ntoken generation, forcing LLMs to \"think while speaking,\" which causes\npotentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we\nre-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our\napproach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as\na hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional \"thoughts\". Each\nreasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit\nreasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable\nvariables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this\nlatent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we\nfurther propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on\nthree benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous\nreasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to\ntoken-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup\nin inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as\nstep-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant\nopportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs."}

However, real-world FL deployment\nis often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial\nhuman efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),\n(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data\npre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across\nclients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and\ncross-client data characteristics.

These operational bottlenecks\nmotivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent\nagents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively\nmanage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this\nend, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases\nof real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a\nbenchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to\nautonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL\nalgorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and\ncross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of\ncomplex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6\nmodality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,\nUltrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic\nperformance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,\nand large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3\ncan automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more\ncomplex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for\neven the strongest models."}

Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and\nFedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their\nperformance consistently improves as more agents participate in the\ncollaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach."}

Currently, common time series\nforecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches\nprimarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging\nto capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional\nmethods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require\npre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed\nseasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive\nTransformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the\nlimitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining\nEMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing\nseasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale\nadaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four\nparallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,\nenhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A\ndual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately\nprocess seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function\nminimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine\ndatasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets.

Recent work has\nsought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or\nreinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit\ntask. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration\nstrategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by\ntraining LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored\nreward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,\nand an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents\noutperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper\nConfidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x\nlonger horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that\ngains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT\nagents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,\nprematurely abandoning exploration.

However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as\nthe need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.\nTransfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these\nchallenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for\nnew, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from\nscratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage\nthe internal representations learned by the neural network during training.\nSpecifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as\nrefined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the\ninput. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used\nas input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on\nnew tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL\nmodels can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used\nwith linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a\nnovel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce\npositive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging\nthese reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear\nfunction approximation in transfer learning.
