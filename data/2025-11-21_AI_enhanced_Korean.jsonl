Ranasinghe"], "title": "Area-Optimal Control Strategies for Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Pursuit", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper presents a novel strategy for a multi-agent pursuit-evasion game involving multiple faster pursuers with heterogenous speeds and a single slower evader. We define a geometric region, the evader's safe-reachable set, as the intersection of Apollonius circles derived from each pursuer-evader pair. The capture strategy is formulated as a zero-sum game where the pursuers cooperatively minimize the area of this set, while the evader seeks to maximize it, effectively playing a game of spatial containment. By deriving the analytical gradients of the safe-reachable set's area with respect to agent positions, we obtain closed-form, instantaneous optimal control laws for the heading of each agent. These strategies are computationally efficient, allowing for real-time implementation. Simulations demonstrate that the gradient-based controls effectively steer the pursuers to systematically shrink the evader's safe region, leading to guaranteed capture. This area-minimization approach provides a clear geometric objective for cooperative capture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd94\uc801\uc790\uc640 \ud55c \uba85\uc758 \ud53c\ucd94\uc801\uc790\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uae30\uad00 \ucd94\uc801-\ud68c\ud53c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uae30\uad00\uc774 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uc801-\ud68c\ud53c \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ud53c\ucd94\uc801\uc790\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc7a5\ub41c \ud3ec\ud68d\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83.", "method": "\uac01 \ucd94\uc801\uc790-\ud53c\ucd94\uc801\uc790 \uc30d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc544\ud3f4\ub85c\ub2c8\uc6b0\uc2a4 \uc6d0\uc758 \uad50\ucc28\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \ud53c\ucd94\uc801\uc790\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ub3c4\ub2ec \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ud68d \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \uba74\uc801\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc548\uc804 \ub3c4\ub2ec \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \uba74\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc801 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uae30\uad00\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615, \uc21c\uac04\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uc5bb\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc95\uce59\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud53c\ucd94\uc801\uc790\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uc904\uc5ec \ud3ec\ud68d\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uba74\uc801 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ud3ec\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd94\uc801\uc790\uc640 \ud55c \uba85\uc758 \ud53c\ucd94\uc801\uc790\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uae30\uad00 \ucd94\uc801-\ud68c\ud53c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud53c\ucd94\uc801\uc790\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ub3c4\ub2ec \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac01 \ucd94\uc801\uc790-\ud53c\ucd94\uc801\uc790 \uc30d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc544\ud3f4\ub85c\ub2c8\uc6b0\uc2a4 \uc6d0\uc758 \uad50\ucc28\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4. \ud3ec\ud68d \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc131\ub418\uba70, \ucd94\uc801\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \uba74\uc801\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud53c\ucd94\uc801\uc790\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \ub3c4\ub2ec \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \uba74\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uae30\uad00\uc758 \ud5a5\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615, \uc21c\uac04\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uc5bb\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uad6c\ud604\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ucd94\uc801\uc790\ub4e4\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\ucd94\uc801\uc790\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3ec\ud68d\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774 \uba74\uc801 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ud3ec\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We propose a framework where agents adopt coupled policies that depend on both local states and parameters, as well as those of their $\u03ba_p$-hop neighbors, with $\u03ba_p>0$ denoting the coupling distance. A distributed primal-dual algorithm is further developed under this framework, wherein each agent has access only to state-action pairs within its $2\u03ba_p$-hop neighborhood and to reward information within its $\u03ba+ 2\u03ba_p$-hop neighborhood, with $\u03ba> 0$ representing the truncation distance. Moreover, agents are not permitted to directly share their true policy parameters or Lagrange multipliers. Instead, each agent constructs and maintains local estimates of these variables for other agents and employs such estimates to execute its policy. Additionally, these estimates are further updated and exchanged exclusively through an independent, time-varying networks, which enhances the overall system security. We establish that, with high probability, our algorithm can achieve an $\u03b5$-first-order stationary convergence with an approximation error of $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b3^{\\frac{\u03ba+1}{\u03ba_{p}}})$ for discount factor $\u03b3\\in(0,1)$.

As an evaluation technique, existing adversarial attack frameworks face certain limitations, e.g., impracticality due to the requirement of white-box information or high control authority, and a lack of stealthiness or effectiveness as they often target all agents or specific fixed agents. To address these issues, we propose AdapAM, a novel framework for adversarial attacks on black-box MAS. AdapAM incorporates two key components: (1) Adaptive Selection Policy simultaneously selects the victim and determines the anticipated malicious action (the action would lead to the worst impact on MAS), balancing effectiveness and stealthiness. (2) Proxy-based Perturbation to Induce Malicious Action utilizes generative adversarial imitation learning to approximate the target MAS, allowing AdapAM to generate perturbed observations using white-box information and thus induce victims to execute malicious action in black-box settings. We evaluate AdapAM across eight multi-agent environments and compare it with four state-of-the-art and commonly-used baselines.

Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios.\n  To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.\n  We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc131\uc744

Thus, developing optimal takeoff trajectories for minimum energy consumption becomes essential for broader eVTOL aircraft applications. Conventional optimal control methods (such as dynamic programming and linear quadratic regulator) provide highly efficient and well-established solutions but are limited by problem dimensionality and complexity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a special type of artificial intelligence tackling complex, nonlinear systems; however, the training difficulty is a key bottleneck that limits DRL applications. To address these challenges, we propose the transformer-guided DRL to alleviate the training difficulty by exploring a realistic state space at each time step using a transformer. The proposed transformer-guided DRL was demonstrated on an optimal takeoff trajectory design of an eVTOL drone for minimal energy consumption while meeting takeoff conditions (i.e., minimum vertical displacement and minimum horizontal velocity) by varying control variables (i.e., power and wing angle to the vertical). Results presented that the transformer-guided DRL agent learned to take off with $4.57\\times10^6$ time steps, representing 25% of the $19.79\\times10^6$ time steps needed by a vanilla DRL agent. In addition, the transformer-guided DRL achieved 97.2% accuracy on the optimal energy consumption compared against the simulation-based optimal reference while the vanilla DRL achieved 96.3% accuracy. Therefore, the proposed transformer-guided DRL outperformed vanilla DRL in terms of both training efficiency as well as optimal design verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778

Retraining is limited by the cost and time of manual labeling or sandbox analysis. Existing approaches mitigate this via drift detection and selective labeling, but fully label-free adaptation remains largely unexplored. Recent self-training methods use a previously trained model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and then train a new model on these labels. The unlabeled data are used only for inference and do not participate in training the earlier model. We argue that these unlabeled samples still carry valuable information that can be leveraged when incorporated appropriately into training. This paper introduces LFreeDA, an end-to-end framework that adapts malware classifiers to drift without manual labeling or drift detection. LFreeDA first performs unsupervised domain adaptation on malware images, jointly training on labeled and unlabeled samples to infer pseudo-labels and prune noisy ones. It then adapts a classifier on CFG representations using the labeled and selected pseudo-labeled data, leveraging the scalability of images for pseudo-labeling and the richer semantics of CFGs for final adaptation. Evaluations on the real-world MB-24+ dataset show that LFreeDA improves accuracy by up to 12.6% and F1 by 11.1% over no-adaptation lower bounds, and is only 4% and 3.4% below fully supervised upper bounds in accuracy and F1, respectively. It also matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods provided with ground truth labels for 300 target samples. Additional results on two controlled-drift benchmarks further confirm that LFreeDA maintains malware detection performance as malware evolves without human labeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "LFreeDA\ub294 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\uc774\ub098 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub9ec\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc0ac \ub77c\ubca8\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub9ec\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\uc871\uc774 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\ub3d9 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1 \ub610\ub294 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LFreeDA\ub294 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub9ec\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc0ac \ub77c\ubca8\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0, CFG \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "LFreeDA\ub294 MB-24+ \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 12.6% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c 11.1% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc644\uc804 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc120\uacfc \uac01\uac01 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ubc0f F1\uc5d0\uc11c 4% \ubc0f 3.4% \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LFreeDA\ub294 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ub9ec\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub9ec\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub9ec\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\uc871\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc218\ub3d9 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1 \ub610\ub294 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ube44\ub77c\ubca8 \uc801\uc751\uc740 \ud070 \ud3ed\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc790\uae30 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\uc0ac \ub77c\ubca8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub77c\ubca8\ub85c \uc0c8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uba70 \uc774\uc804 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\ub294 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \uc801\uc808\ud558\uac8c \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LFreeDA\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\uc774\ub098 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub9ec\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Applications to medical signal retrieval and activity recognition. Correspondence: m.shi16@imperial.ac.uk", "summary": "Neural networks exhibit severe brittleness to semantically irrelevant transformations. A mere 75ms electrocardiogram (ECG) phase shift degrades latent cosine similarity from 1.0 to 0.2, while sensor rotations collapse activity recognition performance with inertial measurement units (IMUs). We identify the root cause as \"laissez-faire\" representation learning, where latent spaces evolve unconstrained provided task performance is satisfied. We propose Structured Contrastive Learning (SCL), a framework that partitions latent space representations into three semantic groups: invariant features that remain consistent under given transformations (e.g., phase shifts or rotations), variant features that actively differentiate transformations via a novel variant mechanism, and free features that preserve task flexibility. This creates controllable push-pull dynamics where different latent dimensions serve distinct, interpretable purposes. The variant mechanism enhances contrastive learning by encouraging variant features to differentiate within positive pairs, enabling simultaneous robustness and interpretability. Our approach requires no architectural modifications and integrates seamlessly into existing training pipelines. Experiments on ECG phase invariance and IMU rotation robustness demonstrate superior performance: ECG similarity improves from 0.25 to 0.91 under phase shifts, while WISDM activity recognition achieves 86.65% accuracy with 95.38% rotation consistency, consistently outperforming traditional data augmentation.

Current AI systems operate on opaque data structures that lack the audit trails, provenance tracking, or explainability required by emerging regulations like the EU AI Act. We propose an artifact-centric AI agent paradigm where behavior is driven by persistent, verifiable data artifacts rather than ephemeral tasks, solving the trustworthiness problem at the data architecture level. Central to this approach is the Multimodal Artifact File Format (MAIF), an AI-native container embedding semantic representations, cryptographic provenance, and granular access controls. MAIF transforms data from passive storage into active trust enforcement, making every AI operation inherently auditable. Our production-ready implementation demonstrates ultra-high-speed streaming (2,720.7 MB/s), optimized video processing (1,342 MB/s), and enterprise-grade security. Novel algorithms for cross-modal attention, semantic compression, and cryptographic binding achieve up to 225 compression while maintaining semantic fidelity.

The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis.

In response, numerous IPI-centric defense frameworks have emerged. However, these defenses are fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we present the first comprehensive analysis of IPI-centric defense frameworks. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of these defenses, classifying them along five dimensions. We then thoroughly assess the security and usability of representative defense frameworks. Through analysis of defensive failures in the assessment, we identify six root causes of defense circumvention. Based on these findings, we design three novel adaptive attacks that significantly improve attack success rates targeting specific frameworks, demonstrating the severity of the flaws in these defenses.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are easily corrupted by artifacts and individual variability, while emotional labels often stem from subjective and inconsistent reports-making robust affective decoding particularly difficult. We propose an uncertainty-aware active learning framework that enhances robustness to label noise by jointly leveraging model uncertainty and cross-modal consistency. Instead of relying solely on EEG-based uncertainty estimates, the method evaluates cross-modal alignment to determine whether uncertainty originates from cognitive ambiguity or sensor noise. A representation alignment module embeds EEG and face features into a shared latent space, enforcing semantic coherence between modalities. Residual discrepancies are treated as noise-induced inconsistencies, and these samples are selectively queried for oracle feedback during active learning. This feedback-driven process guides the network toward reliable, informative samples and reduces the impact of noisy labels.

This article presents a unified perspective on cross-domain vulnerabilities that arise across integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), federated learning (FL), digital twins (DTs), diffusion models (DMs), and large telecommunication models (LTMs). We highlight emerging adversarial agents such as compromised DTs and LTMs that can manipulate both the physical and cognitive layers of 6G systems. To address these risks, we propose an adaptive evolutionary defense (AED) concept that continuously co-evolves with attacks through GenAI-driven simulation and feedback, combining physical-layer protection, secure learning pipelines, and cognitive-layer resilience. A case study using an LLM-based port prediction model for fluid-antenna systems demonstrates the susceptibility of GenAI modules to adversarial perturbations and the effectiveness of the proposed defense concept.

However, the scarcity of fault data, due to the rarity of fault events and the high cost of data annotation, significantly hinders data-driven approaches. Existing time-series generation models, optimized for abundant normal data, struggle to capture fault distributions in few-shot scenarios, producing samples that lack authenticity and diversity due to the large domain gap and high intra-class variability of faults. To address this, we propose a novel few-shot fault time-series generation framework based on diffusion models. Our approach employs a positive-negative difference adapter, leveraging pre-trained normal data distributions to model the discrepancies between normal and fault domains for accurate fault synthesis. Additionally, a diversity loss is introduced to prevent mode collapse, encouraging the generation of diverse fault samples through inter-sample difference regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional methods in authenticity and diversity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on key benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr":

Under review", "summary": "The proliferation of IoT devices in shared, multi-vendor environments like the modern aircraft cabin creates a fundamental conflict between the promise of data collaboration and the risks to passenger privacy, vendor intellectual property (IP), and regulatory compliance. While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves.

However, existing methods rely on frequent adaptation and high computational cost, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge environments. To address this, we propose SNAP, a sparse TTA framework that reduces adaptation frequency and data usage while preserving accuracy. SNAP maintains competitive accuracy even when adapting based on only 1% of the incoming data stream, demonstrating its robustness under infrequent updates. Our method introduces two key components: (i) Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM), which identifies and stores a small set of samples that are representative of both class and domain characteristics to support efficient adaptation with limited data; and (ii) Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN), which dynamically adjusts normalization statistics at inference time by leveraging these representative samples, enabling efficient alignment to shifting target domains. Integrated with five state-of-the-art TTA algorithms, SNAP reduces latency by up to 93.12%, while keeping the accuracy drop below 3.3%, even across adaptation rates ranging from 1% to 50%. This demonstrates its strong potential for practical use on edge devices serving latency-sensitive applications.

In practice, however, many real-world exits violate these assumptions by splitting the attack across both time and actor dimensions: attackers break total extraction into many low-impact trades and route proceeds through multiple non-owner addresses, producing low-visibility drains.\n  We formalize this family of attacks as the fragmented rug pull (FRP) and offer a compact recipe for a slow-stewed beef special: (i) keep the lid on (to preserve LP control so on-chain extraction remains feasible), (ii) chop thin slices (to split the total exit volume into many low-impact micro-trades that individually fall below impact thresholds), and (iii) pass the ladle (to delegate sells across multiple wallets so that each participant takes a small share of the extraction). Technically, we define three atomic predicate groups and show that their orthogonal combinations yield evasive strategies overlooked by prior heuristics (USENIX Sec 19, USENIX Sec 23).\n  We validate the model with large-scale measurements. Our corpus contains 303,614 LPs, among which 105,434 are labeled as FRP pools. The labeled subset includes 34,192,767 pool-related transactions and 401,838 inflated-seller wallets, involving 1,501,408 unique interacting addresses. Notably, owner-wallet participation in inflated selling among FRP-flagged LPs has declined substantially (33.1% of cases), indicating a shift in scam behavior: the liquidity drain is no longer held on the owner wallet. We also detected 127,252 wallets acting as serial scammers when repeatedly engaging in inflated selling across multiple FRP LPs. Our empirical findings demonstrate that the evasive strategies we define are widespread and operationally significant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758

This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). Discussion: The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels. The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians. However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks. Conclusion: CAP utilizes LLM agents to integrate ML classifier outcomes and cost-benefit analysis for more transparent and interpretable decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

While electroencephalography (EEG) is a practical tool for this task, existing models struggle with the common challenge of imperfect medical data, such as learning a ``normal'' baseline from weakly supervised, healthy-only cohorts. This is a critical anomaly detection task for identifying disease, but standard models are often black boxes lacking an interpretable structure. We propose EVA-Net, a novel framework that recasts brain age as an interpretable anomaly detection problem. EVA-Net uses an efficient, sparsified-attention Transformer to model long EEG sequences. To handle noise and variability in imperfect data, it employs a Variational Information Bottleneck to learn a robust, compressed representation. For interpretability, this representation is aligned to a continuous prototype network that explicitly learns the normative healthy aging manifold. Trained on 1297 healthy subjects, EVA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. We validated its anomaly detection capabilities on an unseen cohort of 27 MCI and AD patients. This pathological group showed significantly higher brain-age gaps and a novel Prototype Alignment Error, confirming their deviation from the healthy manifold. EVA-Net provides an interpretable framework for healthcare intelligence using imperfect medical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "EVA-Net\uc740 \ub1cc \ub098\uc774\ub97c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub1cc \ub098\uc774\ub294 \ub1cc \uac74\uac15\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc774\uba70, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 '\uc815\uc0c1' \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "EVA-Net\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 EEG \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud76c\uc18c \uc8fc\uc758 Transformer\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcc0\uc774\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc555\ucd95 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "EVA-Net\uc740 1297\uba85\uc758 \uac74\uac15\ud55c \ud53c\ud5d8\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, 27\uba85\uc758 MCI \ubc0f AD \ud658\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EVA-Net\uc740 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc804\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub1cc \ub098\uc774\ub294 \ub1cc \uac74\uac15\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub1cc\ud30c(EEG)\ub294 \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc57d\ud558\uac8c \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \uac74\uac15\ud55c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 '\uc815\uc0c1' \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\uba70, \ud45c\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub1cc \ub098\uc774\ub97c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 EVA-Net\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We show how data, which was not part of the TSFM training data corpus, can be classified without the need of finetuning the model. Examples are represented in the form of targets (class id) and covariates (data matrix) within the prompt of the model, which enables to classify an unknown covariate data pattern alongside the forecast axis through in-context learning. We apply this method to vibration data for assessing the health state of a bearing within a servo-press motor. The method transforms frequency domain reference signals into pseudo time-series patterns, generates aligned covariate and target signals, and uses the TSFM to predict probabilities how classified data corresponds to predefined labels. Leveraging the scalability of pre-trained models this method demonstrates efficacy across varied operational conditions.

However, fitting high-resolution signals demands optimizing over millions of coordinates, incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address it, we propose NTK-Guided Implicit Neural Teaching (NINT), which accelerates training by dynamically selecting coordinates that maximize global functional updates. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), NINT scores examples by the norm of their NTK-augmented loss gradients, capturing both fitting errors and heterogeneous leverage (self-influence and cross-coordinate coupling). This dual consideration enables faster convergence compared to existing methods.

This is particularly useful in multi-task settings or in non-stationary environments, where the dynamics can change over time. This is particularly relevant in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous driving. However, despite recent advances in CL, successfully applying it to reinforcement learning (RL) is still an open problem.\n  This paper highlights open challenges in continual RL (CRL) based on experiments in an autonomous driving environment. In this environment, the agent must learn to successfully park in four different scenarios corresponding to parking spaces oriented at varying angles. The agent is successively trained in these four scenarios one after another, representing a CL environment, using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). These experiments exposed a number of open challenges in CRL: finding suitable abstractions of the environment, oversensitivity to hyperparameters, catastrophic forgetting, and efficient use of neural network capacity.\n  Based on these identified challenges, we present open research questions that are important to be addressed for creating robust CRL systems. In addition, the identified challenges call into question the suitability of neural networks for CL. We also identify the need for interdisciplinary research, in particular between computer science and neuroscience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uc18d \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uacc4\uac00 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc7ac\uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Proximal Policy Optimisation(PPO)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc8fc\ucc28 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654, \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ubbfc \ubc18\uc751, \uc7ac\uc559\uc801 \ub9dd\uac01, \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 CRL\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ub178\ucd9c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 CRL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uacfc \uc2e0\uacbd \uacfc\ud559 \uac04\uc758 \ud559\uc81c\uac04 \uc5f0\uad6c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5(C_L)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc7ac\uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc774\ub098 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \uc720\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(R_L)\uc5d0 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uc18d \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(C_R_L)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac01\ub3c4\ub85c \ubc30\uce58\ub41c \uc8fc\ucc28 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\ucc28\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 CL \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc774 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654, \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ubbfc \ubc18\uc751, \uc7ac\uc559\uc801 \ub9dd\uac01 \ubc0f \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ub4f1 C_R_L\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud655\uc778\ub41c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud55c C_R_L \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc57c \ud560 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4, \ud655\uc778\ub41c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \ubb38\uc81c \uc0bc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uacfc \uc2e0\uacbd \uacfc\ud559 \uac04\uc758 \ud559\uc81c\uac04 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\ub3c4 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models show promise in optimizing network resources, they often struggle with robustness and generalizability in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a novel resource management approach that enhances the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in a distributed Multi-Agent RL (MARL) framework. Our method introduces an adaptive and selective SAM mechanism, where regularization is explicitly driven by temporal-difference (TD)-error variance, ensuring that only agents facing high environmental complexity are regularized. This targeted strategy reduces unnecessary overhead, improves training stability, and enhances generalization without sacrificing learning efficiency. We further incorporate a dynamic $\u03c1$ scheduling scheme to refine the exploration-exploitation trade-off across agents. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms conventional DRL approaches, yielding up to a $22\\%$ improvement in resource allocation efficiency and ensuring superior QoS satisfaction across diverse O-RAN slices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Soft Actor Critic(SAC) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 Sharpness-Aware Minimization(SAM)\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc74c \uc138\ub300 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 Open Radio Access Network(O-RAN) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec RAN Intelligent Controller(RIC)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Soft Actor Critic(SAC) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 Sharpness-Aware Minimization(SAM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 $22\\\\%$ \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c O-RAN \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c QoS \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucc28\uc138\ub300 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 Open Radio Access Network(O-RAN) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec RAN Intelligent Controller(RIC)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc790\uc6d0\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c Sharpness-Aware Minimization(SAM)\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ud654\ub41c Soft Actor Critic(SAC) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ucc28\uc774(TD) \uc624\ub958 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\ub3c4\ub418\ub294 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uac00 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc778 SAM \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec, \ub192\uc740 \ud658\uacbd \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub9cc \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud0d0\uc0c9-\ud65c\uc6a9 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc815\uad50\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 $\u03c1$ \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 DRL \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 $22\\\\%$ \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c O-RAN \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c QoS \ub9cc\uc871\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Accepted for publication at AIAS 2025", "summary": "We present Ask WhAI, a systems-level framework for inspecting and perturbing belief states in multi-agent interactions. The framework records and replays agent interactions, supports out-of-band queries into each agent's beliefs and rationale, and enables counterfactual evidence injection to test how belief structures respond to new information. We apply the framework to a medical case simulator notable for its multi-agent shared memory (a time-stamped electronic medical record, or EMR) and an oracle agent (the LabAgent) that holds ground truth lab results revealed only when explicitly queried. We stress-test the system on a multi-specialty diagnostic journey for a child with an abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric presentation. Large language model agents, each primed with strong role-specific priors (\"act like a neurologist\", \"act like an infectious disease specialist\"), write to a shared medical record and interact with a moderator across sequential or parallel encounters. Breakpoints at key diagnostic moments enable pre- and post-event belief queries, allowing us to distinguish entrenched priors from reasoning or evidence-integration effects. The simulation reveals that agent beliefs often mirror real-world disciplinary stances, including overreliance on canonical studies and resistance to counterevidence, and that these beliefs can be traced and interrogated in ways not possible with human experts.

Although reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved superhuman performance in many domains, relatively little attention has been focused on designing human-like RL agents. As a result, many reward-driven RL agents often exhibit unnatural behaviors compared to humans, raising concerns for both interpretability and trustworthiness. To achieve human-like behavior in RL, this paper first formulates human-likeness as trajectory optimization, where the objective is to find an action sequence that closely aligns with human behavior while also maximizing rewards, and adapts the classic receding-horizon control to human-like learning as a tractable and efficient implementation. To achieve this, we introduce Macro Action Quantization (MAQ), a human-like RL framework that distills human demonstrations into macro actions via Vector-Quantized VAE. Experiments on D4RL Adroit benchmarks show that MAQ significantly improves human-likeness, increasing trajectory similarity scores, and achieving the highest human-likeness rankings among all RL agents in the human evaluation study. Our results also demonstrate that MAQ can be easily integrated into various off-the-shelf RL algorithms, opening a promising direction for learning human-like RL agents.

GeneGPT addressed this challenge by combining domain-specific APIs with OpenAI's code-davinci-002 large language model to enable natural language interaction with genomic databases. However, its reliance on a proprietary model limits scalability, increases operational costs, and raises concerns about data privacy and generalization.\n  In this work, we revisit and reproduce GeneGPT in a pilot study using open source models, including Llama 3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen2.5 Coder, within a monolithic architecture; this allows us to identify the limitations of this approach. Building on this foundation, we then develop OpenBioLLM, a modular multi-agent framework that extends GeneGPT by introducing agent specialization for tool routing, query generation, and response validation. This enables coordinated reasoning and role-based task execution.\n  OpenBioLLM matches or outperforms GeneGPT on over 90% of the benchmark tasks, achieving average scores of 0.849 on Gene-Turing and 0.830 on GeneHop, while using smaller open-source models without additional fine-tuning or tool-specific pretraining.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a \"flooding-pruning\" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets. Furthermore, we show qualitatively that the system surfaces novel, testable hypotheses, such as identifying a new potential biomarker in the myocardial dataset, underscoring its utility as a tool for scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Rogue One\uc740 \uc9c8 \ub192\uc740 \ud2b9\uc131 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(Scientist, Extractor, Tester)\uac00 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac, \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud2b9\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud2b9\uc131 \ucd94\ucd9c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Rogue One\uc740 Scientist, Extractor, Tester\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc6b4\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Rogue One\uc740 19\uac1c\uc758 \ubd84\ub958 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc 9\uac1c\uc758 \ud68c\uadc0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Rogue One\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\uc124\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud2b9\uc131 \ucd94\ucd9c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654(AutoFE)\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c LLM \uad6c\uc870, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31, \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2e4\ud328 \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc131 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Rogue One\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

SOLID facilitates iterative collaboration between optimization and LLMs agents through dual prices and deviation penalties. This interaction improves the quality of the decisions while maintaining modularity and data privacy. The framework retains theoretical convergence guarantees under convexity assumptions, providing insight into the design of LLMs prompt. To evaluate SOLID, we applied it to a stock portfolio investment case with historical prices and financial news as inputs. Empirical results demonstrate convergence under various scenarios and indicate improved annualized returns compared to a baseline optimizer-only method, validating the synergy of the two agents.

Consequently, they struggle to adapt to dynamically changing capability requirements in real-world tasks. Meanwhile, humans exhibit a complementary set of thinking abilities when addressing such tasks, whereas existing methods typically cover only a subset of these dimensions. Inspired by this, we propose Octopus: Agentic Multimodal Reasoning with Six-Capability Orchestration, a new paradigm for multimodal agentic reasoning. We define six core capabilities essential for multimodal reasoning and organize a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, Octopus-Bench, accordingly. Octopus is capable of autonomously exploring during reasoning and dynamically selecting the most appropriate capability based on the current state. Experimental results show that Octopus achieves the best performance on the vast majority of tasks in Octopus-Bench, highlighting the crucial role of capability coordination in agentic multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Octopus\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc911\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, Octopus-Bench\ub77c\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uc5ec Octopus\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "Octopus\ub294 Octopus-Bench\uc758 \ub300\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2a5\ub825 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uac01 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc801 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc870\uc791 \ub610\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8, \uc778\uac04\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ub54c \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80\ub9cc\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 Octopus\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc778 Octopus-Bench\ub97c \uc870\uc9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. We study this in a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) setting, curating 1,000+ heterogeneous games with diverse physical and causal mechanisms, and evaluate at three human-like levels: Survival, Curiosity, Utility, from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning. Our analysis reveals complementary failures: VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on three levels, matches GPT-5 overall, and surpasses it on Curiosity. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd9c \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 IPR(Interactive Physical Reasoner) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud68d\ub4dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ub358\uc9c0\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "1,000\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, IPR\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 VLM\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "IPR \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc778\uac04 \uc720\uc0ac \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uac74\ud558\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70, GPT-5\uc640 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\uc784\uc744 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04\uc740 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uace0 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uba70 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uacfc \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubc30\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc9c8\ubb38\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 1,000\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0, \ud504\ub9ac\ubbf8\ud2f0\ube0c \uc9c1\uad00\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc874, \ud638\uae30\uc2ec, \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc778\uac04 \uc720\uc0ac \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4: VLM/VLA \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\ub9ac \ubcf4\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0, \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uacfc \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec VLM\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 IPR(Interactive Physical Reasoner)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 1,000\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 IPR\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uac74\ud558\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c GPT-5\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uace0 \ud638\uae30\uc2ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc804\uc774\ub3c4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\uc784\uc744 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing methods lack deep semantic insight. To address this, we propose the Transaction Intent Mining (TIM) framework. TIM leverages a DeFi intent taxonomy built on grounded theory and a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system to robustly infer user intents. A Meta-Level Planner dynamically coordinates domain experts to decompose multiple perspective-specific intent analyses into solvable subtasks. Question Solvers handle the tasks with multi-modal on/off-chain data. While a Cognitive Evaluator mitigates LLM hallucinations and ensures verifiability.

Studying the Role of Ideation Diversity", "comment": null, "summary": "AI research agents offer the promise to accelerate scientific progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine learning models. However, the field is still in its infancy, and the key factors driving the success or failure of agent trajectories are not fully understood. We examine the role that ideation diversity plays in agent performance. First, we analyse agent trajectories on MLE-bench, a well-known benchmark to evaluate AI research agents, across different models and agent scaffolds. Our analysis reveals that different models and agent scaffolds yield varying degrees of ideation diversity, and that higher-performing agents tend to have increased ideation diversity. Further, we run a controlled experiment where we modify the degree of ideation diversity, demonstrating that higher ideation diversity results in stronger performance. Finally, we strengthen our results by examining additional evaluation metrics beyond the standard medal-based scoring of MLE-bench, showing that our findings still hold across other agent performance metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5f0\uad6c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc124\uacc4, \uad6c\ud604 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5f0\uad6c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\uacf5 \ub610\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc774\ub044\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MLE-bench\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2a4\uce90\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2a4\uce90\ud3f4\ub4dc\uac00 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc801\uc6a9\ub428\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5f0\uad6c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc124\uacc4, \uad6c\ud604 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc9c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \uc544\uc9c1 \ucd08\uae30\uc5d0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc774\ub098 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc774\ub044\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc18c\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 AI \uc5f0\uad6c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 MLE-bench\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2a4\uce90\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2a4\uce90\ud3f4\ub4dc\uac00 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc815\ub3c4\uc758 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c8\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac00, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc758 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec, \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uac15\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MLE-bench\uc758 \ud45c\uc900 \uba54\ub2ec \uae30\ubc18 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc720\ud6a8\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4."}}
