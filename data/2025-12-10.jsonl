Building on this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo, using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. The crucial step in this iterative process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals, however, remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a holistic model that encompasses agent bounded rationality and uncertainty and developing AI models to generate such compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaboratively writing text documents -- e.g., to enable the democratic creation of a community constitution. We apply NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques and utilize LLMs (Large Language Models) to create a semantic metric space for text and develop algorithms to suggest suitable compromise points. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we simulate various coalition formation processes and demonstrate the potential of AI to facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, such as collaboratively drafting a constitution, an area where traditional tools are limited."}

However, evaluating each individual agent's effectiveness and online optimization of underperforming agents remain open challenges. To address these issues, we present HiveMind, a self-adaptive framework designed to optimize LLM multi-agent collaboration through contribution analysis. At its core, HiveMind introduces Contribution-Guided Online Prompt Optimization (CG-OPO), which autonomously refines agent prompts based on their quantified contributions. We first propose the Shapley value as a grounded metric to quantify each agent's contribution, thereby identifying underperforming agents in a principled manner for automated prompt refinement. To overcome the computational complexity of the classical Shapley value, we present DAG-Shapley, a novel and efficient attribution algorithm that leverages the inherent Directed Acyclic Graph structure of the agent workflow to axiomatically prune non-viable coalitions. By hierarchically reusing intermediate outputs of agents in the DAG, our method further reduces redundant computations, and achieving substantial cost savings without compromising the theoretical guarantees of Shapley values. Evaluated in a multi-agent stock-trading scenario, HiveMind achieves superior performance compared to static baselines. Notably, DAG-Shapley reduces LLM calls by over 80\\% while maintaining attribution accuracy comparable to full Shapley values, establishing a new standard for efficient credit assignment and enabling scalable, real-world optimization of multi-agent collaboration."}

This paper presents ChargingBoul, a negotiating agent that competed in the 2022 Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) and placed second in individual utility by an exceptionally narrow margin. ChargingBoul employs a lightweight yet effective strategy that balances concession and opponent modeling to achieve high negotiation outcomes. The agent classifies opponents based on bid patterns, dynamically adjusts its bidding strategy, and applies a concession policy in later negotiation stages to maximize utility while fostering agreements. We evaluate ChargingBoul's performance using competition results and subsequent studies that have utilized the agent in negotiation research. Our analysis highlights ChargingBoul's effectiveness across diverse opponent strategies and its contributions to advancing automated negotiation techniques. We also discuss potential enhancements, including more sophisticated opponent modeling and adaptive bidding heuristics, to improve its performance further."}

Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers promising capabilities for traffic signal control, ensuring safety in such environments remains difficult. As a direct indicator of traffic risk, the collision rate must be well understood and incorporated into traffic control design. This study investigates the primary factors influencing collision rates in a MARL-governed Mixed Traffic Control (MTC) network. We examine three dimensions: total vehicle count, signalized versus unsignalized intersection configurations, and turning-movement strategies. Through controlled simulation experiments, we evaluate how each factor affects collision likelihood. The results show that collision rates are sensitive to traffic density, the level of signal coordination, and turning-control design. These findings provide practical insights for improving the safety and robustness of MARL-based mixed traffic control systems, supporting the development of intelligent transportation systems in which both efficiency and safety are jointly optimized."}

Effective alignment in such settings requires reward models that are interpretable so that stakeholders can understand and audit model objectives. Moreover, reward models must be capable of steering agents at interaction time, allowing preference shifts to be incorporated without retraining. We introduce ARCANE, a framework that frames alignment as a multi-agent collaboration problem that dynamically represents stakeholder preferences as natural-language rubrics: weighted sets of verifiable criteria that can be generated on-the-fly from task context. Inspired by utility theory, we formulate rubric learning as a reconstruction problem and apply a regularized Group-Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) procedure that balances interpretability, faithfulness, and computational efficiency. Using a corpus of 219 labeled rubrics derived from the GDPVal benchmark, we evaluate ARCANE on challenging tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and tool use. The learned rubrics produce compact, legible evaluations and enable configurable trade-offs (e.g., correctness vs. conciseness) without retraining. Our results show that rubric-based reward models offer a promising path toward interpretable, test-time adaptive alignment for complex, long-horizon AI systems."}

Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems."}

The MDL endows CompressARC with extreme generalization abilities typically unheard of in deep learning. To our knowledge, CompressARC is the only deep learning method for ARC-AGI where training happens only on a single sample: the target inference puzzle itself, with the final solution information removed. Moreover, CompressARC does not train on the pre-provided ARC-AGI \"training set\". Under these extremely data-limited conditions, we do not ordinarily expect any puzzles to be solvable at all.

In this approach, calibrated noise $\\mathbf{n}\\in\\mathbb{R}^M$ is used to obscure the difference vector $f(\\mathbf{x})-f(\\mathbf{x}')$, where $\\mathbf{x}'$ is known as a neighboring dataset. A DP guarantee is obtained by studying the tail probability bound of a privacy loss random variable (PLRV), defined as the Radon-Nikodym derivative between two distributions. When $\\mathbf{n}$ follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution, the PLRV is characterized as a specific univariate Gaussian. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to generate $\\mathbf{n}$ by leveraging the fact that the perturbation noise is typically spherically symmetric (i.e., the distribution is rotationally invariant around the origin). The new noise generation scheme allows us to investigate the privacy loss from a geometric perspective and express the resulting PLRV using a product measure, $W\\times U$; measure $W$ is related to a radius random variable controlling the magnitude of $\\mathbf{n}$, while measure $U$ involves a directional random variable governing the angle between $\\mathbf{n}$ and the difference $f(\\mathbf{x})-f(\\mathbf{x}')$. We derive a closed-form moment bound on the product measure to prove $(ε,δ)$-DP. Under the same $(ε,δ)$-DP guarantee, our mechanism yields a smaller expected noise magnitude than the classic Gaussian noise in high dimensions, thereby significantly improving the utility of the noisy result $f(\\mathbf{x})+\\mathbf{n}$.

We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition. By operationalizing a philosophical inquiry about representation, we equip philosophers of science, computer scientists, linguists, and mathematicians with a common language and technical framework for systematic investigation of grounding and meaning."}

Practitioners frequently tend to study or compare MARL algorithms from a qualitative perspective largely due to the inherent stochasticity in practical algorithms arising from random dithering exploration strategies, environment transition noise, and stochastic gradient updates to name a few. Traditional analytical approaches, such as replicator dynamics, often rely on mean-field approximations to remove stochastic effects, but this simplification, whilst able to provide general overall trends, might lead to dissonance between analytical predictions and actual realisations of individual trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on MARL systems by modelling them as \\textit{coupled stochastic dynamical systems}, capturing both agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyse the stability and sensitivity of agent behaviour at individual level, which are key dimensions for their practical deployments, for example, in presence of strict safety requirements. This framework allows us, for the first time, to rigorously study MARL dynamics taking into consideration their inherent stochasticity, providing a deeper understanding of system behaviour and practical insights for the design and control of multi-agent learning processes."}

Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($α$) and biological ($β$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression."}

This is because the vast majority of existing methodologies exploit various levels of approximations that lower accuracy and limit the flexibility of kernel and noise-model designs -- an unacceptable drawback at a time when expressive non-stationary kernels are on the rise in many fields. Here, we propose a methodology we term \\emph{gp2Scale} that scales exact Gaussian processes to more than 10 million data points without relying on inducing points, kernel interpolation, or neighborhood-based approximations, and instead leveraging the existing capabilities of a GP: its kernel design. Highly flexible, compactly supported, and non-stationary kernels lead to the identification of naturally occurring sparse structure in the covariance matrix, which is then exploited for the calculations of the linear system solution and the log-determinant for training. We demonstrate our method's functionality on several real-world datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art approximation algorithms. Although we show superior approximation performance in many cases, the method's real power lies in its agnosticism toward arbitrary GP customizations -- core kernel design, noise, and mean functions -- and the type of input space, making it optimally suited for modern Gaussian process applications."}

We propose \\emph{Temporal Range}, a model-agnostic metric that treats first-order sensitivities of multiple vector outputs across a temporal window to the input sequence as a temporal influence profile and summarizes it by the magnitude-weighted average lag. Temporal Range is computed via reverse-mode automatic differentiation from the Jacobian blocks $\\partial y_s/\\partial x_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{c\\times d}$ averaged over final timesteps $s\\in\\{t+1,\\dots,T\\}$ and is well-characterized in the linear setting by a small set of natural axioms.

We also report Temporal Range for a compact Long Expressive Memory (LEM) policy trained on the task, using it as a proxy readout of task-level memory. Our axiomatic treatment draws on recent work on range measures, specialized here to temporal lag and extended to vector-valued outputs in the RL setting. Temporal Range thus offers a practical per-sequence readout of memory dependence for comparing agents and environments and for selecting the shortest sufficient context."}

This leaves TrustZone-based devices exposed to persistent TEE compromises. We propose Policy-Driven Runtime Integrity Measurement and Attestation (PDRIMA), a runtime integrity protection approach for TrustZone-based TEEs. PDRIMA systematically analyzes TEE attack surfaces and introduces two in-TEE subsystems: a Secure Monitor Agent (SMA) that performs policy-driven measurement, appraisal, logging, and time-based re-measurement over the TEE kernel, static components, user-TAs, and security-critical system calls; and a Remote Attestation Agent (RAA) that aggregates tamper-evident evidence and exposes a remote attestation protocol for verifying. We analyze PDRIMA's security against identified attack surfaces, implement a prototype on OP-TEE for Raspberry Pi 3B+, and evaluate its performance overhead to indicate its practicability."}

Yet current evaluation practice, reporting a single accuracy number from a single run, obscures the variance underlying these results, making it impossible to distinguish genuine capability improvements from lucky sampling. We propose adopting Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), a metric from measurement science, to characterize this variance. ICC decomposes observed variance into between-query variance (task difficulty) and within-query variance (agent inconsistency), highlighting whether reported results reflect true capability or measurement noise. We evaluated on GAIA (Levels 1-3, measuring agentic capabilities across varying reasoning complexity) and FRAMES (measuring retrieval and factuality across multiple documents). We found that ICC varies dramatically with task structure, with reasoning and retrieval tasks (FRAMES) exhibit ICC=0.4955-0.7118 across models, and agentic tasks (GAIA) exhibiting ICC=0.304-0.774 across models. For sub-agent replacement decisions in agentic systems, accuracy improvements are only trustworthy if ICC also improves. We demonstrate that ICC converges by n=8-16 trials for structured tasks and n>=32 for complex reasoning, enabling practitioners to set evidence-based resampling budgets. We recommend reporting accuracy alongside ICC and within-query variance as standard practice, and propose updated Evaluation Cards capturing these metrics. By making evaluation stability visible, we aim to transform agentic benchmarking from opaque leaderboard competition to trustworthy experimental science.

This research introduces a reinforcement learning technique to learn switching thresholds between two orthogonal navigation policies. Using maze navigation as a case study, this work demonstrates how an agent can dynamically transition between systematic exploration (coverage) and goal-directed pathfinding (convergence) to improve task performance. Unlike fixed-threshold approaches, the agent uses Q-learning to adapt switching behavior based on coverage percentage and distance to goal, requiring only minimal domain knowledge: maze dimensions and target location. The agent does not require prior knowledge of wall positions, optimal threshold values, or hand-crafted heuristics; instead, it discovers effective switching strategies dynamically during each run. The agent discretizes its state space into coverage and distance buckets, then adapts which coverage threshold (20-60\\%) to apply based on observed progress signals. Experiments across 240 test configurations (4 maze sizes from 16$\\times$16 to 128$\\times$128 $\\times$ 10 unique mazes $\\times$ 6 agent variants) demonstrate that adaptive threshold learning outperforms both single-strategy agents and fixed 40\\% threshold baselines.

However, this autonomy creates a largely overlooked security gap. Existing defenses focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded in tool metadata, leaving MCP-based systems exposed to semantic manipulation. This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior. To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime. Through evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, we find that security performance varies widely by model architecture and reasoning method. GPT-4 blocks about 71 percent of unsafe tool calls, balancing latency and safety. DeepSeek shows the highest resilience to Shadowing attacks but with greater latency, while Llama-3.5 is fastest but least robust. Our results show that the proposed framework reduces unsafe tool invocation rates without model fine-tuning or internal modification."}

These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated \"Intent Graph\"; and (ii) an innovative \"Tiered Adjudicator\" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off."}

Although they can enable the learning of complex intelligent behaviors, such task accessories can result in unnatural task setups and hinder long-term performance in the real world. In this work, we explore the challenges of learning without episode terminations and robot embodiment resets using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. To learn without terminations, we present a continuing version of the SAC algorithm and show that, with simple modifications to the reward functions of existing tasks, continuing SAC can perform as well as or better than episodic SAC while reducing the sensitivity of performance to the value of the discount rate $γ$. On a modified Gym Reacher task, we investigate possible explanations for the failure of continuing SAC when learning without embodiment resets. Our results suggest that embodiment resets help with exploration of the state space in the SAC algorithm, and removing embodiment resets can lead to poor exploration of the state space and failure of or significantly slower learning. Finally, on additional simulated tasks and a real-robot vision task, we show that increasing the entropy of the policy when performance trends worse or remains static is an effective intervention for recovering the performance lost due to not using embodiment resets."}

In response, the field has seen a rapid architectural evolution from single-model helpers toward tool-augmented agents, distributed multi-agent systems, schema-bound tool ecosystems, and early explorations of semi-autonomous investigative pipelines. This survey presents a five-generation taxonomy of agentic AI in cybersecurity. It traces how capabilities and risks change as systems advance from text-only LLM reasoners to multi-agent collaboration frameworks and constrained-autonomy pipelines. We compare these generations across core dimensions - reasoning depth, tool use, memory, reproducibility, and safety. In addition, we also synthesize emerging benchmarks used to evaluate cyber-oriented agents. Finally, we outline the unresolved challenges that accompany this evolution, such as response validation, tool-use correctness, multi-agent coordination, long-horizon reasoning, and safeguards for high-impact actions.

This paper introduces Networked RMAB, a novel framework that integrates the RMAB model with the independent cascade model to capture interactions between arms in networked environments. We define the Bellman equation for networked RMAB and present its computational challenge due to exponentially large action and state spaces. To resolve the computational challenge, we establish the submodularity of Bellman equation and apply the hill-climbing algorithm to achieve a $1-\\frac{1}{e}$ approximation guarantee in Bellman updates. Lastly, we prove that the approximate Bellman updates are guaranteed to converge by a modified contraction analysis. We experimentally verify these results by developing an efficient Q-learning algorithm tailored to the networked setting. Experimental results on real-world graph data demonstrate that our Q-learning approach outperforms both $k$-step look-ahead and network-blind approaches, highlighting the importance of capturing and leveraging network effects where they exist."}

Moreover, directly migrating these frameworks to local small-scale models (LSMs) offers a suboptimal solution with catastrophic collapse in utility based on our core findings. Our work argues that this failure stems not merely from the capability deficits of LSMs, but from the inherent irrationality of the greedy adversarial strategies employed by current state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. We model the anonymization process as a trade-off between Marginal Privacy Gain (MPG) and Marginal Utility Cost (MUC), and demonstrate that greedy strategies inevitably drift into an irrational state. To address this, we propose Rational Localized Adversarial Anonymization (RLAA), a fully localized and training-free framework featuring an Attacker-Arbitrator-Anonymizer (A-A-A) architecture. RLAA introduces an arbitrator that acts as a rationality gatekeeper, validating the attacker's inference to filter out feedback providing negligible benefits on privacy preservation. This mechanism enforces a rational early-stopping criterion, and systematically prevents utility collapse. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that RLAA achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, and in some cases even outperforms SoTA on the Pareto principle.

The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step. However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task. To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans). For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging. Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses. DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials. These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Temporal evolution is captured via fractional stochastic differential operators embedded within graph-based recurrent networks, enabling the modeling of long-term dependencies and stochastic fluctuations in network dynamics. Attention mechanisms fuse multimodal information and generate interpretable biomarkers, including network energy entropy, graph curvature, fractional memory indices, and modality-specific attention scores. These biomarkers are combined into a composite prognostic index to quantify individual risk of network instability or cognitive decline.

It is fundamentally challenging to establish trust for unpredictable AI agents and to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) when instructions are ambiguous. Despite the escalating threat landscape, the academic community's understanding of this emerging domain remains fragmented, lacking a systematic framework to analyze its root causes.

This project develops an AI system offering the only end-to-end solution by aiding doctors with both diagnosis and treatment planning. In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target. If not, a feedback loop using proximal policy optimization iterates over this system until an optimal resection location is identified. When compared to existing solutions, this project found 3 key findings: (1) Using a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 small diagnostic models reduced computing costs by 22.28x, (2) Transformers regression capabilities decreased tumor progression inference time by 113 hours, and (3) Applying Augmentations resembling Real-life situations improved overall DICE scores by 2.9%.

It is built on two core idea: 1) Embedding vibration time series into multiple mode-wise latent feature vectors to capture diverse fault-related patterns; 2) Leveraging neural factorization principles to fuse these vectors into a unified vibration representation. This design enables effective mining of complex latent fault characteristics from raw time-series data. We further instantiate the framework with two models CP-NFC and Tucker-NFC based on CP and Tucker fusion schemes, respectively.

Submitted to AMIA 2026 Informatics Summit Student Paper Track", "summary": "Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of rehospitalization among older adults in the United States. Although clinical notes contain rich, detailed patient information and make up a large portion of electronic health records (EHRs), they remain underutilized for HF readmission risk analysis. Traditional computational models for HF readmission often rely on expert-crafted rules, medical thesauri, and ontologies to interpret clinical notes, which are typically written under time pressure and may contain misspellings, abbreviations, and domain-specific jargon. We present ClinNoteAgents, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that transforms free-text clinical notes into (1) structured representations of clinical and social risk factors for association analysis and (2) clinician-style abstractions for HF 30-day readmission prediction. We evaluate ClinNoteAgents on 3,544 notes from 2,065 patients (readmission rate=35.16%), demonstrating strong performance in extracting risk factors from free-text, identifying key contributing factors, and predicting readmission risk. By reducing reliance on structured fields and minimizing manual annotation and model training, ClinNoteAgents provides a scalable and interpretable approach to note-based HF readmission risk modeling in data-limited healthcare systems."}

A key component of trust is explainability, yet much of the work in Explainable RL (XRL) focuses on local, single-step decisions. This paper addresses the critical need for explaining an agent's long-term behavior through trajectory-level analysis. We introduce a novel framework that ranks entire trajectories by defining and aggregating a new state-importance metric. This metric combines the classic Q-value difference with a \"radical term\" that captures the agent's affinity to reach its goal, providing a more nuanced measure of state criticality. We demonstrate that our method successfully identifies optimal trajectories from a heterogeneous collection of agent experiences. Furthermore, by generating counterfactual rollouts from critical states within these trajectories, we show that the agent's chosen path is robustly superior to alternatives, thereby providing a powerful \"Why this, and not that?\" explanation. Our experiments in standard OpenAI Gym environments validate that our proposed importance metric is more effective at identifying optimal behaviors compared to classic approaches, offering a significant step towards trustworthy autonomous systems."}

In offline RL, data providers share pre-collected datasets -- either as individual transitions or sequences of transitions forming trajectories -- to enable the training of RL models (also called agents) without direct interaction with the environments. Offline RL saves interactions with environments compared to traditional RL, and has been effective in critical areas, such as navigation tasks. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy leakage from offline RL datasets have emerged.\n  To safeguard private information in offline RL datasets, we propose the first differential privacy (DP) offline dataset synthesis method, PrivORL, which leverages a diffusion model and diffusion transformer to synthesize transitions and trajectories, respectively, under DP. The synthetic dataset can then be securely released for downstream analysis and research. PrivORL adopts the popular approach of pre-training a synthesizer on public datasets, and then fine-tuning on sensitive datasets using DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Additionally, PrivORL introduces curiosity-driven pre-training, which uses feedback from the curiosity module to diversify the synthetic dataset and thus can generate diverse synthetic transitions and trajectories that closely resemble the sensitive dataset. Extensive experiments on five sensitive offline RL datasets show that our method achieves better utility and fidelity in both DP transition and trajectory synthesis compared to baselines. The replication package is available at the GitHub repository."}

They lack runtime introspection, cannot diagnose their own failure modes, and do not improve over time without human intervention. In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability. We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution. VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures. From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline. Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise. In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan. This demonstrates meta level self repair in a deployed agent runtime."}

Existing NAS methods overlook useful side information from the intermediate outputs of these modules -- such as their representation quality -- limiting sample efficiency in multi-source RL settings. To address this, we propose an LLM-driven NAS pipeline that leverages language-model priors and intermediate-output signals to guide sample-efficient search for high-performing composite state encoders. On a mixed-autonomy traffic control task, our approach discovers higher-performing architectures with fewer candidate evaluations than traditional NAS baselines and the LLM-based GENIUS framework."}

However, SOTA reasoning LLMs are typically ultra-large, closed-source, or have limited performance in vulnerability detection. To address this, we propose a novel training recipe with specialized data selection, reasoning data generation, reasoning data filtering and correction, and testing-phase optimization. Using our proposed methodology, we train a reasoning model with seven billion parameters. Through extensive experiments on SOTA datasets across Python, C/C++, and Java, we show that VulnLLM-R has superior effectiveness and efficiency than SOTA static analysis tools and both open-source and commercial large reasoning models. We further conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in our training recipe. Finally, we construct an agent scaffold around our model and show that it outperforms CodeQL and AFL++ in real-world projects. Our agent further discovers a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in actively maintained repositories.

Our curriculum analysis reveals 35.3% of tasks exhibit low neural affinity for Transformers--a distributional bias mirroring ARC-AGI-2. To probe this misalignment, we fine-tuned a 1.7M-parameter Transformer across 302 tasks, revealing a profound Compositional Gap: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%) achieve >80% cell accuracy (local patterns) but <10% grid accuracy (global synthesis). This provides direct evidence for a Neural Affinity Ceiling Effect, where performance is bounded by architectural suitability, not curriculum. Applying our framework to Li et al.'s independent ViTARC study (400 specialists, 1M examples each) confirms its predictive power: Very Low affinity tasks achieve 51.9% versus 77.7% for High affinity (p<0.001), with a task at 0% despite massive data.

In this paper, we introduce OXtal, a large-scale 100M parameter all-atom diffusion model that directly learns the conditional joint distribution over intramolecular conformations and periodic packing. To efficiently scale OXtal, we abandon explicit equivariant architectures imposing inductive bias arising from crystal symmetries in favor of data augmentation strategies. We further propose a novel crystallization-inspired lattice-free training scheme, Stoichiometric Stochastic Shell Sampling ($S^4$), that efficiently captures long-range interactions while sidestepping explicit lattice parametrization -- thus enabling more scalable architectural choices at all-atom resolution. By leveraging a large dataset of 600K experimentally validated crystal structures (including rigid and flexible molecules, co-crystals, and solvates), OXtal achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements over prior ab initio machine learning CSP methods, while remaining orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional quantum-chemical approaches.

Deciphering these networks is critical for understanding health and disease, yet their scale and complexity represent a daunting challenge for current computational methods. Traditional biological network analysis methods, including deep learning approaches, while powerful, face inherent challenges such as limited scalability, oversmoothing long-range dependencies, difficulty in multimodal integration, expressivity bounds, and poor interpretability. We present Graph2Image, a framework that transforms large biological networks into sets of two-dimensional images by spatially arranging representative network nodes on a 2D grid. This transformation decouples the nodes as images, enabling the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with global receptive fields and multi-scale pyramids, thus overcoming limitations of existing biological network analysis methods in scalability, memory efficiency, and long-range context capture. Graph2Image also facilitates seamless integration with other imaging and omics modalities and enhances interpretability through direct visualization of node-associated images. When applied to several large-scale biological network datasets, Graph2Image improved classification accuracy by up to 67.2% over existing methods and provided interpretable visualizations that revealed biologically coherent patterns. It also allows analysis of very large biological networks (nodes > 1 billion) on a personal computer. Graph2Image thus provides a scalable, interpretable, and multimodal-ready approach for biological network analysis, offering new opportunities for disease diagnosis and the study of complex biological systems."}

The principal contribution is offered as an end-to-end architectural blueprint and vision for an AI-driven deception platform. Feasibility is evidenced by a functional prototype of the central decision mechanism, in which a reinforcement learning (RL) agent determines, in real time, when sessions should be escalated from low-interaction sensor nodes to dynamically provisioned, high-interaction honeypots.

A Qualitative Analysis of Success and Failure Scenarios of Various LLMs in Agentic Simulations", "comment": "48 pages, 3 tables, 2 listings", "summary": "We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when operating as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities. Using the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, we analyze 900 execution traces from three representative models - Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek V3.1 - across filesystem, text extraction, CSV analysis, and SQL scenarios. Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data."}

These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated \"Intent Graph\"; and (ii) an innovative \"Tiered Adjudicator\" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off."}

However, state-of-the-art methods of drawing these tickets, like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), are computationally prohibitive, while more efficient saliency-based Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) techniques suffer from a significant accuracy-sparsity trade-off and fail basic sanity checks. In this work, we argue that PaI's reliance on first-order saliency metrics, which ignore inter-weight dependencies, contributes substantially to this performance gap, especially in the sparse regime. To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes. CTS's subnetworks outperform saliency-based methods across all sparsities, but its advantage over LTR is most pronounced in the highly sparse regime."}

While diffusion models demonstrate exceptional performance in generation tasks, their application to TSF remains largely confined to modeling single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the abundant cross-modal signals inherent in complex heterogeneous data. To address this gap, we propose UniDiff, a unified diffusion framework for multimodal time series forecasting. To process the numerical sequence, our framework first tokenizes the time series into patches, preserving local temporal dynamics by mapping each patch to an embedding space via a lightweight MLP. At its core lies a unified and parallel fusion module, where a single cross-attention mechanism adaptively weighs and integrates structural information from timestamps and semantic context from texts in one step, enabling a flexible and efficient interplay between modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism designed for multi-source conditioning, allowing for decoupled control over the guidance strength of textual and temporal information during inference, which significantly enhances model robustness. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed UniDiff model achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($α$) and biological ($β$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression."}

However, the data-based pattern makes related algorithms learn and even exacerbate potential bias in samples, resulting in discriminatory decisions against certain unprivileged groups, depriving them of the rights to equal treatment, thus damaging the social well-being and hindering the development of related applications. Therefore, we propose a pre-processing method IFFair based on the influence function. Compared with other fairness optimization approaches, IFFair only uses the influence disparity of training samples on different groups as a guidance to dynamically adjust the sample weights during training without modifying the network structure, data features and decision boundaries. To evaluate the validity of IFFair, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets and metrics. The experimental results show that our approach mitigates bias of multiple accepted metrics in the classification setting, including demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity and error rate parity without conflicts. It also demonstrates that IFFair achieves better trade-off between multiple utility and fairness metrics compared with previous pre-processing methods."}

We propose \\emph{Temporal Range}, a model-agnostic metric that treats first-order sensitivities of multiple vector outputs across a temporal window to the input sequence as a temporal influence profile and summarizes it by the magnitude-weighted average lag. Temporal Range is computed via reverse-mode automatic differentiation from the Jacobian blocks $\\partial y_s/\\partial x_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{c\\times d}$ averaged over final timesteps $s\\in\\{t+1,\\dots,T\\}$ and is well-characterized in the linear setting by a small set of natural axioms. Across diagnostic and control tasks (POPGym; flicker/occlusion; Copy-$k$) and architectures (MLPs, RNNs, SSMs), Temporal Range (i) remains small in fully observed control, (ii) scales with the task's ground-truth lag in Copy-$k$, and (iii) aligns with the minimum history window required for near-optimal return as confirmed by window ablations. We also report Temporal Range for a compact Long Expressive Memory (LEM) policy trained on the task, using it as a proxy readout of task-level memory. Our axiomatic treatment draws on recent work on range measures, specialized here to temporal lag and extended to vector-valued outputs in the RL setting. Temporal Range thus offers a practical per-sequence readout of memory dependence for comparing agents and environments and for selecting the shortest sufficient context."}

It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer."}

This paper introduces Networked RMAB, a novel framework that integrates the RMAB model with the independent cascade model to capture interactions between arms in networked environments. We define the Bellman equation for networked RMAB and present its computational challenge due to exponentially large action and state spaces. To resolve the computational challenge, we establish the submodularity of Bellman equation and apply the hill-climbing algorithm to achieve a $1-\\frac{1}{e}$ approximation guarantee in Bellman updates. Lastly, we prove that the approximate Bellman updates are guaranteed to converge by a modified contraction analysis. We experimentally verify these results by developing an efficient Q-learning algorithm tailored to the networked setting. Experimental results on real-world graph data demonstrate that our Q-learning approach outperforms both $k$-step look-ahead and network-blind approaches, highlighting the importance of capturing and leveraging network effects where they exist."}

In this work, we introduce LoRA-based Unlearning with Negative Examples (LUNE), a lightweight framework that performs negative-only unlearning by updating only low-rank adapters while freezing the backbone, thereby localizing edits and avoiding disruptive global changes. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), LUNE targets intermediate representations to suppress (or replace) requested knowledge with an order-of-magnitude lower compute and memory than full fine-tuning or direct weight editing.

Conventional traffic management strategies, including route guidance, ramp metering, and traffic signal control, often rely on state feedback controllers, used for their simplicity and reactivity; however, they lack the adaptability required to cope with complex and time-varying traffic dynamics. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which each agent adaptively tunes the parameters of a state feedback traffic controller, combining the reactivity of state feedback controllers with the adaptability of reinforcement learning. By tuning parameters at a lower frequency rather than directly determining control actions at a high frequency, the reinforcement learning agents achieve improved training efficiency while maintaining adaptability to varying traffic conditions. The multi-agent structure further enhances system robustness, as local controllers can operate independently in the event of partial failures. The proposed framework is evaluated on a simulated multi-class transportation network under varying traffic conditions. Results show that the proposed multi-agent framework outperforms the no control and fixed-parameter state feedback control cases, while performing on par with the single-agent RL-based adaptive state feedback control, with a much better resilience to partial failures."}

Our analysis centers on Comet, an AI-powered browser developed by Perplexity, and its integrated agent, Comet Assistant. Drawing on hundreds of millions of anonymized user interactions, we address three fundamental questions: Who is using AI agents? How intensively are they using them? And what are they using them for? Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in adoption and usage across user segments. Earlier adopters, users in countries with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment, and individuals working in digital or knowledge-intensive sectors -- such as digital technology, academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship -- are more likely to adopt or actively use the agent. To systematically characterize the substance of agent usage, we introduce a hierarchical agentic taxonomy that organizes use cases across three levels: topic, subtopic, and task. The two largest topics, Productivity & Workflow and Learning & Research, account for 57% of all agentic queries, while the two largest subtopics, Courses and Shopping for Goods, make up 22%. The top 10 out of 90 tasks represent 55% of queries. Personal use constitutes 55% of queries, while professional and educational contexts comprise 30% and 16%, respectively.

However, this autonomy creates a largely overlooked security gap. Existing defenses focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded in tool metadata, leaving MCP-based systems exposed to semantic manipulation. This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior. To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime. Through evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, we find that security performance varies widely by model architecture and reasoning method. GPT-4 blocks about 71 percent of unsafe tool calls, balancing latency and safety. DeepSeek shows the highest resilience to Shadowing attacks but with greater latency, while Llama-3.5 is fastest but least robust. Our results show that the proposed framework reduces unsafe tool invocation rates without model fine-tuning or internal modification."}

It is fundamentally challenging to establish trust for unpredictable AI agents and to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) when instructions are ambiguous. Despite the escalating threat landscape, the academic community's understanding of this emerging domain remains fragmented, lacking a systematic framework to analyze its root causes.

To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes. CTS's subnetworks outperform saliency-based methods across all sparsities, but its advantage over LTR is most pronounced in the highly sparse regime."}

Laird", "Corey Clark"], "title": "On Memory: A comparison of memory mechanisms in world models", "comment": "10 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "World models enable agents to plan within imagined environments by predicting future states conditioned on past observations and actions. However, their ability to plan over long horizons is limited by the effective memory span of the backbone architecture. This limitation leads to perceptual drift in long rollouts, hindering the model's capacity to perform loop closures within imagined trajectories. In this work, we investigate the effective memory span of transformer-based world models through an analysis of several memory augmentation mechanisms. We introduce a taxonomy that distinguishes between memory encoding and memory injection mechanisms, motivating their roles in extending the world model's memory through the lens of residual stream dynamics. Using a state recall evaluation task, we measure the memory recall of each mechanism and analyze its respective trade-offs. Our findings show that memory mechanisms improve the effective memory span in vision transformers and provide a path to completing loop closures within a world model's imagination."}

However, the data-based pattern makes related algorithms learn and even exacerbate potential bias in samples, resulting in discriminatory decisions against certain unprivileged groups, depriving them of the rights to equal treatment, thus damaging the social well-being and hindering the development of related applications. Therefore, we propose a pre-processing method IFFair based on the influence function. Compared with other fairness optimization approaches, IFFair only uses the influence disparity of training samples on different groups as a guidance to dynamically adjust the sample weights during training without modifying the network structure, data features and decision boundaries. To evaluate the validity of IFFair, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets and metrics. The experimental results show that our approach mitigates bias of multiple accepted metrics in the classification setting, including demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity and error rate parity without conflicts. It also demonstrates that IFFair achieves better trade-off between multiple utility and fairness metrics compared with previous pre-processing methods."}

We prove the taxonomy's visual coherence by training a CNN on raw grid pixels (95.24% accuracy on S3, 36.25% overall, 3.3x chance), then apply the taxonomy diagnostically to the original ARC-AGI-2 test set. Our curriculum analysis reveals 35.3% of tasks exhibit low neural affinity for Transformers--a distributional bias mirroring ARC-AGI-2. To probe this misalignment, we fine-tuned a 1.7M-parameter Transformer across 302 tasks, revealing a profound Compositional Gap: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%) achieve >80% cell accuracy (local patterns) but <10% grid accuracy (global synthesis). This provides direct evidence for a Neural Affinity Ceiling Effect, where performance is bounded by architectural suitability, not curriculum. Applying our framework to Li et al.'s independent ViTARC study (400 specialists, 1M examples each) confirms its predictive power: Very Low affinity tasks achieve 51.9% versus 77.7% for High affinity (p<0.001), with a task at 0% despite massive data. The taxonomy enables precise diagnosis: low-affinity tasks (A2) hit hard ceilings, while high-affinity tasks (C1) reach 99.8%. These findings indicate that progress requires hybrid architectures with affinity-aligned modules. We release our validated taxonomy,"}

It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer."}

In offline RL, data providers share pre-collected datasets -- either as individual transitions or sequences of transitions forming trajectories -- to enable the training of RL models (also called agents) without direct interaction with the environments. Offline RL saves interactions with environments compared to traditional RL, and has been effective in critical areas, such as navigation tasks. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy leakage from offline RL datasets have emerged.\n  To safeguard private information in offline RL datasets, we propose the first differential privacy (DP) offline dataset synthesis method, PrivORL, which leverages a diffusion model and diffusion transformer to synthesize transitions and trajectories, respectively, under DP. The synthetic dataset can then be securely released for downstream analysis and research. PrivORL adopts the popular approach of pre-training a synthesizer on public datasets, and then fine-tuning on sensitive datasets using DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Additionally, PrivORL introduces curiosity-driven pre-training, which uses feedback from the curiosity module to diversify the synthetic dataset and thus can generate diverse synthetic transitions and trajectories that closely resemble the sensitive dataset. Extensive experiments on five sensitive offline RL datasets show that our method achieves better utility and fidelity in both DP transition and trajectory synthesis compared to baselines. The replication package is available at the GitHub repository."}

Our key insight is that LLMs can reason about program states and analyze the potential vulnerabilities, rather than simple pattern matching. This can improve the model's generalizability and prevent learning shortcuts. However, SOTA reasoning LLMs are typically ultra-large, closed-source, or have limited performance in vulnerability detection. To address this, we propose a novel training recipe with specialized data selection, reasoning data generation, reasoning data filtering and correction, and testing-phase optimization. Using our proposed methodology, we train a reasoning model with seven billion parameters. Through extensive experiments on SOTA datasets across Python, C/C++, and Java, we show that VulnLLM-R has superior effectiveness and efficiency than SOTA static analysis tools and both open-source and commercial large reasoning models. We further conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in our training recipe. Finally, we construct an agent scaffold around our model and show that it outperforms CodeQL and AFL++ in real-world projects. Our agent further discovers a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in actively maintained repositories. This work represents a pioneering effort to enable real-world, project-level vulnerability detection using AI agents powered by specialized reasoning models.

We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints.

We prove that $\\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds.

The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens. \\"}

In this work, ADLAH is introduced: an Adaptive Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Honeynet designed to maximize high-fidelity threat intelligence while minimizing cost through autonomous orchestration of infrastructure. The principal contribution is offered as an end-to-end architectural blueprint and vision for an AI-driven deception platform. Feasibility is evidenced by a functional prototype of the central decision mechanism, in which a reinforcement learning (RL) agent determines, in real time, when sessions should be escalated from low-interaction sensor nodes to dynamically provisioned, high-interaction honeypots. Because sufficient live data were unavailable, field-scale validation is not claimed; instead, design trade-offs and limitations are detailed, and a rigorous roadmap toward empirical evaluation at scale is provided. Beyond selective escalation and anomaly detection, the architecture pursues automated extraction, clustering, and versioning of bot attack chains, a core capability motivated by the empirical observation that exposed services are dominated by automated traffic. Together, these elements delineate a practical path toward cost-efficient capture of high-value adversary behavior, systematic bot versioning, and the production of actionable threat intelligence."}
