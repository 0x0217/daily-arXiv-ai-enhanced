While inbound phishing\ndefenses have improved significantly, most organizations still trust internal\nemails by default, leaving themselves vulnerable to attacks from compromised\nemployee accounts. In this work, we define and explore the problem of\nauthorship validation: verifying whether a claimed sender actually authored a\ngiven email. Authorship validation is a lightweight, real-time defense that\ncomplements traditional detection methods by modeling per-sender writing style.\nFurther, the paper presents a collection of new datasets based on the Enron\ncorpus. These simulate inauthentic messages using both human-written and large\nlanguage model-generated emails. The paper also evaluates two classifiers -- a\nNaive Bayes model and a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN)\n-- for the authorship validation task. Our experiments show that the Char-CNN\nmodel achieves high accuracy and F1 scores under various circumstances.\nFinally, we discuss deployment considerations and show that per-sender\nauthorship classifiers are practical for integrating into existing commercial\nemail security systems with low overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \ubc1c\uc1a1\uc790\uc758 \uc9c4\uc704 \ud655\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uc800\uc790 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \uc0ac\uae30 \ubc0f \uce21\uba74 \ud53c\uc2f1 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc870\uc9c1\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uac00 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc800\uc790 \uac80\uc99d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc800\uc790 \uac80\uc99d\uc740 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \ubc1c\uc1a1\uc790\uc758 \uae00\uc4f0\uae30 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub85c, \uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c Enron \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Char-CNN \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac01 \ubc1c\uc1a1\uc790\ubcc4 \uc800\uc790 \uac80\uc99d \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc0c1\uc6a9 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc27d\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub0ae\uc740 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \uc0ac\uae30\uc640 \uce21\uba74 \ud53c\uc2f1 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc870\uc9c1\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uac00\uc7a5 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ud30c\uad34\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc678\ubd80 \ud53c\uc2f1 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc870\uc9c1\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud558\uc5ec \uc190\uc0c1\ub41c \uc9c1\uc6d0 \uacc4\uc815\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc800\uc790 \ud655\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc8fc\uc7a5\ub41c \ubc1c\uc2e0\uc790\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc744 \uc791\uc131\ud588\ub294\uc9c0 \ud655\uc778\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc800\uc790 \uac80\uc99d\uc740 \ubc1c\uc1a1\uc790\ubcc4 \uae00\uc4f0\uae30 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc791\uc131\ud55c \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uacfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 Enron \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc800\uc790 \uac80\uc99d \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub098\uc774\ube0c \ubca0\uc774\uc988 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ubb38\uc790 \uc218\uc900 \ud569\uc131\uacf1 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(Char-CNN)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc Char-CNN \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \ubc30\ud3ec \uace0\ub824\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \ubc1c\uc1a1\uc790\ubcc4 \uc800\uc790 \uac80\uc99d \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uac00 \uae30\uc874 \uc0c1\uc6a9 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Labeled as electromagnetic\nemanations, they form an EM side-channel for data leakage. Previously, it was\nbelieved that such leakage could be contained within a facility since they are\nweak signals with a short transmission range. However, in the preliminary\nversion of this work [1], we found that the traditional cable repairing process\nforms a tiny monopole antenna that helps emanations transmit over a long range.\nExperimentation with three types of cables revealed that emanations from\nrepaired cables remain detectable even at >4 m and can penetrate a 14 cm thick\nconcrete wall. In this extended version, we show that such emanation can be\nexploited at a long distance for information extraction by detecting keystrokes\ntyped on a repaired USB keyboard. By collecting data for 70 different\nkeystrokes at different distances from the target in 3 diverse environments\n(open space, a corridor outside an office room, and outside a building) and\ndeveloping an efficient detection algorithm, ~100% keystroke detection accuracy\nhas been achieved up to 12 m distance, which is the highest reported accuracy\nat such a long range for USB keyboards in the literature. The effect of two\nexperimental factors, interference and human-body coupling, has been\ninvestigated thoroughly. Along with exploring the vulnerability, multi-layer\nexternal metal shielding during the repairing process as a possible remedy has\nbeen explored.

In this paper, we\npresent a systematic comparative analysis of four representative\napproaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:\nperformance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive\nevaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that\nYOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited\ntransparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical\ninterpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in\nour experiments.

In this work, we propose a novel\nmethodology that combines ontology-driven structured outputs with Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that\nimproves the accuracy and explainability of information extraction from\ncybersecurity logs. Central to our approach is the integration of domain\nontologies and SHACL-based constraints to guide the language model's output\nstructure and enforce semantic validity over the resulting graph. Extracted\ninformation is organized into an ontology-enriched graph database, enabling\nfuture semantic analysis and querying. The design of our methodology is\nmotivated by the analytical requirements associated with honeypot log data,\nwhich typically comprises predominantly malicious activity. While our case\nstudy illustrates the relevance of this scenario, the experimental evaluation\nis conducted using publicly available datasets.

Recent studies\nshow adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent\nrepresentations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task\nlearning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while\nenabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy\nthreats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple\nyet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time\nthrough fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt\nembedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,\nChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task\nperformance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,\noutperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.\nAblations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future\ndirections. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data\nlake-trained models and centralized federated learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud638\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc644\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uac74\uac15 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc720\ucd9c\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc218\ucd9c\ud560 \ub54c \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uce35\ubcc4 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DermaMNIST, ChestMNIST \ubc0f MIMIC-CXR\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc720\ucd9c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc29\ud574\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0, \uc720\ucd9c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud638\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\ud654\ub41c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud638\uc218\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uac00\uce58\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf4\ud638\ub418\ub294 \uac74\uac15 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ub204\ucd9c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uc704\ud5d8\ub3c4 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \uc801\ub300\uc790\uac00 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ud0a4\uac70\ub098 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc554\uae30\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc720\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ucc98\ub7fc \uc704\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubc95\uc801 \ubc0f \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uce35\ubcc4 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc218\ucd9c \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc27d\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc644\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We present an\nempirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize\nresearch-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal\nstructure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge\ncutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model\nrepresented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643\nmulti-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified\nover 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.\nOur results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near\nknowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release\ndates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal\nstudies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly\nretrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step\nreasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that\ngoes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation\nstrategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and\ndataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that\nprioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply\ncollecting newly

However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer\nfrom accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces\ncumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction\nobjectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)\nprovides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs\nprohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address\nthese challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT\nframework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the\nneed for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory\noverhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,\nZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and\nequivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation\noutliers.

This paper addresses one of the key challenges to MARL, the\ncomplexity of simultaneous training of agents in nontrivial environments, and\npresents a novel policy-based Nash Q-learning to directly converge onto a\nsteady equilibrium. We demonstrate the successful implementation of this\nalgorithm in a notable complex cyber defense simulation treated as a two-player\nzero-sum Markov game setting. We propose the Nash Q-Network, which aims to\nlearn Nash-optimal strategies that translate to robust defenses in\ncybersecurity settings. Our approach incorporates aspects of proximal policy\noptimization (PPO), deep Q-network (DQN), and the Nash-Q algorithm, addressing\ncommon challenges like non-stationarity and instability in multi-agent\nlearning.

While prompt-based\ndetection offers a lightweight and interpretable defense strategy, its\neffectiveness has been hindered by the need for manual prompt engineering. To\naddress this issue, we propose AEGIS , an Automated co-Evolutionary framework\nfor Guarding prompt Injections Schema. Both attack and defense prompts are\niteratively optimized against each other using a gradient-like natural language\nprompt optimization technique. This framework enables both attackers and\ndefenders to autonomously evolve via a Textual Gradient Optimization (TGO)\nmodule, leveraging feedback from an LLM-guided evaluation loop. We evaluate our\nsystem on a real-world assignment grading dataset of prompt injection attacks\nand demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines,\nachieving superior robustness in both attack success and detection.\nSpecifically, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 1.0, representing an\nimprovement of 0.26 over the baseline. For detection, the true positive rate\n(TPR) improves by 0.23 compared to the previous best work, reaching 0.84, and\nthe true negative rate (TNR) remains comparable at 0.89. Ablation studies\nconfirm the importance of co-evolution, gradient buffering, and multi-objective\noptimization.

This\nstudy introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data\ncollected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag\nflow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional\nneural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and\nbenchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.\nThe proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from\naccelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a\nrealistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid\nconvolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when\ncombined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data\nloading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming\ntraditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10\n+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial\nrelevance.

It constructs a controller to provide feedback and\ncontrol to the system, ensuring it meets specified control specifications.\nTraditional controller synthesis methods often use formal languages to describe\ncontrol specifications and are mainly oriented towards single-agent and\nnon-probabilistic systems. With the increasing complexity of systems, the\ncontrol requirements that need to be satisfied also become more complex. Based\non this, this paper proposes a controller synthesis method for semi-cooperative\nsemi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems to solve the\ncontroller synthesis problem based on temporal logic specifications.

However, developing\nminimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology\nnodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship\nbetween process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the\n16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced\n5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features\nderived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained\ncharacterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the\n5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 5nm \uae30\uc220 \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc791\ub3d9 \uc804\uc555 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc18\ub3c4\uccb4 \uc81c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uce69 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "16nm \uae30\uc220 \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub808\uac70\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 5nm \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "5nm \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc758 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc628\uce69 \uc2e4\ub9ac\ucf58 \uc624\ub3c4\ubbf8\ud130 \uc13c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uce69 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ubc18\ub3c4\uccb4 \uc81c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uace0\uae09 \uae30\uc220 \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc18c \uc791\ub3d9 \uc804\uc555($V_{min}$) \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uacf5\uc815 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uacfc $V_{min}$ \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad00\uacc4 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 16nm \uae30\uc220 \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub808\uac70\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uae09 5nm \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ud55c $V_{min}$ \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc740 5nm \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\uc778 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc758 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc628\uce69 \uc2e4\ub9ac\ucf58 \uc624\ub3c4\ubbf8\ud130 \uc13c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Here, agents are instantiated\nwith emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual\naccuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually\nrepresented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of\nthree classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)\ndatasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving\nneighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with\nmovement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative\nemotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,\nemotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of\nexperiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and\nscenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy\nclassifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,\nemotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By\ncontrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional\nclusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral\nscenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration\nof cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in\nemotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt\nemotional integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

We present \\textbf{ShortageSim}, the first Large Language Model\n(LLM)-based multi-agent simulation framework that captures the complex,\nstrategic interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and\nregulatory agencies in response to shortage alerts. Unlike traditional\ngame-theoretic models that assume perfect rationality and complete information,\n\\textbf{ShortageSim} leverages LLMs to simulate bounded-rational\ndecision-making under uncertainty. Through a sequential production game\nspanning multiple quarters, we model how FDA announcements, both reactive\nalerts about existing shortages and proactive warnings about potential\ndisruptions, propagate through the supply chain and influence capacity\ninvestment and procurement decisions. Our experiments on historical shortage\nevents reveal that \\textbf{ShortageSim} reduces the resolution-lag percentage\nfor discontinued-disclosed cases by 83\\%, bringing simulated durations more\naligned to ground truth than the zero-shot baseline. We open-source\n\\textbf{ShortageSim} and a dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events at\nhttps://github.com/Lemutisme/Sortage_Management, providing a novel\ncomputational framework for designing and testing interventions in complex,\ninformation-scarce supply chains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc57d\ubb3c \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc57d\ubb3c \ubd80\uc871\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc\uc640 \ubcf4\uac74 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uaddc\uc81c \uac1c\uc785\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ShortageSim\uc740 \uc57d\ubb3c \uc81c\uc870\uc5c5\uccb4, \uae30\uad00 \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790, \uaddc\uc81c \uae30\uad00 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "ShortageSim\uc740 \uc911\ub2e8\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc758 \ud574\uacb0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ube44\uc728\uc744 83% \uc904\uc600\uace0, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ud669\uacfc \ub354 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ShortageSim\uacfc FDA \ubd80\uc871 \uc0ac\uac74 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac1c\uc785 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc57d\ubb3c \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc\uc640 \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc81c\uc57d \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uaddc\uc81c \uac1c\uc785\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc57d\ubb3c \uc81c\uc870\uc5c5\uccb4, \uae30\uad00 \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790, \uaddc\uc81c \uae30\uad00 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ShortageSim\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, ShortageSim\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uae30\ub97c \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 FDA\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubd80\uc871\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc18\uc751 \uacbd\uace0\uc640 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc911\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uacbd\uace0\uac00 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc804\ud30c\ub418\uace0 \uc6a9\ub7c9 \ud22c\uc790 \ubc0f \uc870\ub2ec \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ubd80\uc871 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, ShortageSim\uc740 \uc911\ub2e8\ub41c \uc0ac\ub840\uc758 \ud574\uacb0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ube44\uc728\uc744 83% \uc904\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub41c \uae30\uac04\uc774 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc640 \ub354 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ShortageSim\uacfc 2,925\uac1c\uc758 FDA \ubd80\uc871 \uc0ac\uac74 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 https://github.com/Lemutisme/Sortage_Management\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While human users see a benign webpage, the agent is\npresented with a visually identical page embedded with hidden, malicious\ninstructions, such as indirect prompt injections. This mechanism allows\nadversaries to hijack agent behavior, leading to data exfiltration, malware\nexecution, or misinformation propagation, all while remaining completely\ninvisible to human users and conventional security crawlers.

Existing training-free acceleration methods\ntypically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their\neffectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the\nunderlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path\nSampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the\nsampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching\nform and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The\nreparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible\nvelocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The\nadaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift\nterm and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,\nrestoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely\nlow-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and\ntext-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.\nNotably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves\nsubstantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The\nadaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,\nunderscoring its generality.

This paper explores the correlations\nbetween different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies\nthe potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.\nFirstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between\nweights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract\nQuery-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the\nself-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the\nmatrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of\nsingular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the\nprobability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is\nfound that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law\ndistribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance\ncalculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative\nmethod is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different\nmodels. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution\ncharacteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian\nprocess and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate\nthe generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.\nFinally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data\ngeneration method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for\ntraining.

We present MODE (Mixture of Document\nExperts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor\nsearch with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into\nsemantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query\ntime, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those\nclusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking\nwhile keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,\nMODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while\nreducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and\nmulti-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter\nclusters improve downstream accuracy.

Our\nearlier \"Basic\" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary\nmetrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an\nalgorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This \"Advanced\" sequel fills\nthat gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to\nshow that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of\n84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only\n30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an\nAdaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises\nheterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average\nthresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.\nThird, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts\nanomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and\nreduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.\nWe present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies\nto surface missing metrics.

Recent studies have shown that GPU\nkernels are vulnerable to both traditional memory safety issues (e.g., buffer\noverflow attacks) and emerging microarchitectural threats (e.g., Rowhammer\nattacks), many of which manifest as anomalous execution behaviors observable\nthrough side-channel signals. However, existing golden model based validation\napproaches that rely on such signals are fragile, highly sensitive to\ninterference, and do not scale well across GPU workloads with diverse\nscheduling behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose ShadowScope, a\nmonitoring and validation framework that leverages a composable golden model.\nInstead of building a single monolithic reference, ShadowScope decomposes\ntrusted kernel execution into modular, repeatable functions that encode key\nbehavioral features. This composable design captures execution patterns at\nfiner granularity, enabling robust validation that is resilient to noise,\nworkload variation, and interference across GPU workloads. To further reduce\nreliance on noisy software-only monitoring, we introduce ShadowScope+, a\nhardware-assisted validation mechanism that integrates lightweight on-chip\nchecks into the GPU pipeline.

Inspired by memory consolidation in\nthe human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed\nby~\\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of\nprior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the\nmost influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their\nframework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using\nthe CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the\neffectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with\nSynaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay\nsignificantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the\ncost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory\nstability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood\ndistributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections\nreveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,\npotentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore\nthe limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions\nfor balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uacf5 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(ANN)\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc778 \ub9dd\uac01 \ub4f1\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \ub54c \uc774\uc804 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc7ac\ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc740 \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\uc18c\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ucda9 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacf5 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9dd\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "CIFAR-100 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc0f \uc2dc\ub0c5\uc2a4 \uc9c0\ub2a5(SI)\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub0b4\ubd80 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc740 \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucd08\uae30 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub1cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ub825\uacfc \uc720\uc9c0\ub825\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(ANN)\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud560 \ub54c \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4\uc778 \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc778 \ub9dd\uac01\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ub1cc\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5 \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \ud559\uc2b5 \uc911 \uc774\uc804 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc7ac\ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc740 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub1cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uc911 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc2ec\uce35\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc0ac\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \ucd08\uc810\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4. \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc99d\ubd84 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c CIFAR-100 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc758 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc0f \uc2dc\ub0c5\uc2a4 \uc9c0\ub2a5(SI)\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 SI\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucd08\uae30 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uac00\ub97c \uce58\ub978\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\uc18c\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ucda9 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub85c\uadf8 \uac00\ub2a5\ub3c4 \ubd84\ud3ec, \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uc624\ub958, \uc2e4\ub8e8\uc5e3 \uc810\uc218 \ubc0f UMAP \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc774 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uc801 \uc911\ucca9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04\uc758 \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub1cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc9c0\ub825\uacfc \uc801\uc751\ub825\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

This paper presents a hybrid de-identification\nframework designed to process Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine\n(DICOM) files. Our framework adopts a modified, pre-built rule-based component,\nupdated with The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)'s best practices guidelines, as\noutlined in DICOM PS 3.15, for improved performance. It incorporates PaddleOCR,\na robust Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for extracting text from\nimages, and RoBERTa, a fine-tuned transformer-based model for identifying and\nremoving Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health\nInformation (PHI). Initially, the transformer-based model and the rule-based\ncomponent were integrated to process for both structured data and free text.\nHowever, this coarse-grained approach did not yield optimal results. To improve\nperformance, we refined our approach by applying the transformer model\nexclusively to free text, while structured data was handled only by rule-based\nmethods.

Traditional experimental methods, while\nfoundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing\ngeological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed\nneural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to\nenhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical\nisotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency\nwhile leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting\nof 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,\nincorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.\nMulti-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex\nsorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head\nattention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for\nuncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter\noptimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)\nwith 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework\ndemonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =\n0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%\nreliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local\neffects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity\ndominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong\ninteractions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This\nadaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables\nrisk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc218\uc18c \ud761\ucc29 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(PINN) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\ud558 \uc218\uc18c \uc800\uc7a5, \uc790\uc5f0 \uc218\uc18c \ud0d0\uc0ac \ubc0f \ubc29\uc0ac\uc131 \ud3d0\uae30\ubb3c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc218\uc18c \ud761\ucc29\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud074\ub798\uc2dd \ub4f1\uc628\uc120 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5f4\uc5ed\ud559\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 PINN \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "K-\uacb9 \uad50\ucc28 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 67% \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 \uc120\ubcc4\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc704\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc810\ud1a0, \uc170\uc77c \ubc0f \uc11d\ud0c4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc218\uc18c \ud761\ucc29\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc9c0\ud558 \uc218\uc18c \uc800\uc7a5, \uc790\uc5f0 \uc218\uc18c \ud0d0\uc0ac \ubc0f \ubc29\uc0ac\uc131 \ud3d0\uae30\ubb3c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc774\uae34 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2dc\uac04 \uc18c\ubaa8\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\uace0 \uc9c0\uc9c8\uc801 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc218\uc18c \ud761\ucc29 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ud2b9\uc131 \uacf5\ud559\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(PINN) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ub4f1\uc628\uc120 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5ed\ud559\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc870\uc131 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c 155\uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 7\uac1c \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ub2e4\uc911 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ud2b9\uc131 \uacf5\ud559\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud761\ucc29 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only\nindicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular\nguidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient\nlearning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient\nsolutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To\naddress this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task\ndifficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided\nExploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to\ndynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task\ndifficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal\nto modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is\nstruggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for\neasier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.\nExperiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show\nthat DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines.

Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our fusion approach achieves a macro F1-score of 0.823 on a cross-domain\nvalidation set, significantly outperforming individual models and providing\nsuperior generalization. The framework maintains low computational overhead,\nmaking it suitable for real-time deployment, and all code and data are provided\nfor full reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uc545\uc131\ucf54\ub4dc \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc545\uc131\ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 EMBER, API Call Sequences, CIC Obfuscated Memory\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c LightGBM \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc608\uce21 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub85c \uc735\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac80\uc99d \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c 0.823\uc758 \ub9e4\ud06c\ub85c F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc545\uc131 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc9d1\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc73c\uba70 \uc885\uc885 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 EMBER(\uc815\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5), API \ud638\ucd9c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4(\ud589\ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5) \ubc0f CIC \ub09c\ub3c5\ud654 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac(\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud328\ud134)\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud655\ub960 \uc218\uc900 \uc735\ud569\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac01 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubcc4 LightGBM \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\uc704 \uc608\uce21 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uba70, \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc735\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc735\ud569 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac80\uc99d \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c 0.823\uc758 \ub9e4\ud06c\ub85c F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

Through\nanalysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and\nprocedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically\nsignificant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior\n(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research\nlooks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.\nThe deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional\nautoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network\n(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is\nused to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data\nsample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up\nto the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO\nactivity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion\ndate. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on\nreconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and\nunique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each\nobserved space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability\nand interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed\nfor anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing\nthe input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not\nonly statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also\ndetails anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort\ncan be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing\npriorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization\nacross the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access\nResource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization\nframework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population\ncoverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific\nproportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)\na learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any\nsingle-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with\nstrong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian\nPublic Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical\nefficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5d0\ud2f0\uc624\ud53c\uc544\uc758 \ubcf4\uac74\ubd80\uac00 \ubcf4\uac74\uc18c\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud544\uc218 \uc758\ub8cc \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub300\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ub178\ub825\uc758 \uc77c\ud658\uc73c\ub85c, \uc608\uc0b0\uacfc \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704 \uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 HARP\ub77c\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uc0b0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uad6c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4 \ube44\ub840 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\ud2f0\uc624\ud53c\uc544\uc758 \ubcf4\uac74 \uc99d\uc9c4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "HARP \ub3c4\uad6c \uac1c\ubc1c, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "\uc138 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \ud6a8\ub2a5 \ud655\uc778.", "conclusion": "HARP\ub294 \uc608\uc0b0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc5ed \ubcf4\uac74 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc720\uc5d4\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac1c\ubc1c \ubaa9\ud45c 3\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc804\uad6d\uc801\uc778 \ub178\ub825\uc758 \uc77c\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\ud2f0\uc624\ud53c\uc544 \ubcf4\uac74\ubd80\ub294 \ud544\uc218 \uc758\ub8cc \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub300\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf4\uac74\uc18c\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc81c\ud55c\uacfc \uae30\ud0c0 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc774 \ubcf4\uac74 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac15\ud654 \ub178\ub825\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80\ub9cc\uc774 \ub9e4\ub144 \uc2dc\ud589\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \uc5d0\ud2f0\uc624\ud53c\uc544 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uac04 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud560 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc608\uc0b0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uad6c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub9e4 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4 \ube44\ub840 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uc124 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc778 Health Access Resource Planner (HARP)\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ud6c4, (i) \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uad8c\uc7a5 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc99d\uac15 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc (ii) \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud0d0\uc695 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub450 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ubaa8\ub450 \uac15\ud55c \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\ud2f0\uc624\ud53c\uc544 \uacf5\uacf5 \ubcf4\uac74 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c \ubc0f \ubcf4\uac74\ubd80\uc640\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

However, when we\nenjoy these speech applications, our speech may be collected by attackers for\nspeech synthesis. For example, an attacker generates some inappropriate\npolitical opinions with the characteristic of the victim's voice by obtaining a\npiece of the victim's speech, which will greatly influence the victim's\nreputation. Specifically, with the appearance of some zero-shot voice\nconversion methods, the cost of speech synthesis attacks has been further\nreduced, which also brings greater challenges to user voice security and\nprivacy. Some researchers have proposed the corresponding privacy-preserving\nmethods. However, the existing approaches have some non-negligible drawbacks:\nlow transferability and robustness, high computational overhead. These\ndeficiencies seriously limit the existing method deployed in practical\nscenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a lightweight, robust,\nplug-and-play privacy preservation method against speech synthesis attacks in a\nblack-box setting. Our method generates and adds a frequency-domain\nperturbation to the original speech to achieve privacy protection and high\nspeech quality. Then, we present a data augmentation strategy and noise\nsmoothing mechanism to improve the robustness of the proposed method. Besides,\nto reduce the user's defense overhead, we also propose a novel identity-wise\nprotection mechanism. It can generate a universal perturbation for one speaker\nand support privacy preservation for speech of any length. Finally, we conduct\nextensive experiments on 5 speech synthesis models, 5 speech verification\nmodels, 1 speech recognition model, and 2 datasets.

However, severe class imbalance, where\nnormal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable\nchallenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,\npost-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a\ndirect comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class\nimbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an\nexperimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing\nmethods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score\nimprovement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest\ninference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most\nsubstantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows\nlimited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and\nlatency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most\neffective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.\nIn low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest\nperformance with minimal inference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc7a5\uc560 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc120\ucc98\ub9ac, \uc911\ucc98\ub9ac, \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad11 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc7a5\uc560 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc815\uc0c1 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uac00 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc0ac\ub840\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \uc644\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc120\ucc98\ub9ac, \uc911\ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc7a5\uc560 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 F1 \uc810\uc218 \ud5a5\uc0c1(\ucd5c\ub300 15.3%)\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, Random Under-Sampling\uc740 \uac00\uc7a5 \ube60\ub978 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc7a5\uc560 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 GenAI \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc624\uba70(\ucd5c\ub300 24.2%), \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uacb9\uce68\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 SMOTE\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uacfc\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad11 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc7a5\uc560 \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144\uac04 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc815\uc0c1 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uac00 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc0ac\ub840\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc911\uac04 \ucc98\ub9ac \uae30\ubc95\uc774 \ub110\ub9ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud06c\uac8c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud328 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \uc644\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac, \uc911\uac04 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud328 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 F1 \uc810\uc218 \ud5a5\uc0c1(\ucd5c\ub300 15.3%)\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, Random Under-Sampling\uc740 \uac00\uc7a5 \ube60\ub978 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud328 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 GenAI \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1(\ucd5c\ub300 24.2%)\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uacb9\uce68\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc640 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 SMOTE\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uacfc\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc88b\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub0ae\uc740 \uacb9\uce68 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Rule\nbased heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by\noverlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle\nconfiguration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge\n(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nreliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates\ntargeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via\nfocused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated\nreasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency.

In this\nwork, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal\nrepresentation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the\nwidely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single\nscale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce\nthe Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching\nmultiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling\ndirect supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training\nstrategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a\nspecific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling.

However, its\ndistributed nature forces the central server to blindly trust the local\ntraining process and aggregate uncertain model updates, making it susceptible\nto Byzantine attacks from malicious participants, especially in\nmission-critical scenarios. Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the\ndiverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem\nfrom benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior.\nExisting data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from\nnatural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering\nperformance.\n  To address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation\n(RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and\nmitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system\nemploys code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical\nvariables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted\ntraining recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an\nattestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted\nto the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client\ntraining processes remain free from program behavior violation or data\nmanipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the\nglobal model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel\nensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime\nand memory overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

This study presents a framework that detects anomalies\nand provides high-quality explanations through visual tools BERTViz and Captum,\ncombined with natural language reports based on attention outputs.

We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables\nfully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently\noptimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that\nthe challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled\ncontrol plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning (\"what to\noptimize\") from the system's role of execution (\"how to observe and act\").\nImplemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable\ninterface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving\nScheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all\nAI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic\nanalysis.\n  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent\nsystem that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling\npolicies, and deploys them via the sched\\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation\nshows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x\ncost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high\nsuccess rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level\nsystem optimization and represents a step towards creating truly\nself-optimizing, application-aware operating systems.

Unlike software flaws, which are\noften patchable post-deployment, hardware weaknesses remain embedded across\nproduct lifecycles, posing persistent risks to processors, embedded devices,\nand IoT platforms. Existing efforts such as the MITRE CWE Hardware List (2021)\nrelied on expert-driven Delphi surveys, which lack statistical rigor and\nintroduce subjective bias, while large-scale data-driven foundations for\nhardware weaknesses have been largely absent. In this work, we propose\nLLM-HyPZ, an LLM-assisted hybrid framework for zero-shot knowledge extraction\nand refinement from vulnerability corpora. Our approach integrates zero-shot\nLLM classification, contextualized embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and\nprompt-driven summarization to mine hardware-related CVEs at scale. Applying\nLLM-HyPZ to the 2021-2024 CVE corpus (114,836 entries), we identified 1,742\nhardware-related vulnerabilities. We distilled them into five recurring themes,\nincluding privilege escalation via firmware and BIOS, memory corruption in\nmobile and IoT systems, and physical access exploits. Benchmarking across seven\nLLMs shows that LLaMA 3.3 70B achieves near-perfect classification accuracy\n(99.5%) on a curated validation set. Beyond methodological contributions, our\nframework directly supported the MITRE CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses\n(MIHW) 2025 update by narrowing the candidate search space. Specifically, our\npipeline surfaced 411 of the 1,026 CVEs used for downstream MIHW analysis,\nthereby reducing expert workload and accelerating evidence gathering. These\nresults establish LLM-HyPZ as the first data-driven, scalable approach for\nsystematically discovering hardware vulnerabilities, thereby bridging the gap\nbetween expert knowledge and real-world vulnerability evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc758 \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ub450\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM-HyPZ\ub77c\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad00\ub828 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc870\uc0ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc5c4\uaca9\uc131\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "LLM-HyPZ\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 LLM \ubd84\ub958, \uc815\uc0c1\ud654\ub41c \uc784\ubca0\ub529, \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc694\uc57d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad00\ub828 CVE\ub97c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "2021-2024 CVE \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c 1,742\uac1c\uc758 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad00\ub828 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc81c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM-HyPZ\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uc99d\uac70 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc758 \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uae34\uae09\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ub450\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacb0\ud568\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \uc57d\uc810\uc740 \uc81c\ud488 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uace0\ucc29\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c, \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc \uc7a5\uce58 \ubc0f IoT \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work,\nwe make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with\nvalid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates\nsynthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a\ncustomized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic\nGraph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI\ncommunity. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit\nconstraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte\nCarlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the\ngenerated graph.

RAG raises latency and\nengineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is\nbrittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks\ncatastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):\ncurated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters\nupdated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection\nEngine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and\nfailures, and proposes typed deltas $\\Delta K=(\\Delta S,\\Delta U,\\Delta T)$\nover instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,\nevaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first\nfailure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a\nthreshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills\nmatured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space\nimprovements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the\nlow-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves\ngovernance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased\nthroughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen\nbaseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept \"L0 Support\", it achieved\n4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous\ninstruction updates and optional tool synthesis.

Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals\nby constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses\ncaused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on\npredefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited\ninformation, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of\nmeasuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of\ngenerating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,\nwe propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates\nthree Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize\nexperimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high\nquality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social\nenvironment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social\ncollaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role\nrelationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with\nthe PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states\nof each agent and these generating scenarios.

VR\ndevices such as Meta Quest 3 utilize numerous sensors to collect users' data to\nprovide an immersive experience. Due to the extensive data collection and the\nimmersive nature, the security of VR devices is paramount. Leading VR devices\noften adopt and customize Android systems, which makes them susceptible to both\nAndroid-based vulnerabilities and new issues introduced by VR-specific\ncustomizations (e.g., system services to support continuous head and hand\ntracking). While prior work has extensively examined the security properties of\nthe Android software stack, how these security properties hold for VR systems\nremains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security\nanalysis of VR firmware. We collect over 300 versions of VR firmware from two\nmajor vendors, Quest and Pico, and perform a longitudinal analysis across the\nkernel layer, the system binary and library layer, and the application layer.\nWe have identified several security issues in these VR firmware, including\nmissing kernel-level security features, insufficient binary hardening,\ninconsistent permission enforcement, and inadequate SELinux policy enforcement.\nBased on our findings, we synthesize recommendations for VR vendors to improve\nsecurity and trust for VR devices.

Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from\na lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks\nrequiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the\ntraining data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best\npractices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained\npopularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this\npaper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM\nperformance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best\npractices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution\nprocesses using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over\ntheir behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based\napproaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety\nof tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question\nanswering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving\nthe performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the\naforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares\ndifferent state machine configurations against baseline approaches without\nstate machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines\nsignificantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly\nbeneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but\nlacking data used for training LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c SHERPA\ub77c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654\uc758 \ubaa8\ubc94 \uc0ac\ub840\uac00 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654\uc758 \ubaa8\ubc94 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 SHERPA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud568.", "result": "SHERPA\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131, \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc774\ub984 \uc0dd\uc131, \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "SHERPA\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\uc885 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ubc94 \uc0ac\ub840\uac00 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ubaa8\ubc94 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubc29\ubc95(\uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc0ac\uc2ac \ubc0f \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ub4f1)\uc774 \uc778\uae30\ub97c \uc5bb\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc LLM \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654\uc758 \ubaa8\ubc94 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uacc4\uce35 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\uacc4\uc5d0 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c SHERPA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\uacc4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uc2e4\ud589 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 SHERPA\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd, \ud2b9\ud788 LLM\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uaddc\uce59\uc774\ub098 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general\nframework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight\nagent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent\nconfigurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in\na distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by\nreusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These\ngradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR\nproblems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that\nbecomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by\ntruncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for\nrapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors.

Leveraging Purdue\nUniversitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a\nrepresentative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections\nand denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor\nconditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and\nover 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data\npoints. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between\nnormal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging\nconditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and\ninformation technology data improved classification accuracy but posed\nchallenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber\nevents. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear\ncybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in\nhandling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI/ML\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc6d0\uc790\ub825 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc791\ub3d9 \uc911\uc778 \uc6d0\uc790\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Purdue \ub300\ud559\uad50\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc6d0\uc790\ub85c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub2e4\uce35 AI/ML \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc815\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6d0\uc790\ub825 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \ubc0f \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(ML)\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud61c\ud0dd\uc744 \uae30\ub300\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601 \uae30\uc220 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uce35 AI/ML \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uace0 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Such multimodal data can be used\nto identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,\nsuch as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural\ndisasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and\ndifficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for\nidentifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an\nincident, as well as understanding the different components which define an\nincident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the\ncauses of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and\nintensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create\nSIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal\nUrban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary\nworld knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in\nurban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize\nevidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and\nhuman-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents.

This study systematically investigates the\nstructural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human\ntutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an\nInitiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis\n(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to\ntheir AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and\ngeneral feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a\nfundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more\ncognitively guided and diverse, centered around a \"question-factual\nresponse-feedback\" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and\nstudent-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of\nstructural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an\n\"explanation-simplistic response\" loop that is essentially a simple information\ntransfer between the teacher and student.

Existing decision-support systems often fall\nshort in accounting for multi-agent, multi-path attacks and trade-offs between\nsafety and operational continuity. To address this, our framework integrates\nhierarchical system modelling with Bayesian probabilistic reasoning,\nconstructing Bayesian Network Graphs from system architecture and vulnerability\ndata. Models are encoded using a Domain Specific Language to enhance\ncomputational efficiency and support dynamic updates. In our approach, we use a\nhybrid exposure probability estimation framework, which combines Exploit\nPrediction Scoring System and Common Vulnerability Scoring System scores via\nBayesian confidence calibration to handle epistemic uncertainty caused by\nincomplete or heterogeneous vulnerability metadata. Mitigation recommendations\nare generated as countermeasure portfolios, refined using multi-objective\noptimisation to identify Pareto-optimal strategies balancing attack likelihood,\nimpact severity, and system availability. To accommodate time- and\nresource-constrained incident response, frequency-based heuristics are applied\nto prioritise countermeasures across the optimised portfolios. The framework\nwas evaluated through three representative cyber-physical attack scenarios,\ndemonstrating its versatility in handling complex adversarial behaviours under\nreal-time response constraints. The results affirm its utility in operational\ncontexts and highlight the robustness of our proposed approach across diverse\nthreat environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a\ndata-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score\n(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),\nthen partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and\nup-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical\ninfluence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting\nhigh-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via\nuniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary\nextraction success by over 40\\% at just 10\\% data pruning, while increasing\nvalidation perplexity by less than 0.5\\%.

We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires\niterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal\nraw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a\nbenchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw\ncontents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news\narticle by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction\nand firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are\ntasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,\nretrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical\nsummarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available\nand must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in\nreal-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived\nfrom real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model\ncompatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used\nagentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of\nretrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative\nintegration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating\nand evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation\nto real-world productivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc6f9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc744 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc800\ub110\ub9ac\uc998 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ub274\uc2a4 \uae30\uc0ac\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, NEWSAGENT\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc800\ub110\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc6d0\uc2dc \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub274\uc2a4\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "NEWSAGENT\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub274\uc2a4 \ucd08\uc548\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc791\ubb38 \uc9c0\uce68\uacfc \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc57c\uae30 \uad00\uc810 \uc2dd\ubcc4, \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c8\uc758 \uc81c\uacf5, \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ubc30\uacbd \uac80\uc0c9, \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uae30\uc0ac \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc624\ud508 \ubc0f \ud074\ub85c\uc988\ub4dc \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uad00\ub828 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc774\uc57c\uae30 \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "NEWSAGENT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc6f9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc870\uc791\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc790\uc728 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc6f9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc744 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d, \ud574\uc11d \ubc0f \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ucd94\ub9ac\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc800\ub110\ub9ac\uc998 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \ub274\uc2a4 \uae30\uc0ac\ub97c \uc791\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uac80\uc0c9, \uc815\ubcf4 \uc120\ud0dd, \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 NEWSAGENT\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc791\ubb38 \uc9c0\uce68\uacfc \uc800\ub110\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \ub274\uc2a4 \ucd08\uc548\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\uc57c\uae30 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c8\uc758\ub97c \ud558\uace0, \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ubc30\uacbd\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0, \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uae30\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc57d \ub610\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac \ud544\uc218 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc740 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub274\uc2a4 \uc791\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4.

While recent work\nhas explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches\nsuffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance\nfidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur\nexcessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over\nthe tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address\nthese gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous\nonline reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration\nwith substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment\npreparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end\nlatency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single\nparameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or\nany point along this continuum.

Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority\nvoting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate\nresponses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates\nare incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also\nincurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative\nSelf-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a\nunified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then\nperforms self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a\nprompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle\nto perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design\na hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary\nobjectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this\nlearned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across\ndifferent model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.", "AI":

Bruckstein"], "title": "VariAntNet: Learning Decentralized Control of Multi-Agent Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response\napplications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in\ncomplex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent\ncommunication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known\nas Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing\ncapabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate\nexplicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in\nmaintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.\nRecent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the\nclassical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep\nlearning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent\nswarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric\nfeatures extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It\nincorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,\ndifferentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that\npromotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph\nLaplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent\ngathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must\ngather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing\nanalytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while\nmaintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes.

We introduce\nNADGO (Noise-Adaptive Dummy-Gate Obfuscation), a scheduling and obfuscation\nstack that enforces operational privacy for gate-model workloads by applying\nper-interval limits on observable information leakage. To support\nconfidentiality and fair multi-tenancy, operators require a method to audit\ncompliance at acceptable overheads. NADGO combines: (i) hardware-aware t-design\npadding for structured cover traffic, (ii) particle-filter timing randomization\nto mask queue patterns, (iii) CASQUE subcircuit routing across heterogeneous\nbackends, and (iv) a per-interval leakage estimator with locked calibration\nartifacts and a dual-threshold kill-switch. We prototype the approach on a\n4-qubit superconducting tile with cryo-CMOS control and evaluate both\ndepth-varied local-random circuits and small QAOA instances. Monitoring runs at\na 6.3 microsecond control interval, and per-interval decisions are recorded in\nan append-only, hash-chained audit log. Across Monte Carlo (Tier 1) and\ncloud-hardware emulation (Tier 2) evaluations, NADGO maintains leakage within\nbudget in nominal operation (interval-abort rate below 1 percent) and under\nattack yields high separation with concentrated aborts.

However, the practical use of these\ntechniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's\nGeneral Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of\nsensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving\ncomputational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx\nalgorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian\nBasic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was\ntrained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its\nperformance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two\nmillion student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an\naccuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of\n61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust\nprivacy guarantee. The results indicate that Federated Learning is a viable and\neffective solution for building collaborative predictive models in the\nBrazilian educational context, in alignment with the requirements

With the commonly added stabilizer to improve\ntexture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report\nexplores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and\ncarrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective\nwas to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify\na more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each\nadditive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled\nconditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the\nprogression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and\nanalysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure\neven after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of\na stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen\nand subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating\nimproved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the\ndifferent stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some\noffering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.\nOverall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly\nused food additives in ice cream formulation.

However,\neven with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or\nlong-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches\nto prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found\nin the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right\nweight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this\npaper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either\nsmooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs\nand states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous\ninputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As\nanalogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to\nbold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to\npeculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past.

With the\nrise of large language models (LLMs), leveraging their ability to understand\ncode semantics has emerged as a promising direction for achieving more accurate\nand efficient vulnerability detection. However, current LLM-based approaches\nface significant challenges: instability in model outputs, limitations in\ncontext length, and hallucination. As a result, many existing solutions either\nuse LLMs merely to enrich predefined rule sets, thereby keeping the detection\nprocess fundamentally rule-based, or over-rely on them, leading to poor\nrobustness. To address these challenges, we propose a constraint-solving\napproach powered by LLMs named VULSOLVER.

However,\ncurrent EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the\ncooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the\nprocess of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities\nbetween sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting\ngreater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a\nnovel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to\nhighlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be\nspecific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models\nwill receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other\nsub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign\nweights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance\nregularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our\nproposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT\nmethods.

The proposed system interprets textual\ninput to automatically generate layout options including walls, doors, windows,\nand furniture arrangements. It combines prompt engineering, a furniture\nplacement refinement algorithm, and Python scripting to produce spatially\ncoherent draft plans compatible with design tools such as Autodesk Revit.

Moreover, high precision, recall, and F1-scores were attained\nacross all classifiers while substantially reducing training and testing times,\nmaking the framework highly suitable for real-time applications. To ensure fair\ndetection across diverse attack types, dataset balancing via downsampling was\napplied to address class imbalance challenges.

While detection methods have been extensively developed for\nimages and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been\nlargely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially\nchallenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.\nWe address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the\nwild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas.

In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and\nreason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help\nAI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a\nPOMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,\nsuch as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be\nautomatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show\nS3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social\nreasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning\nwith OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then\ninduce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating\ntheir ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent\ndecision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social\ninteraction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a\npowerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the\ndevelopment of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social\ninteractions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc0ac\ud68c \uc138\uacc4 \ud45c\ud604 \ud615\uc2dd\uc778 S3AP\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This study proposes a hybrid\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced\nwith Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic\noptimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL\nagent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,\nGeneral and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to\nhistorical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic\ndeviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate\nshifting financial contexts.

Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research\nhas increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing\ntextual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast\ndiscrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal\narchitectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,\nresulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address\nthis modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment\nfor LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting\nframework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw\ntime series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive\nstatistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,\nproducing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context\nalignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling\nstrategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual\nembeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the\naligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together\nintegrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show\nthat, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability\nto harness complementary information from text and time series.

Accepted for publication in the proceedings of 7th IEEE\n  International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Intelligent\n  Systems, and Applications (IEEE TPS 2025)", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical\nsystems, facilitating tasks such as satellite operations, command-and-control,\nmilitary decision support, and cyber defense. Many of these systems are\naccessed through application programming interfaces (APIs). When such APIs lack\nrobust access controls, they can expose full or top-k logits, creating a\nsignificant and often overlooked attack surface. Prior art has mainly focused\non reconstructing the output projection layer or distilling surface-level\nbehaviors. However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query\nconstraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a\nconstrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a\nfunctional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i)\nreconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under\n10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits,\nthen (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with\nvarying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer\nstudent recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry,\nwith only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood\n(NLL). A 4-layer variant achieves 17.1% faster inference and 18.1% parameter\nreduction with comparable performance. The entire attack completes in under 24\ngraphics processing unit (GPU) hours and avoids triggering API rate-limit\ndefenses. These results demonstrate how quickly a cost-limited adversary can\nclone an LLM, underscoring the urgent need for hardened inference APIs and\nsecure on-premise defense deployments.", "AI": {"tldr":

This discovery\nraises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these\ncritical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that\nnaively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently\nremoves crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite\nits reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose\nTruthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater\nemphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative\nfeatures simultaneously.

Developing\ngeneralizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network\nenvironments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web\napplications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are\ndiverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.\nNetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as\nnatural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract\nspecifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which\na state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This\ndesign enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state\ncaching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,\nNetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,\nlive video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,\nproducing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability.

In this work, we present a unified framework\nfor designing an adaptive WF defense that combines the effectiveness of\nregularization with the provable security of supersequence-style grouping.

Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)\nmethods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the\nnon-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their\nderivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks\ndiscretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead\nto accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this\npaper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple\nyet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any\nforward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE\nprogressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their\nquantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven\nmixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a\nco-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for\nprediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified\nand generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet\nacross various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE\nconsistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables\nlow-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their\nfull-precision counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uce35 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc778\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\ubcc4 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucd94\uc815(PEGE)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uce35 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc218 \uae30\uc220\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 Straight-Through Estimator (STE)\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CIFAR-10\uacfc ImageNet\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, PEGE\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5ed\uc804\ud30c \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc800\uc815\ubc00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uace0\uc815\ubc00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub9de\ucd94\uac70\ub098 \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PEGE\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc190\uc2e4\uacfc \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c QAT\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub294 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc640 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc758 \ube44\ud2b8 \ub108\ube44\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uce35 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc778\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828(QAT) \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ube44\ubbf8\ubd84\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Straight-Through Estimator (STE)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\ubd84\uc744 \ud56d\ub4f1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, STE\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uac12\uacfc \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub41c \uac12 \uac04\uc758 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc800\ud558\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 STE\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that\ndecomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application\nstages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and\nformalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.\nThe second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:\nanalyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing\nsymbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating\nfinal answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the\nontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with\nsymbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,\nsignificantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.\nEvaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial\nimprovements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\\% accuracy compared to\n18.8\\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between\nreasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular\narchitectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated\nlegal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while\nenhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a\nfoundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and\neffective AI systems for legal domain.",

To enable secure\nevaluation of practical functions, it is essential to computing\n$\\mathsf{Real}(x)$ from shared inputs, as protocols take shares as input. At\nUSENIX'25, Guo et al. proposed an efficient method for computing signed integer\nvalues $\\mathsf{int}(x)$ from shares, which can be extended to compute\n$\\mathsf{Real}(x)$. However, their approach imposes a restrictive input\nconstraint $|x| < \\frac{L}{3}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_L$, limiting its\napplicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we significantly relax\nthis constraint to $|x| < B$ for any $B \\leq \\frac{L}{2}$, where $B =\n\\frac{L}{2}$ corresponding to the natural representable range in $x \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}_L$. This relaxes the restrictions and enables the computation of\n$\\mathsf{Real}(x)$ with loose or no input constraints. Building upon this\nfoundation, we present a generalized framework for designing secure protocols\nfor a broad class of functions, including integer division ($\\lfloor\n\\frac{x}{d} \\rfloor$), trigonometric ($\\sin(x)$) and exponential ($e^{-x}$)\nfunctions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocols\nachieve both high efficiency and high accuracy. Notably, our protocol for\nevaluating $e^{-x}$ reduces communication costs to approximately 31% of those\nin SirNN (S&P 21) and Bolt (S&P 24), with runtime speedups of up to $5.53\n\\times$ and $3.09 \\times$, respectively.

To\naddress these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,\nthat automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system\nleverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically\ngenerating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware\nlimitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition\nmethod. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial\ncomplex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly\nstructured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated\nQUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical\nsolvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the\nframework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a\nsynergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,\naddressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.\nThis

However, hallucination\nissues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text\nmodality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues\nwhile neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal\nscenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or\nauditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the\nintrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This\noversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden\naudio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose\nOmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations\nin OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing\ntext-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of\naudio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample\npairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.\nBy tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding\nand reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that\nOmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also\nsignificantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.\nAll code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniDPO\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc774\ud574\uc640 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Omni-modal \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "OmniDPO\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc120\ud638 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc30d\uacfc \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec-\uc120\ud638 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc30d\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec audio-video \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac01 \ubc0f \uccad\uac01 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "OmniDPO\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uadf8\ub77c\uc6b4\ub529\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ud658\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc OmniDPO\ub294 \ud658\uac01\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc \uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 Omni-modal \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(OLLM)\uc774 \uc624\ub514\uc624-\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud658\uacbd \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubb3c\uacb0\uc744 \uc77c\uc73c\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \uc6b0\uc120\uad8c\uc774 \ucee4\uc11c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub2e8\uc11c\uc5d0 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uace0, \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \ubc0f \uc624\ub514\uc624 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \ub610\ub294 \uccad\uac01 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ub514\uc624\uc640 \ud574\ub2f9 \uc624\ub514\uc624 \uac04\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac04\uacfc\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ub2e8\uc11c\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ud658\uac01\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud658\uac01\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc120\ud638 \uc815\ub82c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 OmniDPO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c OmniDPO\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc624\ub514\uc624-\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc120\ud638 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc30d\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0;

An important question arises: Does the\nfinal layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \\emph{de facto}\nrepresentational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?\nAlthough our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this\nquestion is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the\nrepresentation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we\nintroduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers\nAggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise\nrepresentations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.\nWe first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision\nTransformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of\nrelying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to\nselectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,\nthereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the\ndownstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the\npretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise\naveraging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 ECG\ub97c \uc704\ud55c Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uce35 \uac04 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc885 \uce35\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uce35\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers Aggregation (PMA) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 ECG \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "PMA \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uce35\ubcc4 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uace0, \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uce35\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uac8c\uc774\ud305 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc735\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud558\uc704 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub514\ucf54\ub354 \uae30\ubc18 Transformer\uc5d0 \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c\ub3c4 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Transformer \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4(ECG) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \ub9ce\uc740 \ud558\uc704 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac01 \uce35\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd5c\uc885 \uce35\uc740 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560\uae4c\uc694? \uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub2f5\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubc0f \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uce35 \uac04 \ud45c\ud604 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Transformer \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uce35 \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uce35\ubcc4 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers Aggregation (PMA)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 ECG \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 1\ucc28\uc6d0 \ube44\uc804 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(ViT)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Masked Modeling\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc704 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd5c\uc885 \uce35\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac8c\uc774\ud305 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uce35\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc735\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud558\uc704 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \ub514\ucf54\ub354 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 Transformer\uc5d0 \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Fully\nhomomorphic encryption (FHE) enables inference directly on encrypted inputs,\nbut its practicality is hindered by expensive bootstrapping and inefficient\napproximations of non-linear activations. We introduce Safhire, a hybrid\ninference framework that executes linear layers under encryption on the server\nwhile offloading non-linearities to the client in plaintext. This design\neliminates bootstrapping, supports exact activations, and significantly reduces\ncomputation. To safeguard model confidentiality despite client access to\nintermediate outputs, Safhire applies randomized shuffling, which obfuscates\nintermediate values and makes it practically impossible to reconstruct the\nmodel. To further reduce latency, Safhire incorporates advanced optimizations\nsuch as fast ciphertext packing and partial extraction. Evaluations on multiple\nstandard models and datasets show that Safhire achieves 1.5X - 10.5X lower\ninference latency than Orion, a state-of-the-art baseline, with manageable\ncommunication overhead and comparable accuracy, thereby establishing the\npracticality of hybrid FHE inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Safhire\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc131\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0\uc11c \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc120\ud615 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub798\ud551\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\uba70 \ubcf4\uc548\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubbfc\uac10 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \uc11c\ubc84 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\ubc00\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Safhire\ub294 \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uc790\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc120\ud615 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc744 \ud3c9\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Safhire\ub294 Orion\ubcf4\ub2e4 1.5X - 10.5X \ub0ae\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uace0, \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc644\uc804 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638(FHE) \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uace0 \uc11c\ubc84 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc644\uc804 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638(FHE)\ub294 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace0\ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub798\ud551\uacfc \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc800\ud574\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0\uc11c \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc120\ud615 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc624\ud504\ub85c\ub4dc\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Safhire\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub798\ud551\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uac04 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Safhire\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \uac12\uc744 \ubaa8\ud638\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uac70\uc758 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uc154\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Safhire\ub294 \ube60\ub978 \uc554\ud638\ubb38 \ud328\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ubd80\ubd84 \ucd94\ucd9c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uae09 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud45c\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, Safhire\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc778 Orion\ubcf4\ub2e4 1.5\ubc30\uc5d0\uc11c 10.5\ubc30 \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc FHE \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Here we demonstrate that pre-trained\nknowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.\nUsing six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684\nexperiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian\noptimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or\nexceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages\ngrowing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become\nscarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective\ntrade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a\ntopology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity\nthroughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain\nsystematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while\nachieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in\nsolution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails\n- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective\nnavigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured\nexploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community\nvalidation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a\nno-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM\noptimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories.

This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains\ncoherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We\nevaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple\nchoice legal questions in 2025.

Reconstructing complete attack chains from massive, heterogeneous\nlogs is essential for effective attack investigation, yet existing methods\nsuffer from poor platform generality, limited generalization to evolving\ntactics, and an inability to produce analyst-ready reports. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) offer strong semantic understanding and summarization\ncapabilities, but in this domain they struggle to capture the long-range,\ncross-log dependencies critical for accurate reconstruction.\n  To solve these problems, we present an LLM-empowered attack investigation\nframework augmented with a dynamically adaptable Kill-Chain-aligned threat\nknowledge base.

However, their computational and energy demands have grown\nproportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a\nwider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates\nprincipled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning\nsystems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints\nand non-differentiability.\n  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture\ndesign, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose\nnovel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying\ndiscrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based\ntraining of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These\napproximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,\nleading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the\ncontext of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture\nsearch that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore\nimplicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,\nrevisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an\nadaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.\n  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via\nscalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image\nclassification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the\nproposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and\ninference

We\napproach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To\ninstill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces\nfrom a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines\nselect reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals\nthat poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware\nRejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors\ntraces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,\nwith lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with\na large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher\nmodel, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection\nsampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces\nphysics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines.

This scenario highlights the need for\nsolutions capable of continuously adapting, since network behavior is dynamic\nand changes over time. This work presents an anomaly detection model for\nnetwork flows using unsupervised machine learning with online learning\ncapabilities. This approach allows the system to dynamically learn the normal\nbehavior of the network and detect deviations without requiring labeled data,\nwhich is particularly useful in real-world environments where traffic is\nconstantly changing and labeled data is scarce.

However, the optimization of\nSharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there\nexist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is\nthat dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other\nis that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we\nstudy the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both\nthe long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge\nwith the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a\nmean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization\nand the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when\nthe risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the\nsecond challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V\noptimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We\niteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that\nis used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V\nproblems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is\nmonotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both\naverage and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure\nand prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted\nfor validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that\nsolves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type\nalgorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving\nMDPs with other fractional objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815

Federated Lifelong Learning (FLL) provides an ideal solution by\nincorporating federated and lifelong learning to overcome catastrophic\nforgetting. The extended lifecycle of FLL in IoT systems increases their\nvulnerability to persistent attacks, and these risks may be obscured by\nperformance degradation caused by spatial-temporal data heterogeneity.\nMoreover, this problem is exacerbated by the standard single-server\narchitecture, as its single point of failure makes it difficult to maintain a\nreliable audit trail for long-term threats. Blockchain provides a tamper-proof\nfoundation for trustworthy FLL systems. Nevertheless, directly applying\nblockchain to FLL significantly increases computational and retrieval costs\nwith the expansion of the knowledge base, slowing down the training on IoT\ndevices. To address these challenges, we propose LiFeChain, a lightweight\nblockchain for secure and efficient federated lifelong learning by providing a\ntamper-resistant ledger with minimal on-chain disclosure and bidirectional\nverification. To the best of our knowledge, LiFeChain is the first blockchain\ntailored for FLL. LiFeChain incorporates two complementary mechanisms: the\nproof-of-model-correlation (PoMC) consensus on the server, which couples\nlearning and unlearning mechanisms to mitigate negative transfer, and segmented\nzero-knowledge arbitration (Seg-ZA) on the client, which detects and arbitrates\nabnormal committee behavior without compromising privacy. LiFeChain is designed\nas a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing\nFLL algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that LiFeChain not only\nenhances model performance against two long-term attacks but also sustains high\nefficiency and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "LiFeChain\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc73c\ub85c, \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \uacf5\uac1c \ubc0f \uc30d\ubc29\ud5a5 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc6d0\uc7a5 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "IoT \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\ud569\uacfc \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 FLL\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "LiFeChain\uc740 \uc624\ub958 \uc804\uc774 \uc644\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc11c\ubc84\uc758 PoMC \ud569\uc758 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ud6fc\uc190\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc911\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 Seg-ZA\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LiFeChain\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub192\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LiFeChain\uc740 \uae30\uc874 FLL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud558\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ac\ubb3c\uc778\ud130\ub137(IoT) \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\ud569 \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5(FLL)\uc740 \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc778 \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that\nmakes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces\nthree synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate\nsystem stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model\nMemory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and\nverification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache\nreuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on\na single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud\nmodels.

While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for\nsuffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints\ndue to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.\nWe propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite\ntraces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.\nOur approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a\nsoft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be\ncombined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to\ngenerate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent.

This Report presents LLMHoney, an SSH honeypot that leverages\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to generate realistic, dynamic command outputs in\nreal time. LLMHoney integrates a dictionary-based virtual file system to handle\ncommon commands with low latency while using LLMs for novel inputs, achieving a\nbalance between authenticity and performance. We implemented LLMHoney using\nopen-source LLMs and evaluated it on a testbed with 138 representative Linux\ncommands. We report comprehensive metrics including accuracy (exact-match,\nCosine Similarity, Jaro-Winkler Similarity, Levenshtein Similarity and BLEU\nscore), response latency and memory overhead. We evaluate LLMHoney using\nmultiple LLM backends ranging from 0.36B to 3.8B parameters, including both\nopen-source models and a proprietary model(Gemini). Our experiments compare 13\ndifferent LLM variants; results show that Gemini-2.0 and moderately-sized\nmodels Qwen2.5:1.5B and Phi3:3.8B provide the most reliable and accurate\nresponses, with mean latencies around 3 seconds, whereas smaller models often\nproduce incorrect or out-of-character outputs. We also discuss how LLM\nintegration improves honeypot realism and adaptability compared to traditional\nhoneypots, as well as challenges such as occasional hallucinated outputs and\nincreased resource usage. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-driven honeypots\nare a promising approach to enhance attacker engagement and collect richer\nthreat intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMHoney\ub294 \ub300\ud654\ud615 SSH \ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f\uc73c\ub85c, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ucee4\ub9e8\ub4dc \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc27d\uac8c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba85\ub839 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub515\uc154\ub108\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac00\uc0c1 \ud30c\uc77c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\uc9c0\uc5f0\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18 \uba85\ub839\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Gemini-2.0 \ubc0f \uc911\uac04 \ud06c\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378(Qwen2.5:1.5B, Phi3:3.8B)\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \uc57d 3\ucd08\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \ucc38\uc5ec\ub97c \uc99d\uc9c4\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc704\ud611 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub97c \ub04c\uc5b4\ub4e4\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ub9cc \ub3c4\uad6c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc800\uc911\uc774\ub098 \uc911\uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc219\ub828\ub41c \uc801\ub4e4\uc774 \uc27d\uac8c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub294 LLMHoney\ub77c\ub294 SSH \ud5c8\ub2c8\ud31f\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the\nTConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.\nTConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a\ntruly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this\nmechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time\ncomputations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single\nlinear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.\nTheoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer\nexhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,\nmemory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks.

We introduce ChatCLIDS, the\nfirst benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for\nhealth behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated\nvirtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and\nrealistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse\nagents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.\nChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social\ninfluence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our\nfindings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies\nover time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under\nrealistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of\ncurrent LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed\nfor advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uc778\uc290\ub9b0 \uc804\ub2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(CLIDS)\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \ud589\ub3d9\uc801, \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub0ae\uc74c\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uac74\uac15 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc124\ub4dd \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 ChatCLIDS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uc778\uc290\ub9b0 \uc804\ub2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(CLIDS)\uc774 \ub2f9\ub1e8 1\ud615 \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc801, \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc7a5\ubcbd \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "ChatCLIDS\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uac70\uce5c \uac00\uc0c1 \ud658\uc790 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc640 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\ub4dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uac04\ud638\uc0ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub300\ud654 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub354 \ud06c\uace0 \ubc18\uc601\uc801\uc778 LLM\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc555\ubc15 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc800\ud56d\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc7ac LLM\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc640 \uadf8 \uc774\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc124\ub4dd AI\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4, \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "1\ud615 \ub2f9\ub1e8\ubcd1 \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uc778\uc290\ub9b0 \uc804\ub2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(CLIDS)\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc801, \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uae30\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac74\uac15 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\ub4dd \ub300\ud654\ub97c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 ChatCLIDS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud55c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uacfc \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ucc44\ud0dd \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\uc0c1 \ud658\uc790 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub97c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\ub4dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uac04\ud638\uc0ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911\ud68c\uc804 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

(MILCOM), (Los\n  Angeles, CA), Oct. 2025", "summary": "As 5G networks gain traction in defense applications, ensuring the privacy\nand integrity of the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol is\ncritical. While 5G AKA improves upon previous generations by concealing\nsubscriber identities, it remains vulnerable to replay-based synchronization\nand linkability threats under realistic adversary models. This paper provides a\nunified analysis of the standardized 5G AKA flow, identifying several\nvulnerabilities and highlighting how each exploits protocol behavior to\ncompromise user privacy. To address these risks, we present five lightweight\nmitigation strategies. We demonstrate through prototype implementation and\ntesting that these enhancements strengthen resilience against linkability\nattacks with minimal computational and signaling overhead. Among the solutions\nstudied, those introducing a UE-generated nonce emerge as the most promising,\neffectively neutralizing the identified tracking and correlation attacks with\nnegligible additional overhead. Integrating this extension as an optional\nfeature to the standard 5G AKA protocol offers a backward-compatible,\nlow-overhead path toward a more privacy-preserving authentication framework for\nboth commercial and military 5G deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "5G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc778\uc99d \ubc0f \ud0a4 \ud569\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4

A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world\napplications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the\nparameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter\nestimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,\nmultiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method\ncapable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system\nresponses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to\ncontinuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state\nvariables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct\nparameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter\nestimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors\nby two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor\nof ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation\ncapabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data\nwhere PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter\ninference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,\nhealthcare, and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "Neptune\uc740 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uce21\uc815\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c PDE\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Neptune\uc740 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc88c\ud45c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uacf5\uac04\uc774\ub098 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Neptune\uc740 50\uac1c\uc758 \uad00\uce21\uce58\ub85c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub450 \ubc30 \uc791\uc740 \ucd94\uc815 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Neptune\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1, \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4 \ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ud654\ub41c \ud3b8\ubbf8\ubd84\ubc29\uc815\uc2dd(PDE)\uc740 \uacf5\ud559, \uc758\ub8cc \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ud654\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper presents a comprehensive\nanalysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and\nproposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify\nthat theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action\nsupport collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have\nscale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation\nstrategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR\nframework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform\nexploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive\ndiagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc\nPoker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify\ncritical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final\nexploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the\nclassical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective\ncomponent usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the\nclassical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful\ncomponent selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:\n(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled\nmitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale\nexperimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and\n(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR)\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \uac8c\uc784 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\ud638 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MCCFR\uc740 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uacfc\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uc758\uc874\uc801 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Robust Deep MCCFR \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c, \uade0\uc77c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud63c\ud569, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc778\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c, \uc885\ud569\uc801 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Kuhn \ubc0f Leduc Poker\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uac70 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 Leduc Poker\uc5d0\uc11c 23.5% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR)\uc740 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc73c\ub098, \uae4a\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uacfc\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd MCCFR \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uac8c\uc784 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9, \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ubd95\uad34, \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud3ed\ubc1c, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc6dc \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc54c\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc791\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \ud070 \uac8c\uc784 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc644\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c Robust Deep MCCFR \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c, \uade0\uc77c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud63c\ud569, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc778\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubc0f \uc885\ud569\uc801 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.

Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using\nSATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,\nparticularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats.

Accepted and Presented at NPIC &\n  HMIT 2025. The official proceedings version is available in the ANS Digital\n  Library", "summary": "Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) play a vital role in ensuring public\nsafety across various settings, from nuclear facilities to medical\nenvironments. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to\ncyber-attacks such as data injection, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, ICMP\nfloods, botnet attacks, privilege escalation, and distributed denial-of-service\n(DDoS) attacks. Such threats could compromise the integrity and reliability of\nradiation measurements, posing significant public health and safety risks. This\npaper presents a new synthetic radiation dataset and an Intrusion Detection\nSystem (IDS) tailored for resource-constrained environments, bringing Machine\nLearning (ML) predictive capabilities closer to the sensing edge layer of\ncritical infrastructure. Leveraging TinyML techniques, the proposed IDS employs\nan optimized XGBoost model enhanced with pruning, quantization, feature\nselection, and sampling. These TinyML techniques significantly reduce the size\nof the model and computational demands, enabling real-time intrusion detection\non low-resource devices while maintaining a reasonable balance between\nefficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc790\uc6d0 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud569\uc131 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \uce21\uc815\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uacf5\uacf5 \ubcf4\uac74\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c IDS\ub294 TinyML \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c XGBoost \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30, \uc591\uc790\ud654, \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uae30\uc220\ub4e4\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(RDSs)\uc740 \ud575 \uc2dc\uc124\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uacf5 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc8fc\uc785, \uc911\uac04\uc790 \uacf5\uaca9(MITM), ICMP \ud50c\ub7ec\ub4dc, \ubd07\ub137 \uacf5\uaca9, \uad8c\ud55c \uc0c1\uc2b9, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uac70\ubd80(DDoS) \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ucde8\uc57d\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc740 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \uce21\uc815\uc758 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud6fc\uc190\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uacf5 \uac74\uac15 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub9de\ucda4\ud654\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud569\uc131 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(IDS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \uc608\uce21 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc758 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub354 \uac00\uae5d\uac8c \ub2e4\uac00\uac00\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.

Transformer-based\narchitectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer\nfrom quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.\nState space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face\nunstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited\nrobustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose\nthe Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid\nquantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a\nvariational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,\nQ-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose\nexpectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating\nmechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term\ndependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We\nempirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,\nand Exchange Rate.

Accepted and Presented at ISOFIC\n  2024. The official proceedings version is available on the conference site", "summary": "Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) are used to measure and detect abnormal\nlevels of radioactive material in the environment. These systems are used in\nmany applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive\nmaterial. However, these systems lack protection against malicious external\nattacks to modify the data. The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems\n(IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical\ninfrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to\nsafeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common\nattack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm\nthe system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient\nMachine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing\non DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a\nsimulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an\nevaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector\nMachine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine\n(LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs.

Prior works rely on\nexpert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor\nshapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the\nreinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel\nlearning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor\nrepresentations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous\nagent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with\nthe TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to\nlearn from both real and imagined actions.

In this work, we present\nLENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic\nmethod that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models\n(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural\nlanguage. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing\nhand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through\nsystematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we\ndemonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM\nprompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach\ntransferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning\nexperiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human\nperformance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may\noverwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.\nOur work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to\nsupport human learning.

AmphiKey offers two\ndistinct operational modes within a single framework: an Authenticated Mode and\na Deniable Mode. The Authenticated Mode employs a blackbox approach, combining\nephemeral ML-KEM-768 and X25519 with long-term Raccoon DSA keys to provide\nforward secrecy and strong, non-repudiable authenticity. This design achieves\n\"OR\" confidentiality, where security holds if either of the KEMs is unbroken,\nand robust \"AND\" authenticity. For the signature operation, it leverages the\n'masking-friendly' Raccoon digital signature (DSA), which is specifically\ndesigned for side-channel attack resistance, though this protection is\nlocalized to the signing key and does not provide deniability. In contrast,\nDeniable Mode provides deniable authentication, preserving privacy. The\nprotocol used ML-KEM-768 (AKEM-1), Ephemeral X25519 (AKEM-2), Raccoon-based DSA\n(Rac) (compared performance to ML-DSA-65), and the Ascon cipher to deliver its\nsecurity guarantees. Key contributions include providing a flexible protocol\nwith enhanced security, optional deniability, and efficiency adapted to the\ndiverse needs of the smart grid infrastructure. We present a comprehensive\nperformance evaluation on a heterogeneous testbed featuring a powerful server\nand client (AMD Ryzen 5) and a resource-constrained client (Raspberry Pi). In\nefficient Deniable mode, the full handshake completes in 0.15 ms on the server\nand 0.41 ms on the Raspberry Pi client. In contrast, the Authenticated Mode is\nbottlenecked by the client-side signature generation; the handshake takes 4.8\nms for the Raspberry Pi client to initiate and 0.84 ms for the server to\nverify.", "AI": {"tldr": "AmphiKey\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 classical \ubc0f quantum \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc774\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud6c4\ub7c9\uc790/\uc804\ud1b5 \ud63c\ud569 \uc778\uc99d \ud0a4 \uad50\ud658 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \ubcf4\uc548 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "\uc778\uc99d \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc640 \ubd80\uc778 \uac00\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, ML-KEM-768\uacfc X25519 \ubc0f Raccoon DSA \ud0a4\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \ube44\ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \uc815\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ubd80\uc778 \uac00\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub294 \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0\uc11c 0.15 ms, Raspberry Pi \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c 0.41 ms\uc758 \ud578\ub4dc\uc170\uc774\ud06c \uc644\ub8cc \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AmphiKey\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AmphiKey\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 classical \ubc0f quantum \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc774\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud6c4\ub7c9\uc790/\uc804\ud1b5 \ud63c\ud569 \uc778\uc99d \ud0a4 \uad50\ud658 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998(AKEM)\uc774\ub2e4.

A crucial design choice in the training\nphase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are\ngenerated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a\nproposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed\nLangevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of\nthe annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration\nand thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose\ncontinuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques\ndeveloped in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal\ndistributions.

The primary goal is to\novercome limitations inherent in conventional solutions such as TPA,\nBlockchain, ECDSA and ZSS which often fall short in terms of data protection,\ncomputational efficiency and scalability. Our proposed method strategically\nrefines and integrates these technologies to address their shortcomings while\nmaximizing their individual strengths. By doing so we create a more reliable\nand high-performance framework for secure data exchange across heterogeneous\nenvironments. The model leverages the combined potential of emerging\ntechnologies, particularly Blockchain, IoT and Cloud computing which when\neffectively coordinated offer significant advancements in security\narchitecture. The proposed framework consists of three core layers: (1) the\nH.E.EZ Layer which integrates improved versions of Hyperledger Fabric,\nEnc-Block and a hybrid ECDSA-ZSS scheme to improve encryption speed,\nscalability and reduce computational cost; (2) the Credential Management Layer\nindependently verifying data integrity and authenticity; and (3) the Time and\nAuditing Layer designed to reduce traffic overhead and optimize performance\nacross dynamic workloads. Evaluation results highlight that the proposed\nsolution not only strengthens security but also significantly improves\nexecution time, communication efficiency and system responsiveness, offering a\nrobust path forward for next-generation IoT-Cloud infrastructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 IoT-\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uce35 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubcf4\uc548 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\ub4e4\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud558\uc774\ud37c\ub808\uc800 \ud328\ube0c\ub9ad, Enc-Block \ubc0f \ud63c\ud569 ECDSA-ZSS \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 H.E.EZ Layer, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uacfc \uc9c4\uc704\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 Credential Management Layer, \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 Time and Auditing Layer\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc751\ub2f5\uc131\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 IoT-\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 IoT-\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uce35 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubcf4\uc548 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\uc885 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc778 TPA, \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778, ECDSA \ubc0f ZSS\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c \ubc0f \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc810 \ud574\uacb0\uacfc \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd \uac04\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad50\ud658\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778, IoT \ubc0f \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\uc220\ub4e4\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ub420 \ub54c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc635\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uacc4\uce35\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ub808\uc800 \ud328\ube0c\ub9ad, Enc-Block \ubc0f \ud63c\ud569 ECDSA-ZSS \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c H.E.EZ Layer;

Recent studies have begun to explore using large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to\nstatic graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of\nreasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced\nLearning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that\nfine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.\nReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning\nstrategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly\njustify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning\ntraces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an\nLLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the\nimpact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning\nQwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier\nLLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality\nexplanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9c1\ud06c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc7ac\uad50\uc721 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub178\ub825\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ReaL-TG\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ReaL-TG-4B \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 LLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9c1\ud06c \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ub9c1\ud06c \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(TG) \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacfc\uac70\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uac00\uc624\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uad50\uc721 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ub2e4\uc218\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub098 \uc791\uc740 \ud569\uc131 TG\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc9c8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 ReaL-TG(\uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper examines\nenterprise readiness for quantum-safe cybersecurity through three perspectives:\n(i) the technologist view, assessing the maturity of post-quantum cryptography\n(PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD); (ii) the enterprise (CISO/CIO) view,\nanalyzing organizational awareness, risk management, and operational barriers;\nand (iii) the threat actor view, evaluating the evolving quantum threat and the\nurgency of migration. Using recent standards (e.g., NIST's 2024 PQC\nalgorithms), industry surveys, and threat intelligence, we synthesize findings\nvia a SWOT analysis to map strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\nResults indicate uneven and generally insufficient preparedness: while PQC\nstandards and niche QKD deployments signal technical progress, fewer than 5\\%\nof enterprises have formal quantum-transition plans, and many underestimate\n\"harvest now, decrypt later\" risks. Financial, telecom, and government sectors\nhave begun migration, but most industries remain exploratory or stalled by\ncosts, complexity, and skills gaps. Expert consensus places cryptanalytically\nrelevant quantum computers in the 2030s, yet delayed preparation could leave\ntoday's data vulnerable for decades. We recommend immediate steps: establishing\ncrypto-agility, creating quantum transition roadmaps, prioritizing PQC\ndeployment in high-value systems, and upskilling cybersecurity teams. A\ncoordinated, proactive approach is essential to secure current and future\ndigital assets in the quantum era.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc774 \uace0\uc804 \uc554\ud638\ud559\uc5d0 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc591\uc790 \uc548\uc804 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc5c5 \uc900\ube44 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uae30\uc220\uc790\uc758 \uad00\uc810, \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uad00\uc810, \uc704\ud611 \ud589\uc704\uc790\uc758 \uad00\uc810. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc900\ube44\uac00 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uce58\uac00 \uad8c\uc7a5\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc740 \uace0\uc804 \uc554\ud638\ub97c \ud30c\uad34\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc900\ube44 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PQC\uc640 QKD\uc758 \uc131\uc219\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\uc220\uc790 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \uae30\uc5c5 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uc704\ud611\uacfc \ub9c8\uc774\uadf8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uae34\uae09\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud611 \ud589\uc704\uc790 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)\ncorrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In\nthis paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates\nIPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)\nobjective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method\n(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and\ndemonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased\nexposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme\npropensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic\nand MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under\nunbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and\nstandard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning\nand evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub85c\uadf8\ub41c \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub178\ucd9c \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub85c\uadf8\ub41c \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub178\ucd9c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 IPS \uac00\uc911 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc Propensity Regularizer (PR)\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c IPS \uac00\uc911 Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 IPS \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ub354 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucd94\ucc9c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub85c\uadf8\ub41c \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub178\ucd9c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ed \ud655\ub960 \uc810\uc218(IPS)\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \ub192\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\uacfc \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 IPS \uac00\uc911 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc Propensity Regularizer (PR)\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c IPS \uac00\uc911 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc21c\uc704(BPR) \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811 \ubc29\ubc95(DM), IPS, \ubc0f \uc790\uae30 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 IPS(SNIPS)\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, IPS \uac00\uc911 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub41c \ub178\ucd9c \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c PR\uc740 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ud5a5 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc99d\ud3ed\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 MovieLens 100K \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub178\ucd9c \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uba70, \uc21c\uc9c4\ud55c \ubc0f \ud45c\uc900 IPS \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \ucd94\ucc9c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, their proficiency in complex\ncausal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active\ndevelopment, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious\ncorrelations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or\npersonalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the\ncollaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are\nemerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper\nexplores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these\nsystems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal\nreasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the\nestimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns\nand interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate\nframeworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.\nFurthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse\napplication domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,\nincluding scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized\nsystems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research\nquestions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to\nprovide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \uadf8 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ubc1c\uacac \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131 \uac15\uc870.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860, \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4 \ubd84\uc11d, \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac, \uc778\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0.", "result": "\uacfc\ud559 \ubc1c\uacac, \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4, \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uc640 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ubc1c\uc804 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801 \uac1c\uc694\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860, \ubc1c\uacac \ubc0f \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ud658\uac01, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4 \uc758\uc874, \ubbf8\ubb18\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778-specific \ub610\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub9ac\ubdf0 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM\uc758 \uc131\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc57c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4 \ubd84\uc11d, \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac, \uc778\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc \ucd94\uc815 \ub4f1 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubd05\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 \ucc98\ub9ac, \ud1a0\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd \ubc0f \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc815\uc81c \ub8e8\ud504 \ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uacfc\ud559 \ubc1c\uacac, \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4, \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM\uc774 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860, \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c, \uc5f4\ub9b0 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c8\ubb38 \ubc0f \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70 \ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uada4\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc694\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Oblivious\nMaps (OMAPs) mitigate this by fully hiding access patterns but suffer from high\noverhead due to randomized remapping and worst-case padding. We argue these\ncosts are not fundamental. Modern accelerators featuring High-Bandwidth Memory\n(HBM) offer a new opportunity: Vaswani et al. [OSDI'18] point out that\neavesdropping on HBM is difficult -- even for physical attackers -- as its\nmemory channels are sealed together with processor cores inside the same\nphysical package. Later, Hunt et al. [NSDI'20] show that, with proper\nisolation, HBM can be turned into an unobservable region where both data and\nmemory traces are hidden. This motivates a rethink of OMAP design with\nHBM-backed solutions to finally overcome their traditional performance limits.\nBuilding on these insights, we present BOLT, a Bandwidth Optimized,\nLightning-fast OMAP accelerator that, for the first time, achieves O(1) +\nO((log log N)^2) bandwidth overhead. BOLT introduces three key innovations: (i)\na new OMAP algorithm that leverages isolated HBM as an unobservable cache to\naccelerate oblivious access to large host memory; (ii) a self-hosted\narchitecture that offloads execution and memory control from the host to\nmitigate CPU-side leakage; and (iii) tailored algorithm-architecture co-designs\nthat maximize resource efficiency. We implement a prototype BOLT on a Xilinx\nU55C FPGA. Evaluations show that BOLT achieves up to 279x and 480x speedups in\ninitialization and query time, respectively, over state-of-the-art OMAPs,\nincluding an industry implementation from Facebook.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 HBM(High-Bandwidth Memory)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 OMAP(Oblivious Maps) \uac00\uc18d\uae30 BOLT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ud328\ud134 \ub204\ucd9c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud658\uacbd(TEE)\uc774 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc811\uadfc \ud328\ud134 \uc720\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "HBM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc811\uadfc \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc228\uae30\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 OMAP \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc CPU \uce21\uc758 \ub204\ucd9c\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud55c \uc790\uac00 \ud638\uc2a4\ud305 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998-\uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "BOLT\ub294 Xilinx U55C FPGA\uc5d0 \uad6c\ud604\ub418\uc5b4 \uae30\uc874 OMAP\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd08\uae30\ud654 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 279\ubc30, \ucffc\ub9ac \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 480\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "BOLT\ub294 HBM \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874 OMAP\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ube60\ub978 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc811\uadfc \ud328\ud134 \uc720\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.

Reinterpreting Diffusion Models Through Wasserstein Gradient Flow Matching", "comment": null, "summary": "Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,\ni.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption\nimplies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is\nnot enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present\nnumerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and\ndifferential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that\nthe learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models\nperform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent\nparadox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is\nbetter understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein\nGradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time\nstochastic differential equation. Under this view, the \"probability flow\"\narises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke\nreverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains\nsuccessful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further\nshow that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily\nharm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective\nas a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for\nunderstanding diffusion generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud655\uc0b0

When working with data, agents employ a\nhigh-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given\ntask, one we call agentic speculation.

We\ntake advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,\ni.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number\nof new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,\nranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new\nagentic memory stores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc791\uc5c5\ub7c9\uc774 \ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uc2e0\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc791\uc5c5\ub7c9\uc774 \ub420 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ud574\uacb0\uc548 \ud615\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c '\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd94\uce21'\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ub978\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd94\uce21\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131(\uaddc\ubaa8, \uc774\uc9c8\uc131, \uc911\ubcf5\uc131, \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6b0\uc120 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5f0\uad6c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4, \ucffc\ub9ac \ucc98\ub9ac \uae30\uc220, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\ub4dc\ub97c \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub300\uc2e0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc55e\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc99d\uac00 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ud574\uacb0\uc548 \ud615\uc131\uc758 \uace0\ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub97c '\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd94\uce21'\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ub978\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd94\uce21\uc758 \ub9c9\ub300\ud55c \uc591\uacfc \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud558\uac8c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc801\uc751\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uaddc\ubaa8, \uc774\uc9c8\uc131, \uc911\ubcf5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd94\uce21\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc911\uc2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Unfortunately, despite abundant\nprior efforts proposing solutions achieving near-perfect accuracy, the reality\nis that countering malicious emails still remains an unsolved dilemma.\n  This \"open problem\" paper carries out a critical assessment of scientific\nworks in the context of phishing email detection. First, we focus on the\nbenchmark datasets that have been used to assess the methods proposed in\nresearch. We find that most prior work relied on datasets containing emails\nthat -- we argue -- are not representative of current trends, and mostly\nencompass the English language. Based on this finding, we then re-implement and\nre-assess a variety of detection methods reliant on machine learning (ML),\nincluding large-language models (LLM), and release all of our codebase -- an\n(unfortunately) uncommon practice in related research. We show that most such\nmethods achieve near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same\ndataset -- a result which intrinsically hinders development (how can future\nresearch outperform methods that are already near perfect?). To foster the\ncreation of \"more challenging benchmarks\" that reflect current phishing trends,\nwe propose E-PhishGEN, an LLM-based (and privacy-savvy) framework to generate\nnovel phishing-email datasets. We use our E-PhishGEN to create E-PhishLLM, a\nnovel phishing-email detection dataset containing 16616 emails in three\nlanguages. We use E-PhishLLM to test the detectors we considered, showing a\nmuch lower performance than that achieved on existing benchmarks -- indicating\na larger room for improvement. We also validate the quality of E-PhishLLM with\na user study (n=30). To sum up, we show that phishing email detection is still\nan open problem -- and provide the means to tackle such a problem by future\nresearch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c

Due to the limitations\nof offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often\nstruggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,\nwe propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances\ngeneralization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method\nincorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide\npolicy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based\nprompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge\nbase to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode\ntrajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral\npatterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as\nconditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling\nthe RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods\non unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and\nadaptability in diverse settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion(LLMDPD)\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uacfc\uc81c\ubcc4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion(LLMDPD) \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LLMDPD\ub294 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc640 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uc798 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub354\uc6b1 \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9c0\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uacbd\ud5d8\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion(LLMDPD)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc124\uba85\uacfc \uada4\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uada4\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0, \uae30\ubcf8 \uc804\uc774 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd \uc815\ucc45 \uc218\uc900 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 LLMDPD\uac00 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This\ninvolves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and\nthe execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to\ncreate a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by\nconsidering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution\nenvironment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the\nreactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while\nrepeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds\nsignificant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which\nfocuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,\nwhich focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an\ninterplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates\nself-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum\nlogic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,\ngiving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to\nquantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are\nformed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed\nquantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for\ncontrolling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

A recent\nstudy addresses this issue by introducing an augmented shuffle DP protocol,\nwhere users do not add noise and the shuffler performs random sampling and\ndummy data addition. However, it focuses on frequency estimation over\ncategorical data with a small domain and cannot be applied to a large domain\ndue to prohibitively high communication and computational costs.\n  In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a novel augmented shuffle DP\nprotocol called the FME (Filtering-with-Multiple-Encryption) protocol. Our FME\nprotocol uses a hash function to filter out unpopular items and then accurately\ncalculates frequencies for popular items. To perform this within one round of\ninteraction between users and the shuffler, our protocol carefully communicates\nwithin a system using multiple encryption. We also apply our FME protocol to\nmore advanced KV (Key-Value) statistics estimation with an additional technique\nto reduce bias. For both categorical and KV data, we prove that our protocol\nprovides computational DP, high robustness to the above two attacks, accuracy,\nand efficiency.

Numeral examples suggested that integrating\nsuch residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction\nin the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence\nrates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational\nprecision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and\ncannot be adequately explained.\n  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical\nperspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz\ncontinuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the\nloss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a\nset of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.\n  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory\nprediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel, stealthy, and cost-effective attack to generate both targeted\nand untargeted adversarial infrared perturbations. By projecting perturbations\nfrom a transparent film onto the target object with an off-the-shelf infrared\nflashlight, our approach is the first to reliably mount laser-free targeted\nattacks in the infrared domain. Extensive experiments on traffic signs in the\ndigital and physical domains show that our approach is robust and yields higher\nattack success rates in various attack scenarios across bright lighting\nconditions, distances, and angles compared to prior work. Equally important,\nour attack is highly cost-effective, requiring less than US\\$50 and a few tens\nof seconds for deployment.

Improper initialization can cause permanent\nneuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network\ndepth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization\npreserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not\nnecessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,\nand their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work\nintroduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by\nsolving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving\nscale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family\nof closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.\nTheoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU\nproblem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient\nvanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep\narchitectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular\ndatasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method\noutperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep\nnetworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 ReLU \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c1\uad50 \ucd08\uae30\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ReLU \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uba70, \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc138\ud3ec \ube44\ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uae4a\uc774\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud560\uc218\ub85d \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Stiefel \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec ReLU\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc9c1\uad50 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c dying ReLU \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc608\ubc29\ud558\uace0, \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc758 \uac10\uc18c \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2a6\ucd94\uba70, \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc18c\uba78\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MNIST, Fashion-MNIST \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804 \ucd08\uae30\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \uae4a\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "ReLU \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub294 \uc601\uad6c\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc138\ud3ec \ube44\ud65c\uc131\ud654(dying ReLU)\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uae4a\uc774\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their\nvaried interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through\ncomplex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack\ndiversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To\naddress this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based\nadventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the\nobservation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier\ngameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay\nevaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to\nbetter plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents\nstruggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by\nbridging the observation-behavior gap.

Various methods have\nimplemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the\nrobustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying\nperturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently\nminimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the\nadversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in\nenhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has\nbeen largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we\npropose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial\nperturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and\nimproving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation\noperations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified\nframework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods.

While recent Agentic\nReinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address\nmulti-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases\nthat suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited\nextensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community\nadoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and\nmodular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design\nprinciples. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment\nwith VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool\nmanagement via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code\nexecution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous\nrollout execution achieving near 2$\\times$ speedup by eliminating\nsynchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating\ncompetitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as\nmulti-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),\nextending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on\nmathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web\nsearch, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to\nspecialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure.

In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly\ndisclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)\nreports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is\nessential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with\nimmediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is\ninfeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying\nvulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate\nthat the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior\nclassification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an\nF1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7.

This is an extended version of the\n  original submission", "summary": "Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nacross distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data\nheterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation\npersonalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from\nclients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model\nstates. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid\noverfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even\ncollapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce\ntheir own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.\nTo this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called\nCurriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the\nclient side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges\nfor training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first\nto easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,\nclient-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased\npatterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,\nthe curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic\nknowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves\nweighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained\nstructural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive\nexperiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior\nperformance compared to relevant baselines.

Project page: https://robix-seed.github.io/robix/", "summary": "We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task\nplanning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language\narchitecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot\nsystem, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level\ncontroller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to\nfollow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally\nwith human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel\ncapabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and\ncontext-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix\nleverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training\nstrategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning\nabilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and\ntask-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot\ninteraction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)\nreinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon\ntask coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both\nopen-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in\ninteractive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse\ninstruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and\ninterrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery\nshopping, and dietary filtering.", "AI": {"tldr": "Robix\ub294 \ub85c\ubd07 \ucd94\ub860, \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e8\uc77c \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub85c\ubd07 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ub530\ub974\uace0, \uc7a5\uae30 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\uae09 \uc778\uc9c0 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Robix\ub294 3\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04-\ub85c\ubd07 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ucd94\ub860-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Robix\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828, \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Robix\ub294 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub85c\ubd07 \ucd94\ub860, \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Robix\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

We've examined most popular extensions -\nMinerBlock, AdGuard AdBlocker, Easy Redirect && Prevent Cryptojacking,\nCoinEater and Miners Shield, which claim to be designed specifically to\nidentify and stop illegal cryptocurrency mining. An empirically confirmed\ndataset of 373 distinct cryptojacking-infected websites which was assembled\nduring multi-stage procedure, was used to test those extensions. The results\nshowed that all plugins in question had significant performance limits.

This bias disproportionately\npreserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training\ninstability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training\nframework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to\nefficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad\ndistributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning\nrates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better\ncapture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range\nregularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range\ndistribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8\ntraining surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy\ncomparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under\nadvanced low-bit quantization.

They allow a user to\nhave a message signed by a signer without revealing the message itself. This\nproperty is particularly useful in applications such as electronic voting and\ndigital cash, where user anonymity is important. In a blind signature scheme,\nthe user blinds their message before sending it to the signer, who signs the\nblinded message. The user then unblinds the signed message to obtain a valid\nsignature that can be verified publicly, ensuring that the signer cannot trace\nthe signed message back to the original unblinded version. A good analogy is\nplacing the message inside an envelope and having the envelope signed. Once the\nenvelope is opened, the signature remains valid for the enclosed message,\nensuring that the content remains confidential.\n  Such constructions provide anonymity and privacy to the user but given a\npractical quantum computer, the security of traditional crypto-systems\nproviding such features will be broken. To address this, the development of\nquantum-resistant cryptographic protocols is essential for maintaining the\nsecurity of digital transactions and data. Aligning with the same goal, this\nwork aims to thoroughly review the background of lattice-based blind\nsignatures. We start with the foundations of digital signatures in the\nclassical settings and then move on to lattice-based constructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uaca9\uc790 \uae30\ubc18 \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \uc11c\uba85\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc30\uacbd\uc744 \ucca0\uc800\ud788 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc554\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc774 \uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uae68\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc554\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130\uc758 \ub4f1\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc11c\uba85\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec \ud6c4 \uaca9\uc790 \uae30\ubc18 \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \uc11c\uba85 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uaca9\uc790 \uae30\ubc18 \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \uc11c\uba85\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\uacbd \uac80\ud1a0\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uac70\ub798\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc751\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c, \uc591\uc790 \uc800\ud56d \uc554\ud638 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \uc11c\uba85\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ube44\ub4dc \ucc28\uc6c0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ucc98\uc74c \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uc11c\uba85\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc11c\uba85\ubc1b\uc544 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ub178\ucd9c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc18d\uc131\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc775\uba85\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc804\uc790 \ud22c\ud45c \ubc0f \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud604\uae08\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \uc720\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \uc11c\uba85 \uccb4\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \uc11c\uba85\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\ub0b4\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70, \uc11c\uba85\uc790\ub294 \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \ucc98\ub9ac\ub41c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc11c\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc11c\uba85\ub41c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \ud574\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uac1c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc11c\uba85\uc744 \uc5bb\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c\uc368 \uc11c\uba85\uc790\ub294 \uc11c\uba85\ub41c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \ud574\uc81c\ub41c \ubc84\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc801\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc88b\uc740 \ube44\uc720\ub294 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd09\ud22c\uc5d0 \ub123\uace0 \ubd09\ud22c\uc5d0 \uc11c\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc778\ub370, \ubd09\ud22c\uac00 \uc5f4\ub9ac\uba74 \uc11c\uba85\uc740 \ub2eb\ud78c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc720\ud6a8\ud558\uac8c \ub0a8\uc544 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uac00 \ube44\ubc00\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc775\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130\uac00 \uc0dd\uae30\uba74 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc554\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \uae68\uc9c8 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uac70\ub798\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc591\uc790 \uc800\ud56d \uc554\ud638 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac19\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uaca9\uc790 \uae30\ubc18 \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \uc11c\uba85\uc758 \ubc30\uacbd\uc744 \ucca0\uc800\ud788 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc11c\uba85\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\uc73c\ub85c \uaca9\uc790 \uae30\ubc18 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac11\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We study multi-action\npartially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of\nthe classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite\nstates, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite\nactions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for\neach bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health\nintervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term\ndiscounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves\naccording to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The\nstate of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals\nare observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that\nbandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are\nassumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent\nthrough the budget constraint.\n  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable\nrestless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,\nfinite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian\nbounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of\nLagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout\npolicy.

We implement this second\ndefense into Firefox, demonstrating that it protects the FIDO2 protocol against\nXSS attacks and malicious extensions.

F. Tan"], "title": "Memory Limitations of Prompt Tuning in Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained\nlanguage models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain\nlimited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation\nproperties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this\npaper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the\nmemorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical\ncontributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a\ntransformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length.

However, their dependence on static\ntraining corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating\nexternal knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which\nprovide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG\napproaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to\ninitiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings\nwhere accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To\novercome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent\ncollaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor\nentities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate\nanchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes\nindependent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from\neach candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval\nstrategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge\npaths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework\nimproves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or\nerroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate\nthat AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new\nstate-of-the-art results on the real-world question

We investigated chip-level hardware malicious\npayload in embedded systems and proposed a supervised machine learning method\nto detect malicious bitstreams via static byte-level features. Our approach\ndiverges from existing methods by analyzing bitstreams directly at the binary\nlevel, enabling real-time detection without requiring access to source code or\nnetlists. Bitstreams were sourced from state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks and\nre-engineered to target the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA Development Board. Our dataset\nincluded 122 samples of benign and malicious configurations.

In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends\nto emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard\nautoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing\nstages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to\nIARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most\nmemorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction\nfrom IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images.

As a result, the field of video production is\nundergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models\nare typically constrained by high computational costs.\n  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show\nvideo generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline\nthrough the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of\na suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of\nvideo generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.\nThese agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming\nuser-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.\n  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam\nachieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while\nsubstantially reducing computational overhead.

Recent advances in\nspatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate\nspatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most\nprevious studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling\nspatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which\nhave neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial\ncorrelations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies\nfail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and\nRegional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic\nforecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion\nframework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to\ncapture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective\nfrom the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with\npositive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional\nnetwork based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a\nregional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with\nregional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional\nheterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network.

To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as\nBest-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the\nassumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple\nattempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting\neither the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or\nthe most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models\n(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic\ncorrectness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model\npredictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL\nremains largely underexplored.\n  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare\nthem with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the\nText-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,\nfinetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3\nmodel families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving\nexecution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and\n+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that\nfinetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields\nsuperior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve\ncompetitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number\nof candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

A common approach to handle this issue is to\nrely on GUI models to generate event sequences. These sequences can be\neffective in covering GUI states, but inconsistent in exposing program\nbehaviors that require specific inputs. A major obstacle to generate such\nspecific inputs is the lack of a systematic GUI exploration process to\naccommodate the analysis requirements. In this paper, we introduce Android Path\nExplorer (APEX), a systematic input generation framework using concolic\nexecution. APEX addresses the limitations of model-based sequence generation by\nusing concolic execution to discover the data dependencies of GUI state\ntransitions. Moreover, concolic execution is also used to prioritize events\nduring the exploration of GUI, which leads to a more robust model and accurate\ninput generation. The key novelty of APEX is that concolic execution is not\nonly used to construct event sequences, but also used to traverse the GUI more\nsystematically. As such, our experimental results show that APEX can be used to\ngenerate a set of event sequences that achieve high code coverage, as well as\nevent sequences that reach specific targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "APEX\ub294 \uc548\ub4dc\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc GUI \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc785\ub825 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ucf54\ub4dc \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc548\ub4dc\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc GUI \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "APEX\ub294 \ucee8\ucf5c\ub9ad \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "APEX\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \ubc1c\uacac \uc911\uc5d0 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\uc640 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "APEX\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c GUI\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub3c4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc548\ub4dc\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc GUI \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 GUI \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub294 GUI \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucee4\ubc84\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc785\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \ub178\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\uc815 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc740 \ubd84\uc11d \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc218\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 GUI \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucee8\ucf5c\ub9ad \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc548\ub4dc\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \uacbd\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uae30(APEX)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured\ntokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models\ncapture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a \"bag of\ngenes\" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose\na Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene\nlevel. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%\nreduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment\nconditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by\nencoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.\nFinally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five\ngene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw\ntime-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological\nhypotheses directly from experimental data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GAT(\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc8fc\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, MLP\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc720\uc804\uc790-\uc720\uc804\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "GAT(\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc8fc\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GAT\ub294 MLP\ubcf4\ub2e4 MSE\ub97c 81% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GAT \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 TP53-MDM2-MDM4 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc7ac\ubc1c\uacac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uac00\uc124 \uc0dd\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc778\uac04 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub9e4\ud551\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc720\uc804\uc790\ub97c \ube44\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uacbd\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uacbd\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacbd\ub85c \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uac01 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c '\uc720\uc804\uc790\uc758 \uac00\ubc29'\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8 \uc815\ud615\uacfc \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc8fc\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(GAT) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GAT\uac00 MLP\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc5b4, \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ucc98\ub9ac \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub85c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \ub54c MSE\ub97c 81% \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc57d\ubb3c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc0ac\uc804\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GAT \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 mRNA \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c TP53-MDM2-MDM4 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc7ac\ubc1c\uacac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uac00\uc124\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Since\ncomputational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted\nviolations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast\nmachine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the\nsatisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.\nHowever, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal\ndynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others\ncritically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so\nwould yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack\nmeaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we\npresent GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically\nscore-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and\nmulti-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM\nemploys a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical\nmode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically\nvalid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nGenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,\nresulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less\nconservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenQPM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc591\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ubcc4\ub85c \uc608\uce21 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ub098\ub208 \ud6c4 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uad6c\uac04\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc591\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1(QPM) \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uad6c\uac04\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "GenQPM\uc740 \ub525 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc810\uc218 \uae30\ubc18 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc811\uadfc \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ubcc4\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uace0, \uac01 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uad6c\uac04\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GenQPM\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4dc \ube44\uc778\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \uc720\uc775\ud55c(\ub35c \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc778) \uc608\uce21 \uad6c\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GenQPM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c QPM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc591\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1(QPM) \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc989, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac \uc18d\uc131\uc758 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\ub97c \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc5d0 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc608\uc0c1\ub41c \uc704\ubc18\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc2dc \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud575\uc2ec\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 QPM \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uad6c\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ube60\ub978 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub300\uccb4\ubb3c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c QPM \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubcf4\uc77c \ub54c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ub9cc\uc871 \uac12\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub294 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc704\ubc18\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 QPM \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ubb34\uad00\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ubcc4 \ub9cc\uc871 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc815\ubcf4\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uac04\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GenQPM\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uae4a\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378, \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc218 \uae30\ubc18 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc811\uadfc \uc5c6\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.

In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by\nself-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by\ndeveloping a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to\ncause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated\nLearning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the\nperformance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own\nmodels within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named\nFedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading\nmodified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the\nprivate model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where\n\"divergence\" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that\nintegrate global updates and local knowledge.

Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires\nsignificant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use\nproprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no\nextra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering\nto help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The\nconstruction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting\nhistorical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these\nCoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.\nAs a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with\ntheir corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve\nspecification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them\ninto the inference process.

Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%\nhigher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the\nresulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk\nfirms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual\nrecords. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering\nalgorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with\n{\\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02.

Despite these strides,\nevaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to\nthe difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture\nresearchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we\nintroduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that\ncapture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world\nresearch environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically\nconstruct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task\nGeneration (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from\nseminar transcripts.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a\ncomprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual\nsources.

Yet providers must protect\ntheir services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web\nagents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on\nagents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.\nWe start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that\nare asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a\ncommon component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve\nreasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,\nwe find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates\nfails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based\nReasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over\nworld knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable\ngeneration and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework\nachieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x\nhigher than the generation cost for SOTA models.

These applications place higher demands on model compression\nand inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,\ndue to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs\nface challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies\nlearned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To\naddress these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self\nAttention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier\nKAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.\nThrough the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift\nmechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves\nits nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational\ncomplexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based\non teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive\nweighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the\nstudent model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD\nachieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models\nand 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark\nmodels, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%\ndecrease in inference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data\nperturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly\nutilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and\ndiversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data\nutility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation\nand data utility remains a critical challenge.\n  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework\nfor the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on\ndata utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the\nupper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that\nperturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining\nfidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs\nlocal extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of\nindividual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted\nprivacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our\nmethod effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are\nvulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we\nachieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive\nexperimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances\nresistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in\nterms of sample quality and

We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality\nin high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the\nknown transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave\nripple events in real-world data.

We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization\n(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between\nintermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,\noperator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping \"+\" with \"-\")\nduring training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under\nlogically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per\nsample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome\nSensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model\npredictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical\ndeduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness\nby up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process\nsupervision, with only minor accuracy loss.

This drives the need for robust\nfine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse\nlabeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties\nthat complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training\ndatasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which\nrequire enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse\nobjectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better\nunderstand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we\nclassify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,\nrepresentation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on\ndownstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and\nself-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive\nevaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined\nrobust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of\nsimple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble\nfine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types\nwhile

To be published in Nature Scientific\n  Reports", "summary": "With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to\ndecision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the\naerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the\nethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable\nand justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to\naddressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured\ndecision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The\nproposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous\ndecision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing\nconcepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's\nperformance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based\ninsights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,\nvolunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured\ndecision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently\naccurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based\nsystems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms\nhuman operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These\nfindings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework\nfor building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical\ncontexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc548\uc804-critical \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ud568\uc758\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0dd\uba85\uc774 \uac78\ub9b0 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud560 \ub54c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc815\ub2f9\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ud568\uc758\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f0 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc7ac\ub09c \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud310\ub2e8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c 60.94% \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uac04 \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 38.93% \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc548\uc804-critical \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc774 \ud56d\uacf5\uc6b0\uc8fc \ubc0f \uae34\uae09 \ub300\uc751 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc548\uc804-critical \uc601\uc5ed\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc624\ub3c4\ub85d \uc801\uc6a9\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc778\uac04 \uc0dd\uba85\uc774 \uc704\ud611\ubc1b\uc744 \ub54c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ud568\uc758\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc694\uccad\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 AI\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc7ac\ub09c \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uad6c\ud604\ub41c\ub2e4.

Total Electron\nContent (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,\nbut its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global\nmeasurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during\nstrong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning\nframework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion\nTransformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates\nheterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,\nand GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment\nstrategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves\nrobust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as\n3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest\npredictive signals.

Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to\nexploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of\ncontrolled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known\nas \"Jailbreak.\" While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak\nattacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the\nexact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel\nneuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related\nknowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's\ninternal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary\nspace. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can\neffectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that\nreinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against\njailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across\nmultiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses.

Since degradation\nis rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate\nhealth assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because\noperational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces\nonly subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect\nshort-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the\nunderlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but\nthe residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in\nnoisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with\ndynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising\nframework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in\nslow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,\nwhile degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation\n(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)\nCDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a\nmulti-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a\nlearnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to\ncontrol degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces\nmonotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.\nThrough comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and\nsteady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively\ndisentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms\nresidual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable\ninference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uc13c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c

The mist of\ndata privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,\nand for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research\nproposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the\ncompliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy\npolicies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of\nsuch formal policies at scale.

We also demonstrate how the $\\mathit{Pr}^2\\mathit{Graph}$ can be used\nto support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such\nas Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use\n(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE\ndataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations.

Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method\nfor OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the\naction space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are\nunderexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate\nthis issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not\nminimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider\ncontext information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action\nEmbedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action\nembeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.\nBuilding on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present\nan MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS.

Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks\nposed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and\nrelying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come\nfrom non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,\nself-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly\ninfluence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,\nescalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce\nConstructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects\nagainst malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe\nand helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic\nanticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and\ninterpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.\nOy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high\ngeneral capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong\nconstructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the\nStrata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from\nrefusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user\nrelationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully\nhelpful.

Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better\nand better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development\nevolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of\nleveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing\nversion of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative\nAdversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural\nCellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we\npropose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with\nsome appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing\ndata imputation problem.

While machine\nlearning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional\nforecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use\ndifferent datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and\nreproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for\ndata-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent.\nIndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution\nregional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and\nprobabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To\nestablish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across\ndiverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,\nas well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.\nWhile focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other\ngeographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model\nimplementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future\ndevelopment.

While\nphysics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep\nOperator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to\ntraditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and\nphysics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and\nproviding uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these\nlimitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to\nadaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)\nreplica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global\nparameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in\nBayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed\noperator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems\nincluding one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed\ndiffusion-wave equation.

To address the\nlack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a\nblack-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given\nan ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset\nof scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's\nalignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges\nthe outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are\naggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a\nweighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground\ntruth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges\nmay disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether\nEigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that\nmost of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual\nquantifies the disposition of the model itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\uc640 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \uc815\ub82c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 EigenBench\ub77c\ub294 \ube44\uad50 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uc640 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "EigenBench\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ube44\uad50 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14, \uac00\uce58 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ud5cc\ubc95, \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud5cc\ubc95 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc810\uc218 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ubc18\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud310\ub2e8\uc740 EigenTrust\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9d1\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc804\uccb4\uc758 \uac00\uc911 \ud3c9\uade0 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EigenBench \uc810\uc218\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub354 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc131\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc740 \uc794\uc5ec\uac12\ub3c4 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI\uc640 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uae34\uae09\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac00\uce58 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ube44\uad50 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 EigenBench\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14, \uac00\uce58 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ud5cc\ubc95, \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud5cc\ubc95 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc810\uc218 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ubc18\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud310\ub2e8\uc740 EigenTrust(Kamvar et al, 2003)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9d1\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc804\uccb4\uc758 \uac00\uc911 \ud3c9\uade0 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We\nevaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with\nexperimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056\nmolecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates\nnovel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of\n8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with\nthe best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor\n($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl\npharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)\nconfirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes\nto kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than\nestablished drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE\nand MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity\nhighlights the superior performance of our method.

To address this gap, our\ncontributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,\ncontrolled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from\nMIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and\nthree context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -\nMulti-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness\nfor three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and\nLatent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated\nFairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs\nbetween fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four\nopen-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and\ntheir finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our\nfindings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more\neffectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust\nperformance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but\ndeteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and\nevaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for\nhealthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc

Accepted at IEEE International\n  Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025", "summary": "In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or\nsensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and\nrequires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and\ntransparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing\ndownstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this\nlearning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data\nReprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target\nattribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction\naccuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating\nhigh-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large\nsearch space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from\nutility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative\nlearning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to\ndiscover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any\nregard to privacy inferability.

While\ndecomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional\nnetwork (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from\ncomputational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these\nlimitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms\niterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.\nOur key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces\niterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition\ntime (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable\nbandwidth constraints ({\\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate\nmanual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST\nbenchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction\nin the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ub4dc \uc801\uc751 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(MAGN)\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc5bd\ud798\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub4dc \uc801\uc751 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(MAGN)\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubd84\ud574(VMD)\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc73c\ub85c\ub294, \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uae4a\uc774\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ud3bc\uccd0\uc9c4 VMD(UPMD) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \uacf5\uac04 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\uba74\uc11c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uacb9\uce68\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ubcc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "MAGN\uc740 LargeST \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c(6,902 \uac1c \uc13c\uc11c, 241M \uad00\uce21)\uc5d0\uc11c VMGCN\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 85-95%\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ucc28 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 MAGN\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc218\ub9ce\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc5bd\ud798\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcc0\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(VMGCN)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc218\ub3d9 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubd84\ud574(VMD)\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc801\uc751 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(MAGN)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc740 (1) \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uae4a\uc774 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uad50\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ud3bc\uccd0\uc9c4 VMD(UPMD) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc (2) \uacf5\uac04 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\uba74\uc11c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uacb9\uce68\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ubcc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \uc81c\uc57d({\theta}k )\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4.

However, their uptake in Law has\nproven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and\ntransparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a\nviable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of\ntacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information\nretrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking\nand augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an\nengineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for\neach question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem\nwith the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse\nCardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose\nmodel to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase\nreliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black\nbox effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\\% better than the previously\npresented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the\nlimiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,\nserving as a call to action for future research.

Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The\nStability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance\nbetween the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The\nResource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on\nextensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource\nburden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies\nnot in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically\nmodulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that\nlightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning\nprocess. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive\nModulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new\npath for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural\nSynapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to\nstore expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these\nmodulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a\nsimilar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it\nselects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task.

However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer\nfrom oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of\nthe belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing\ntheir effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an\nenhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations\nthrough two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that\nutilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership\nfunction construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a\ntailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform\nthe possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from\nnormalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible\nrepresentation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief\nstructure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors\nclassifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into\ndecision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted\nto evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier\nand the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with\nboth evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The\nresults demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing\nevidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,\nwhile maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and\nrobustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Dempster-Shafer \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc18d\uc131 \uc735\ud569

This paper\npresents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in\nlink prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms\nthat consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a\nreinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within\na KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific\nontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in\nestablished biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing\nusing three popular knowledge graph benchmarks.

Prior studies suggest that\nmodeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily\nand improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on\npolynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order\ninteractions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge\ndirectionality and expressive message passing on node classification in\nheterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a\npolynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant\n(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models\nare designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over\ninput features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.\nExperiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model\nconsistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers\nadditional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),\nachieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,\nintroducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the\nbenefit of directional message passing is context-dependent.

While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their\napplication has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within\nhuman-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open\nquestion. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy\nprocess, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the\nscoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior\nwork may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of\nLLM capabilities.

Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of\nground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative\ndeep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has\nbeen commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions\nto evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal\ndependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,\nTARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce\nProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and\nnon-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,\nT-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known\nground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an\nensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs\nshows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are\npresent.

However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on\ntime-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on\ndiverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a\nsingle image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.\nUnlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns\nusing architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the\nnext chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using\ndiffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the\ngenerated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of\nleveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our\nfindings motivate further research to address the current limitations and\nexpand their applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud328\ud134\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc2dd \uac00\uaca9 \ucd94\uc138\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae08\uc735 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc8fc\ub85c Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ub2e4\uc74c \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \ube44\uad50 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae08\uc735 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc751\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ud3b8\uc9d1, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae08\uc735 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uacc4\uc18d\ud574\uc11c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud328\ud134\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc2dd \uac00\uaca9 \ucd94\uc138 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, the applicability of FL systems\nis hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity\nthat can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed\npredictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey\nthus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,\nclient, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and\nlimitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques\nutilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training\nprocess. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,\ntheoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and\ntheir adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments.

We present an exploratory study into the application of\npost-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band\nselection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive\nperformance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each\nband's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion\nevaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or\nreintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the\nhighest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy\nand improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University\nand Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected\nbands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational\nrequirements.

On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%\nto 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among\nfeedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit\naction-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory\nlength.

Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately\npredicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an\nessential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains\nelusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a\nset $\\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline\nstructure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally\nexpensive, iterative flow-matching approaches.

IEEE, 2025", "summary": "Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models\nare increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While\nSHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,\nit fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often\nmisattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We\npropose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships\ninto feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By\ncombining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the\nIntervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal\nstrength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.\nSpecifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are\nmerely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of\nExplainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model\nexplanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as\nhealthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for\ninformed decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "Causal SHAP\uc740 SHAP\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ML \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac74\uac15 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c ML \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc84c\ub2e4.", "method": "Causal SHAP\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Peter-Clark (PC) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uc778\uacfc \uac15\ub3c4 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec SHAP\uc758 \uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Causal SHAP\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \ub300\uc0c1\uacfc \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc5ec \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AI(XAI) \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 ML \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc758\ub8cc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\uce58\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc84c\ub2e4.

This paper identifies four core problems that must be\nsolved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)\ngeneralization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,\nspecifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)\nlong-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,\nspecifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We\npresent AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device\nassistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,\nclosed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this\nposition through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,\ntraining, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile\napplication development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal\nfoundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and\ncontrol layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task\nplanning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution\nlayer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice\ninteraction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and\ncomprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates\nprofiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across\nheterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant\nimprovements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,\nhigher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,\nand faster, more resource-efficient runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AppCopilot\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc5f0\uc1c4\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AppCopilot\uc740 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub450 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654, \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc758 \ud654\uba74 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacfc\uc81c \uc644\ub8cc, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AppCopilot\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\ubd80\ud130 \ubc30\ud3ec, \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \ub05d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub05d\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc6b4\uc601\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \ud655\uc0b0\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc81c\ub4e4\uc774 \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4: (1) \uc791\uc5c5, \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0, \uc571 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uce58 \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654; (2) \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud654\uba74 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ud074\ub9ad \ud0c0\uac9f\ud305\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131; (3) \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30 \ub2a5\ub825; (4) \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 AppCopilot\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ubc94\uc6a9 \uc628\ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc73c\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\ubd80\ud130 \ubc30\ud3ec\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub85c\uc988\ub4dc \ub8e8\ud504 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.

This model is\ndesigned to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,\nleadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students\nwithin an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational\ndata from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the\nlimitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various\naward records into talent categories and extracting features from students'\ndiverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908\nclassification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of\nmachine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.", "AI": {"tldr": "Talent identification is crucial for student development, and this

While recent advances in\nnative agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,\naction, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data\nscalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of\nGUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we\npresent UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these\nchallenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for\nscalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI\nenvironment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox\nplatform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that\nUI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.\nOn GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on\nWindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines\nsuch as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean\nnormalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level\nperformance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,\nOpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to\nlong-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,\nhighlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of\ntraining dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and\nefficiency in large-scale agent RL.

The resulting\nmodel requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to\noverfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for\nsearching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm\nfor selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while\nsearching for counterfactuals.

This survey\nformalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step\nMarkov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,\npartially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.\nBuilding on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one\norganized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,\nmemory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their\napplications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that\nreinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these\ncapabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic\nbehavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the\nlandscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a\npractical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this\nsurvey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the\nopportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,\ngeneral-purpose AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(Agentic RL)\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0

We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token\nRouting Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to\ndynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving\nlightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the\nattention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is\nexplicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This\ndesign offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense\nattention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through\nattention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full\nTransformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods\nsuch as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while\nrouting fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with\nsequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context\ninputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially\nreduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and\nscalable alternative to Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "DTRNet\ub294 \ud1a0\ud070\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\ucc28 \ud1a0\ud070 \ud63c\ud569\uc758 \uc81c\uacf1 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uac74\ub108\ub6f0\uba74\uc11c \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c Transformer \uad6c\uc870\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Transformer\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758(attention)\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ube44\uc309\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DTRNet\uc740 MLP \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc120\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc5ec, \uac01 \ud1a0\ud070\uc774 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \uacc4\uc0b0\ub7c9\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud6c8\ub828 \ud6c4 DTRNet \ube14\ub85d\uc740 \uac01 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 10%\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070\ub9cc \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 Transformer\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DTRNet\uc740 \uc8fc\uc758 \ud63c\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \uc81c\uacf1 \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc774\uba70, Transformer\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Transformers\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758\uac00 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ube44\uc309\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DTRNet(\ub3d9\uc801 \ud1a0\ud070 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud1a0\ud070\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\ucc28 \ud1a0\ud070 \ud63c\ud569\uc758 \uc81c\uacf1 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uac74\ub108\ub6f0\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c Transformer \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window\nattention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized\noperations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,\nthese methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their\ninability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT\n(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid\narchitecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and\napplies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token\nembedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that\nintegrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,\neach token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens\nthat summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity\nof full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory\ncost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT\nincurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate\nremains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We\nanalyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically\non long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba\nand SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same\ncomputational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling\nand common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT\nachieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering\ncomparable results on long sequence benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCOUT\ub294 \uace0\uc815 \ud06c\uae30 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \ub85c\uceec\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \uc555\ucd95\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub9cc \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "SCOUT\ub294 Mamba \ub610\ub294 SWA\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc120\ud615 \ub85c\uceec \ubbf9\uc11c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uadfc \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \ud1a0\ud070\uc774 \uc785\ub825 \ud788\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc694\uc57d\ud55c \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \uc555\ucd95 \uccb4\ud06c\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uae30\uc6b8\uc774\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SCOUT\ub294 \uac19\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uace0, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc0c1\uc2dd \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud480 \uc5b4\ud150\uc158 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uc640 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SCOUT\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc5d4\ub4dc\ud22c\uc5d4\ub4dc \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc81c\uacf1\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4.

Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1\nscores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to\nbe performed.\n  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and\noutlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to\nincrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that\nbetter aligns with the optimization objective.\n  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast\ndataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and\nalgorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique\n(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well\nas multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.\n  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On\ntabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests\n(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to\ntraining on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average\nof 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets.

The online decentralized federated\nlearning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,\nsuch as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data\ndistribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in\nreal-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine\nclients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only\nwhen the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of\nclients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients\nwithin a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is\npossible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'\nbehavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to\nachieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.\nTherefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated\nmulti-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency\nwhen the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.\nOur proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the\nreceived signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a\ntrust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.\nOur simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a\nByzantine-free setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Byzantine \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778

Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their\nrigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate\nneural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse\nand evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel\napproach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient\nmanifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture\nby integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and\nnon-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT\noutperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on\nSuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while\nsignificantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%.

MDMs generate\nsequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong\nperformance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do\nnot support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.\nTo this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a\ndiscrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible\nlength while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.\nGrounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs\ngenerate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them.

With data-driven approaches increasingly\naccelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting\nsynthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,\nexisting studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined\nfields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures\nare linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the\nstructural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,\nwe adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which\nsupports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures.

One of the major challenges hindering the real-world\ndeployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence\nof motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact\nremoval rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace\nReconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without\nincorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement\nunits (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This\nwork proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation\nattention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU\ndata to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model\ncontains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU\nrecordings for training, just 0.2346\\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base\nmodel.

When small\nlanguage models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they\nfrequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,\nsuch as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'\ndomain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language\nmodel--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized\nprograms contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then\napplies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood\ncomponents whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple\nprobabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models\n(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and\nstatistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source\nlarge language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).", "AI": {"tldr": "RefineStat\uc740 \uc815\ud569\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uacfc \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "RefineStat\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uc798 \ud615\uc131\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ud569\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uac80\uc0ac\uac00 \uc2e4\ud328\ud560 \ub54c\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc0ac\uc804 \ub610\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\ub3c4 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ub9ac\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc778\uc2dd \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(SLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c RefineStat\uac00 \uad6c\ubb38\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac74\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RefineStat\ub294 \ub2eb\ud78c \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(\uc608: OpenAI o3)\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\ubcc4 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc218\ubc18\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c, \uc885\uc885 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uad6c\ubb38 \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uacfc \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud569\uc131\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc774 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uc798 \ud615\uc131\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c RefineStat\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uac80\uc0ac\uac00 \uc2e4\ud328\ud560 \ub54c\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc0ac\uc804 \ub610\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\ub3c4 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ub9ac\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc778\uc2dd \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c RefineStat\uc774 \uad6c\ubb38\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac74\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \ub2eb\ud78c \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(\uc608: OpenAI o3)\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ub300\ub4f1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, current\napproaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to\nredundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their\ntask-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nframework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for\nimage transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract\nan invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the\nsource data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed\nrepresentation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features\nfor successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,\nwe utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent\nrepresentation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to\nvarious image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations\nare then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several\ndatasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,\nand achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under\ndifferent SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8

However, the current transfer learning model greatly\ndepends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical\napplication of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain\nAggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with\nDomain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature\ndecoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from\ndomain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training\nstage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature\nspace to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional\nEEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype\nrepresentation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning\nstrategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity\nproblem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of\nlabel noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen\nduring the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained\ndomain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We\nrigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and\nSEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\\%,\n68.11\\% and 61.08\\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better\nperformance than methods that rely on both source and target domains.

Current works in this field often\nrely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative\nloss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to\nmaintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.\nHowever, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data\nusually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax\nthese out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes\nperformative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential\ntheoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of\nperformative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to\nnonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution\nshift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two\ndistributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the\nperformative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for\nboth linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a\ncritical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these\ntheoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative\nstability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method\nthrough experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and\nnonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared

However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,\nhigher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks\nrarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity\ntheory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect\nGNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message\nPassing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty\nfor a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing.

To address these challenges, we introduce an\nin-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities\nof general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection\nstrategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples\noptimized to enhance model's performance on a given task.

While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally\nexpensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and\ngeometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning\nsolution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often\nfail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.\nHere we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the\nevolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,\nachieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global\nspectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and\nregulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics.

While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting\nthese signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because\nclinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable\nuncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals\n(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a\nmeaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical\ndecision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from\nthe Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure\nwell-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and\nsupport for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that\nprediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula\ndistribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,\nbased on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional\nerror distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these\nmethods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,\nrepresenting high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate\nthat the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction\nbaselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on\nhigh-frequency data.

To\nmitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization\npipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data\nselection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training\nsamples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During\nonline RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to\ndynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing\nsubstantial rollout computational costs.

We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages\nresurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural\ninformation from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the\nfactorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition\nfunctions encode precise information about all critical objective function\nvalue in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.\n  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition\nfunction $Z(g) = \\int e^{-L(\\theta)/g} d\\theta$ for small coupling $g\\ll 1$,\nextracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane\nsingularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function\nvalues. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,\nenabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal\nregions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded\nin the geometry of the optimization landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ubcf5\uc18c \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uae09\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ub85c\uceec \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218 L\uc758 \uc804\uc5ed \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf5\uc18c \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec diverging asymptotic series\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uad6c\uc870 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548", "result": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc5ed\ud559\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ubc30 \ud568\uc218 Z(g)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\ud310\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\uc801 \ud568\uc218 \uac12\uacfc\uc758 \uc77c\ub300\uc77c \ub300\uc751\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\uc5ed \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub85c\uceec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc11c\ube0c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ub85c\uceec \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218 L\uc758 \uc804\uc5ed \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc11c\ube0c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc218\ub834\uacfc \ucd08\uae30\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\uc18c \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc1c\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uae09\uc218\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc804\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ud1b5\ucc30\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\ubc30 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud329\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc5bc \ubc1c\uc0b0 \uad50\ub780 \uc804\uac1c\uac00 Borel \ubcc0\ud658\uc758 \ud2b9\uc774\uc810\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacbd\uad00\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ube44\ud310\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218 \uac12\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc791\uc740 \uacb0\ud569 g\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc5ed\ud559\uc801 \ubd84\ubc30 \ud568\uc218 Z(g) = \u222b e^{-L(\u03b8)/g} d\u03b8\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uae09\uc218 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \ube44\ud310\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218 \uac12\uacfc \uc77c\ub300\uc77c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud558\ub294 Borel \ud3c9\uba74\uc758 \ud2b9\uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac12\uc740 \ub85c\uceec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc804\uc5ed\uc801\uc778 \uc548\ub0b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc11c\ube0c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0c8\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacbd\uad00\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc5d0 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

In response, machine learning-based approaches have\nrecently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods\nsuch as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many\nrecent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more\nadvanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical\nsuccess index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective\nduring extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,\nrendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a\nquadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the\nresulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential\n(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss\ndemonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast\nperformance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the\noperational model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac15\uc218 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc778 AT \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac15\uc218 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud398\ub110\ud2f0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c QUBO \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ud574\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec, \ucd5c\uc885\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AT \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c AT \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub294 Lipshitz \uc0c1\uc218, \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \uc81c\uac70 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 AT \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uac15\uc218 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac15\uc218 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc218\uce58 \uae30\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uae30\ud6c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uadfc \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub354 \ubc1c\uc804\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc131\uacf5 \uc9c0\uc218(CSI)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 CSI\uac00 \uac15\uc218\uac00 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc774\ud558\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uac04\uc758 \uac74\uc870 \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc801\uc808\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc81c\ud55c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud398\ub110\ud2f0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ube44\uc81c\ud55c \uc774\uc9c4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(QUBO) \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ud574\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uacfc QUBO \ud615\uc2dd\uc740 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uace0\uae09 \ud638\uc6b0(AT) \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c AT \uc190\uc2e4\uc740 Lipschitz \uc0c1\uc218, \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \uc81c\uac70 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4."}}

We conduct causal impact analysis\nusing interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying\ninterventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the\npredicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and\nsecond, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect\nthe effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)\nto identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor.

To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a\nholistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and\ndeployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data\nprocessing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data\nprocessing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning\nstrategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of\ninstruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism\nfor preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress\nnoisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model\ndeployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training\ndata, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which\ninvolves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database\nconstruction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy\nleakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM\nsignificantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.\nMoreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc911\uad6d \uc758\ub8cc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c DPF-CM \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc911\uad6d \uc758\ub8cc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ub825\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "DPF-CM\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc2dc \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub454 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uc778 \uc608\uc81c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc18c\uc74c \uc0d8\ud50c \uc5b5\uc81c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uae30\ubc18 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ub178\ucd9c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638 \ubca1\ud130 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, DPF-CM\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc911\uad6d \uc758\ub8cc LLM\uc774 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub610\ud55c, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 27% \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc911\uad6d \uc758\ub8cc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 (LLMs)\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uad6d \uc758\ub8cc LLMs \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc885\ud569 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 DPF-CM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

In\naddition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix\nto recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.\nFinally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to\nsolve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates\nsignificantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the\nability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential\nto cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub098\ub178\uad6c\uc870 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc870\uac74 \uae30\ubc18 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 CbLDM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uace0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub098\ub178\uc7ac\ub8cc\uc758 \uc131\uc9c8\uacfc \uad6c\uc870 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub098\ub178\uad6c\uc870 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub098\ub178\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 CbLDM \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc870\uac74\uc801 \uc0ac\uc804 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc0dd\uc131 \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "CbLDM\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CbLDM\uc740 \ub098\ub178\uad6c\uc870 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uc18d \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2c8\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac \ub098\ub178\uad6c\uc870 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub098\ub178\uc7ac\ub8cc\uc758 \uc131\uc9c8\uacfc \uad6c\uc870 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uae30\uc0ac\ub294 PDF\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub098\ub178\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uae30\uc0ac\ub294 \uc870\uac74 \uae30\ubc18 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 CbLDM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec, \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc0dd\uc131 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0ac\uc804\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud6c4\uc18d \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubcf8 \uae30\uc0ac\ub294 \uac70\ub9ac \ud589\ub82c \ub300\uc2e0 \ub77c\ud50c\ub77c\uc2dc\uc548 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub098\ub178\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf8 \uae30\uc0ac\ub294 CbLDM\uc744 \ub098\ub178\uad6c\uc870 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, CbLDM\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub098\ub178\uad6c\uc870 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 CbLDM\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We introduce a Minimal-Data\nParametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which\nestablishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while\nstrictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the\nresidual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained\nneural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This\ndirectly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural\noperators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained\nat a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any\nretraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative\nPDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence\niterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,\nMD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,\neliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework\nis architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation\nsolvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural\noperators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully\naccelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous\nparameter distributions.

Claims from those methods are myriad: from faster\nconvergence to removing reliance on certain hyperparameters. However, the\ndiverse experimental protocols used to validate these claims make direct\ncomparisons between methods challenging. This study presents a comprehensive\nevaluation of recent optimization techniques across standardized LLM\npretraining scenarios, systematically varying model size, batch size, and\ntraining duration.

The existing\nmethods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,\n``jumping jacks\"). However, such data is rarely available in existing\nmotion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion\ndescriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.\nFirst, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions\ncorresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text\ndatasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening\nand closing of legs\" for ``jumping jacks\"). These refined annotations are used\nto retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.\nSecond, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the\ndetailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional\ntext data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise\nhigh-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness\nknowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning\naccuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text\ndatasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,\nand BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average\nperformance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and

Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they\nsuffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated\nmolecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent\nquality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware\nmolecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable\natom number predictor.

However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,\nthe class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In\naddition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all\nhistorical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to\nrecognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,\nto enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage\nlimitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual\nlearning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised\nidentification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an\nunsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated\nto detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical\ndata, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a\ngenerator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new\ntask arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous\nlearnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the\nnewly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is\nvalidated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised\nclassification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show\nthat the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies\nwhile maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, microbiome engineering faces\nsignificant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in\nmicrobiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),\noptimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial\ncomposition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater\ntreatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel\nclustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference\nMigration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a\nclustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we\nemploy the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to\nsynthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a\nresult, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of\nthe microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be\napplied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes.

While existing approaches typically freeze the\nbackbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,\nthey still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based\noptimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for\nresource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a\nforward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a\nlightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,\nboth designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt\nembeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance\nMatrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution\nshifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,\ntask-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via\nnonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental\nupdates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that\nFoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to\nforward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining\nhigh knowledge retention across long task sequences.

On\nstandard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer\nperceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the\nlarge molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small\nscales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain\neventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales\nwith the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared\nwith untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity.

While steering approaches like\ngradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac\nsteering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended\nto flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as\ntilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,\nFeynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic\ntasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional\nspace, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We\nthen demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously\nunsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with\nthe correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different\nhandedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways\nconnecting reactants and products.

However,\nas a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns\nabout the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may\ninfringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.\nMost existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from\na specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In\nthis paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts\nmodel parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing\nunauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of\nthe attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two\npairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and\nValue-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output\nunchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other\nfinetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks\ndemonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over\n95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its\neffectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by\nMergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,\nfurther enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging.

Recent developments in interference-aware estimators\nsuch as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way\ninto the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these\nestimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology\nto bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning\nobjective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this\nframework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to\ndirectly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through\nsimulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms\ninterference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.\nFurthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric

When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems\noffer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human\nbehaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing\nof self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and\nbehaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture\ntime dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).\nWe introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively\nhandle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of\nlongitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress\nprediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models\ntrained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.\nThese findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when\nmodeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ubc0f

Since\nits inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal\nwith application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource\nallocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with\nthe problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to\ndeliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been\npublished in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic\nassumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this\nwork, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a\nclustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest\nsuitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine\ndistance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that\ndetects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate\nour methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over\nforty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the\ngood performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated\nmanner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the\npractical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,\nproviding firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering\nmethods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks\ntrained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of\nlocal explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more\ninsights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability\nof local predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778

Meanwhile,\nexclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including\ndistances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This\npaper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven\ncurriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed\nentropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory\npredictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from\nsimple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The\nmulti-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction\nalongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning\nrealistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through\ncomplementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in\naccordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with\nup to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum\nlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ube44\uacb0\uc815\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uacfc\uc81c \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae30\ubc18 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc84c\uc73c\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae30\ubc18 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uacfc\uc81c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 GEO-BLEU (0.354) \ubc0f DTW (26.15) \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828\ud588\uc744 \ub54c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 2.92\ubc30 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud734\ub300\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc774\ub3d9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc800\uc801\ud569\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub2e4\uc74c \uc704\uce58\ub9cc\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac70\ub9ac\uc640 \ubc29\ud5a5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uc815 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801 \uc774\ud558\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae30\ubc18 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uacfc\uc81c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae30\ubc18 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 Lempel-Ziv \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uac83\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uacfc\uc81c \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \ubcf4\uc870\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub3d9 \uac70\ub9ac \ubc0f \ubc29\ud5a5 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ubcd1\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc694 \uc704\uce58 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

For the bivariate categorical setup with\nDirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled\nsynthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ\ntwo simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or\nconditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal\ndiscovery.

Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)\nobjective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks\n(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential\ngenerative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy\nRL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an\noff-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB\nwithin the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies\nits relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an\nillustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods\nachieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was\npreviously reported.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, KL \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Sequential Generative Models\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c RL\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uac15\uc870\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Generative Flow Networks(GFlowNets) \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, RTB\uc640 KL \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c Trust-PCL \uac04\uc758 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "RTB\ub294 KL \uc815\uaddc\ud654 RL\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud48d\uacbd \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\uce58\ud654\ub418\uba70, \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KL \uc815\uaddc\ud654 RL \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubcf4\uace0\ub41c \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc774 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uac15\uc870\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 KL \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc790\uae30 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, Generative Flow Networks(GFlowNets) \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c Sequential Generative Models\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

While prior research has focused on individual\ntasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model\nrobustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses\nthese limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends\nestablished cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming\napplication, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load\nannotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX\nratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.\nState-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer\narchitectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities\nand application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain\ngeneralization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently\noutperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures\nshowing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models\ntrained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel\napplications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load\nestimation.

While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical\nmodeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as\ntest-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,\nwe make three main contributions.

As a result, these agents do not improve with more\nexperience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that\nimprove via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much\nlarger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this\nsetting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing\ncode for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient\nupdates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration\nactions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed\nasynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,\nusing only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A\nprogram that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.\nTo address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial\ncredit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early\n(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static\nlanguage model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the\nagent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as\nreward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that\nperforming gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with\nRL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with

Currently, manual inspection methods are the default\napproach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,\nstate-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and\nare less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access\nand poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal\narchitecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such\nas IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the\nvehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while\navoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple\nvariants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them\nagainst unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal\nmodel achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to\nother applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can\nintegrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous\nvehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ubc0f \uacf5\uc720 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub9c8\ubaa8 \ubc0f \uc190\uc0c1 \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uc5ec \ubc0f \uce74\uc170\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc740 \uc190\uc0c1(\ucc0c\uadf8\ub7ec\uc9d0, \uae01\ud798 \ub4f1)\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uac10\uc9c0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \ub2a6\uac8c \uac10\uc9c0\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "IMU \ubc0f \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc13c\uc11c\ub97c \ucc28\ub7c9\uc758 \uc55e \uc720\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc7a5\ucc29\ub41c \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud55c \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uac10\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud480\ub9c1 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 92%\uc758 ROC-AUC\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc758 \ucda9\ub3cc \uac10\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc13c\uc11c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucc28\ub7c9 \ubc0f \uacf5\uc720 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9c8\ubaa8 \ubc0f \uc190\uc0c1 \uac10\uc9c0\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc784\ub300 \ubc0f \uce74\uc170\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ub304\ud2b8, \uc2a4\ud06c\ub798\uce58, \uc5b8\ub354\ubc14\ub514 \ucda9\uaca9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc190\uc0c1\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ubb34\uc2dc\ub418\uac70\ub098 \ub108\ubb34 \ub2a6\uac8c \uac10\uc9c0\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc218\ub3d9 \uac80\uc0ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc778\uac04 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uacfc \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubc94\uc704 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b8\ub354\ubc14\ub514 \uc190\uc0c1\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub35c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We identify two main limitations\nrelated to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which\nwe formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns\ntypically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative\nsamples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This\npaper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL\nalgorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample\nefficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via\na modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for\npositive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to\nprevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay\n(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further\nimproving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,\nwhere it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative\nincrease), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring\nsubstantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with\n5-60x faster inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc571 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5c5\uacc4 \ud45c\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 SoLS\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 RL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\ud68c\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4 \uadf9\ubcf5.", "method": "SoLS \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uae0d\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SoLS\ub294 AndroidWorld \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\uc18c 17% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, 5-60\ubc30 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc790\ub791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SoLS\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc571 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ucc45 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ud68c\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 (RL)\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uc815 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc81c\ud55c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ub192\uc740 \ubc18\ud658\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uae0d\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ucc45 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ud574\ub97c \ub07c\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc571 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 RL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Milone", "Enzo Ferrante"], "title": "BM-CL: Bias Mitigation through the lens of Continual Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when\nmodels amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias\nmitigation techniques often lead to a {\\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby\nimproving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced\nperformance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation\nthrough Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the\nprinciples of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that\nmitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual\nlearning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,\nimproving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge\nthat benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as\nLearning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret\nbias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models\nto incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for\ndisadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.\nExperiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by\ndiverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates\nbiases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges\nthe fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for\ndeveloping machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubd88\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc99d\ud3ed\uc2dc\ud0ac \ub54c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc644\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ubd88\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 '\uc218\uc900 \ud558\ud5a5 \ud6a8\uacfc'\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc644\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 BM-CL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd88\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uac8c \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "method": "BM-CL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574, \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd88\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0 \uc720\uc775\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc78a\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 '\uc78a\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubc30\uc6b0\uae30' \ubc0f '\ud0c4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud1b5\ud569'\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc5bb\uc5b4 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc644\ud654\ub97c \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc6d0\ub798 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5 \ubd84\uc57c\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uba70 \uacf5\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd88\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc99d\ud3ed\uc2dc\ud0ac \ub54c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc644\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ubd88\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 '\uc218\uc900 \ud558\ud5a5 \ud6a8\uacfc'\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \ube44\ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc644\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc644\ud654\uac00 \uac1c\ub150\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc99d\uac00\ud615 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubd88\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc78a\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of\ntechnical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle\nwith adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a\nframework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers\nlower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,\ntransmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients\ndue to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM\ndistillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first\npropose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying\nlogits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the\ndimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design\nan adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial\nand uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.\nFinally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted\nhidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the\ncommunication overhead further while providing richer representation.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance\ncompared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead\nby approximately 50%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758

Accurate modeling of\nthese changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding\npreventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction\nof CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning\n(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,\nand predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target\nBayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to\njointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The\nmodel leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,\nembeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture\nbiomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data\nfrom 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of\nbaselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,\nRMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model\nuncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via\nits attention and embedding mechanisms.

However, their\nability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world\napplication domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first\nstep is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,\nwe introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as\ntime-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical\nrelevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33\nreal-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of\nchallenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with\nthreshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and\nmulti-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be\ndynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task\ntypes are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt\ntask-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure\nmeaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight\nstate-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals\nlimitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis\nworkflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for\ndomain-specific adaptation.

Existing\nvessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple\norigin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic\ngraphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big\nmaritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination\npairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to\nselect direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete\naction space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind\nresistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System\n(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields.

This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route\ntransit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve\naccessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first\nmake scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a\npre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns\nvehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand\nfluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal\nPolicy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based\nsimulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that\nafter efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with\ndynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized\ncosts on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency\ngain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.\nThis study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and\nmachine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork\nfor further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in\nmultimodal transit systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacf5\uc720 \uc790\uc728 \ucc28\ub7c9(SAV)\uacfc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uad6c\uc5ed \ubc30\ucc28 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\uc218\uc694\ud615 \ud658\uc2b9 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc800\ubc00\ub3c4 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc815 \ub178\uc120 \ub300\uc911\uad50\ud1b5\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc218\uc694 \ubc18\uc751\ud615 \uad50\ud1b5\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\ub7c9\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc218\uc694 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \uc138\ubd84\ub41c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uad6c\uc5ed\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6c4, \ubc18\uc218\uc694\ud615 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uace0\uc815 \ub178\uc120 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ubcf4\ub2e4 16% \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2b9\uac1d\uc744 13% \ub192\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc1a1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 SAV \ud658\uc2b9 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc640 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ub300\uc911\uad50\ud1b5\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc904 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\uc911\uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub9c8\uc77c-\ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ub9c8\uc77c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \ud601\uc2e0\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacf5\uc720 \uc790\uc728 \ucc28\ub7c9(SAV)\uacfc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uad6c\uc5ed \ubc30\ucc28 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\uc218\uc694\ud615 \ud658\uc2b9 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub294 \uc800\ubc00\ub3c4 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc815 \ub178\uc120 \ub300\uc911\uad50\ud1b5\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc218\uc694 \ubc18\uc751\ud615 \uad50\ud1b5\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc885\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 SAV\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uc608\uc815\ub41c \uace0\uc815 \uc815\ucc28\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c \ud6c4, \ubbf8\ub9ac \uacb0\uc815\ub41c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ub178\uc120 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\uc218\uc694\ud615 \uc2b9\ucc28 \ubc0f \ud558\ucc28 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2ec\uce35 RL \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc815\ucc45 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc218\uc694 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\ub7c9\uc744 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ub178\uc120 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \ub3c5\uc77c \ubb8c\ud5e8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc84\uc2a4 \ub178\uc120\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 RL \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6c4, \ub3d9\uc801 \uad6c\uc5ed \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ubc18\uc218\uc694\ud615 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uac00 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uace0\uc815 \ub178\uc120 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 13% \ub192\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c 16% \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2b9\uac1d\uc744 \uc218\uc1a1\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity\nmulti-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational\ncost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill\nsampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for\nfaster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel\ncontinuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell\nwithin a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search\ndimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS\nalgorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under\nlimited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow\nregression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The\nproposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model\nwith application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good\nprediction with less computational complexity.

This study proposes an\nattention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing\ndecision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep\nreinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes\nwithout requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method\nis developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based\nformulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the\nscarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy\noptimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities\nto handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two\nkey strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\\% in\nsolution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus\n100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong\ngeneralization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time\nconstraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter\ndistributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively\nbalances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly\nsuitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid\ndecision-making is essential for saving lives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc7ac\ud574 \ud6c4 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc190\uc0c1 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub4dc\ub860

Future order distribution information, which reflects the\ndistribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the\nperformance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize\nspatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution\ninformation from serious time slices. However, learning future order\ndistribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem\nwith strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture\nthis information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative\nspatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and\nglobal) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior\nperformance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The\nmain contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global\ngraphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional\nlong time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An\ninnovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph\nlearning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to\nextract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust\nfuture graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure\nforecasting outcomes.

The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety\nratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include\nactive safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).\nIt is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.\nThis study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision\nWarning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot\nDetection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,\nModel Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's\nlikelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a\npublicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately\n5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four\ndifferent machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient\nboosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified\ncross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest\nand gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.\nAnalysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,\nspecifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,\ncontributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.\nHowever, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive\ncontributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a\nheld-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This\nresearch reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data\nand highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle\nparameters and modern ADAS features

We\nposit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and\nhindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited\nor misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a\nsystematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales\n(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).\nWe find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter\ntuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,\nperformed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one\noptimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer\nunfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned\nbaselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for\n1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before\nreaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two\noptimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our\nthorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon\nand Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with\nmatrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based\noptimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over\nAdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.", "AI":

While $t^3$VAE improves robustness\nvia heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent\nvolume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this\nissue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.\nTo this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class\n\\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing\ndominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form\nobjective derived from the $\\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for\nclass-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of\nStudent's t-distributions.

Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,\noverlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory\nis encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations\nand quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this\nduality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by\npredictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the\nneocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on\nauto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic\ncapabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this\npaper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore\nits episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall\nthe specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small\nnumber of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not\ngeneralize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic\nlearning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall\ncapabilities.

However, there is a notable gap between the performance of\nmedical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world\nclinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams\nfail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework\nthat moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,\nhigh-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework\ncomprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic\nclinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical\nRubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation\nmetrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter\nmedical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement\nlearning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nalgorithm.

However, existing methods\nmay fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales\n(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In\nthis work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across\nmultiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we\nintroduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features\nat multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph\nModeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust\nhigh-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these\nfeatures through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively\ncapture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six\nreal-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of\n3.8\\% and 6.8\\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-Hyper\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ucc99\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ucc28\uc6d0 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 MTS \uc608\uce21 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ucc99\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ud53c\ub77c\ubbf8\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1(STPM) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1(AHM) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 ST-\ucc99\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0bc\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c MTS \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, ST-Hyper\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc7a5\uae30 \ubc0f \ub2e8\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac01\uac01 \ud3c9\uade0 MAE\ub97c 3.8% \ubc0f 6.8% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ST-Hyper\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucea1\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4(MTS) \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uacf5\uac04(\ubcc0\uc218 \uac04) \ub610\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04(\ubcc0\uc218 \ub0b4) \ucc99\ub3c4\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ucc99\ub3c4(ST-\ucc99\ub3c4, \uc989 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ud568\uaed8 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ucc99\ub3c4) \uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec ST-\ucc99\ub3c4 \uac04\uc758 \uace0\ucc28 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 ST-Hyper\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 ST-\ucc99\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ud53c\ub77c\ubbf8\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1(STPM) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uace0\ucc28 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud76c\uc18c \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1(AHM) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud2b9\uc9d5\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucc99\ub3c4 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0bc\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c MTS \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc ST-Hyper\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc7a5\uae30 \ubc0f \ub2e8\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac01\uac01 3.8% \ubc0f 6.8%\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 MAE \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, since posterior distributions are rarely\nevaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or\nsampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples\nfrom a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely\nused for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for\nthe discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle\nsampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and\nstochastic reflection to perform sampling.

Tensorial partial differential\nequations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such\nmultidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous\napproaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen\nhigh-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these\nTPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and\nheterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs\n(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for\nsecond-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages\nthe separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement\nefficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency\ninformation. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph\nperturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties.

We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked\nProbability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard\ndeviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.\nEvaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons\ndemonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved\ncoverage compared to strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "RDIT\ub294 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ucd94\uc815 \ubc0f \uc794\ucc28 \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud655\uc0b0\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, PTSF\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c PTSF\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "RDIT\ub77c\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ucd94\uc815 \ubc0f \uc794\ucc28 \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud655\uc0b0\uc744 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 Mamba \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "RDIT\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ub300\ube44 \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 CRPS, \ube60\ub978 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5ec\ub35f \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, RDIT\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc624\ucc28\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ud45c\uc900 \ud3b8\ucc28 \uc870\uc815\uc73c\ub85c CRPS\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21(PTSF)\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uace0\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub180\ub78d\uac8c\ub3c4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc624\ucc28\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud3c9\uade0\uc774 0\uc778 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc99d\uac15\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 PTSF\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ucd94\uc815\uacfc \uc794\ucc28 \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud655\uc0b0\uc744 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 Mamba \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RDIT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc21c\uc704 \ud655\ub960 \uc810\uc218(CRPS)\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud45c\uc900 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\ud3ec \ub9de\ucda4\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ud638\ub77c\uc774\uc98c\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc5ec\ub35f \uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, RDIT\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 CRPS, \ube60\ub978 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple\nyet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming\n(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may\nlead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key\nreason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that\nthe evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive\nunderstanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm\nwith dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high\nperformance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,\nwhich optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while\nminimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the\nproblem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear\nprogramming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical\nprogramming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our\nmethod can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the\ndimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering\ntheir overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential\nadvantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of\nsimulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nmanaged to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the\nmanually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP\nmethods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In\naddition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into\nthe design of more effective and interpretable ARs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c4\ud654\ub41c

Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a\nSpherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of\nERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\\sigma}-levels. The model\nincorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates\nprescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere\ndynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces\nclimatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,\nincluding surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2\nconcentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as\nequatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,\nwhile showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite\nrequiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,\ntraining in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,\nphysical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid\nexperimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate\ndynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and\nfuture Earth system emulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LUCIE-3D\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 3D \uae30\ud6c4 \uc5d0\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub85c, \ub300\uae30\uc758 \uc218\uc9c1 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc751\ud558\uba70 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uae30 \uc218\uc9c1 \uad6c\uc870 \ubc0f \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) \ubc31\ubcf8\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 30\ub144\uac04\uc758 ERA5 \uc7ac\ubd84\uc11d \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5.", "result": "LUCIE-3D\ub294 \uae30\ud6c4 \ud3c9\uade0, \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\uba70, CO2 \ub18d\ub3c4 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc9c0\ud45c \uc628\ub09c\ud654 \ubc0f \uc131\uce35\uad8c \ub0c9\uac01\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uae30\ud6c4 \uc5ed\ud559 \ud0d0\uad6c \ubc0f \uacfc\uac70 \uae30\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uae30\uc758 \uc218\uc9c1 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc751\ud558\uba70 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc138 \ucc28\uc6d0 \uae30\ud6c4 \uc5d0\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130 LUCIE-3D\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 LUCIE-2D \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec LUCIE-3D\ub294 \uad6c\ud615 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790(SFNO) \ubc31\ubcf8\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 8\uac1c\uc758 \uc218\uc9c1 {\u0003c3}-\uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 30\ub144\uac04\uc758 ERA5 \uc7ac\ubd84\uc11d \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac15\uc81c \ubcc0\uc218\ub85c\uc11c \ub300\uae30 CO2\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uaddc\uc815\ub41c \ud574\uc218\uba74 \uc628\ub3c4(SST)\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \ud574\uc591-\ub300\uae30 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 LUCIE-3D\uac00 \uc9c0\uad6c \uc628\ub09c\ud654 \ubc0f \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 CO2 \ub18d\ub3c4 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uce35\uad8c \ub0c9\uac01\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uae30\ud6c4 \ud3c9\uade0, \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ud604\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc801\ub3c4 \ucf08\ube48\ud30c, \ub9e4\ub4e0-\uc904\ub9ac\uc548 \uc624\uc2e4\ub808\uc774\uc158, \uace0\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

C", "Tingting Chen", "Dianbo Liu"], "title": "Data-Dependent Smoothing for Protein Discovery with Walk-Jump Sampling", "comment": null, "summary": "Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by\nlearning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate\nhigh-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other\ncomplex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse\nand unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,\nwe observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the\nmajority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing\napproaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we\nintroduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel\ndensity estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale\n$\\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these\ndata-dependent $\\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the\ndenoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of\nprotein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields\nconsistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of\ndata-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional\nsettings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ubb34\ub529 \uc6cc\ud06c-\uc810\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucee4\ub110 \ubc00\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815(KDE)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc98\ub9ac \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc758 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c $\u0003C3$\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 $\u0003C3$ \uac12\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc2a4\ucf54\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uadf8\ub9c8 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc5ed\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \uace0\ub974\uac8c \ud37c\uc838 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \uc790\uccb4\uac00 \uace0\ub974\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ubc00\uc9d1\ub41c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc5d0 \uc704\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub300\ub2e4\uc218 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uac04 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc744 \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc758 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c $\u0003C3$\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucee4\ub110 \ubc00\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815(KDE)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc98\ub9ac \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc758\uc874\uc801 \uc2a4\ubb34\ub529 \uc6cc\ud06c-\uc810\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 $\u0003C3$ \uac12\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ucf54\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ub514\ub178\uc774\uc9d5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uadf8\ub9c8 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world\ndatasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly\nfor rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable\nautomated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and\nefficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust\nadversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep\nabstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model\nto distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create\ndiverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.\nSubsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a\ncomputationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which\nstochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and\nrobustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public\nOSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly\noutperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work\nvalidates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient\nalternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced\nclassification tasks.

However, its optimization process is\ncomputationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we\ndevelop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to\nrealize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost.

This\nassumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but\ninherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could\nbe predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive\ninformation-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards\nthe assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the\npotential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based\non information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes\nGacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses\nthis information to learn task-relevant representations based on the\nInformation Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed\nto achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while\nsimultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common\nrepresentations, as well as among different unique representations.\nImportantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is\npredictively sufficient for the downstream task.

Current\napproaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high\ncomputational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when\nfine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot\nframework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'\nvision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for\ndirect similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by\nemploying structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.\nThe TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables\nreal-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior\ngeneralization across diverse environments.

Such a model can be used to predict the\neffects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect\nintrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of\nautomating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models\nhave been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves\nincreasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT\nsystems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,\ndata-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The\nmethod, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that\ncapture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using\nGaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected\nthrough a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is\noptimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.\nExperimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate\nidentification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with\nsystem operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c IT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "IT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uacf5\ud559 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 '\ub2a5\ub3d9 \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5'\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd88\ub9ac\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uce21\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ud68c\uadc0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc778\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "IT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uacf5\ud559 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\uace0, \uce68\uc785\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad00\ub9ac \uc791\uc5c5 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub77c\ub294 \uc624\ub79c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc2ec\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uace0 \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\ub300 IT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc774\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c IT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 '\ub2a5\ub3d9 \uc778\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5'\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ub974\ub294 \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3 \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uc785 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uce21\uc815\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ud68c\uadc0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uac80\uc99d\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc778\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a\nmachine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively\ntransforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This\ntwo-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions\nresult in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,\nproviding evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained\noptimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.\nSimulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to\n(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without\nthe need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature\nfor simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for\nsimulating predictions of multiclass classifiers.

Although the fundamentals of this technology were\nestablished decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key\nrole in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning\nalgorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing\ndomains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning\nmodels within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have\nfour main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code\nmodifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing\ncodes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for\ngradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually\ncompute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a\ngeneral, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code\nmodifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the\ntrade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within\na given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying\nit to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing\npatterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art\ngeneral AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any\ncode changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "DaCe AD\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \ubcc0\uacbd \uc5c6\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9 \ubbf8\ubd84\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uace0, \ucf54\ub4dc \uc218\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uacfc\ud559 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "DaCe AD\ub294 ILP \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc81c\uc57d \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc800\uc7a5\uacfc \uc7ac\uacc4\uc0b0 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "NPBench \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 JAX\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3c9\uade0 92\ubc30 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \ubcc0\uacbd \uc5c6\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9 \ubbf8\ubd84\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 DaCe AD\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\ub3d9 \ubbf8\ubd84(AD)\uc740 \uccb4\uc778 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac1c\uc785 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc220 \uc9d1\ud569\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\uc2ed \ub144 \uc804\uc5d0 \ud655\ub9bd\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc5ed\uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc7ac\uac01\uad11\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In\na world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we\nevaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible\noutcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given\nthe ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey\ndescribes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and\nmeasure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision\nmakers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint\nthat emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between\nthe world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature\nor the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures\nquantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain\nclasses of distinguishers or statistical measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \ud655\ub960\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uc608\uce21\uae30\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc608\uce21 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud574\uc11d\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc640 \uc608\uce21\uae30\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uce98\ub9ac\ube0c\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uce21\uc815\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub294 \ubc14\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uce98\ub9ac\ube0c\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc608\uce21\uae30\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \uad6c\ubcc4 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ubc14\ub77c\ubcf4\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uce98\ub9ac\ube0c\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uce21\uc815\uc774 \ub450 \uc138\uacc4\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ud2b9\uc815 \uad6c\ubcc4\uc790\ub098 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uce21\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9b0\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uce98\ub9ac\ube0c\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\ub150\uc73c\ub85c, \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud574\uc11d\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uad00\ucc30\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 (\uc774\uc0b0) \uacb0\uacfc\ub9cc \uc788\ub294 \uc138\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c, \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c (\uc5f0\uc18d\uc801) \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uae30\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud574\uc57c \ud560\uae4c? \uce98\ub9ac\ube0c\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ub110\ub9ac \ud37c\uc9c0\uba74\uc11c \ucd5c\uadfc \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc558\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc870\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uce98\ub9ac\ube0c\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uadfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uce21\uc815\uc774 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc758\ubbf8\uac00 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc740 \uc608\uce21\uae30\uac00 \uac00\uc815\ud55c \uc138\uacc4\uc640 \uc790\uc5f0\uc774\ub098 \ubca0\uc774\uc988 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uae30\uac00 \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \uad6c\ubcc4 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uce98\ub9ac\ube0c\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uce98\ub9ac\ube0c\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uce21\uc815\uc740 \ub450 \uc138\uacc4\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815 \uad6c\ubcc4\uc790\ub098 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uce21\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub290 \uc815\ub3c4 \uad6c\ubcc4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, this joint\nlearning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities\noverwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from\neach modality and the inter-modality interaction information. Existing\nstrategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient\nmodulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods\nremain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it\narises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This\nlimitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance\nlearning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective\ninteractions between modalities and better utilization of information from\nindividual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce\nUnidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the\nconventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.\nUDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned\nrepresentations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,\nthe dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to\nthe task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By\ndecoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI\nprevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal\nfeature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms\nexisting methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance\nimprovement in multimodal learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc778 Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uac15\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uac00 \uc57d\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc555\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "UDI\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc778\ud2b8 \ub85c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\uae30\ud558\uace0, \uba3c\uc800 \uc575\ucee4 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc218\ub834\ud560 \ub54c\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ud6c4, \ud574\ub2f9 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc190\uc2e4\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "UDI\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub354 \uc798 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70, \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "UDI\ub294 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc5b4\ub290 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uac00 \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc870\uc778\ud2b8 \ub85c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc870\uc778\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uac15\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uac00 \uc57d\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc555\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uc900\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc801 \uc190\uc2e4 \uac00\uc911\uce58, \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc804\ub7b5\ub4e4\uc740 \uc870\uc778\ud2b8 \uc190\uc2e4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc774\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \uc870\uc778\ud2b8 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc778\ud2b8 \ub85c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \ud559\uc2b5 \u0441\u0445\u0435\u043c\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc778 Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

In real-life (text)\nclassification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often\nunevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced\ndata. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced\nclassification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority\nclass to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose\noversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data\nposes a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of\ntext compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of\ntext increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow\nas well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The\ntransition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly\nfrom the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in\noversampling.

The Cumulative\nSpectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between\nclasses within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset\ncomplexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)\ncorrelates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,\nwe rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction\nbenchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters\ngoverning its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per\nclass, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary\nto the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice\nof K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,\nand (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance\nmetrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,\nWN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported\nstability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction\nsettings.

A key tool in understanding and improving such\nestimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how\ninformation about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and\ndetermines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is\nessential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant\ninformation internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher\ninformation through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it\nfrom the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance\ncorresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that\ntraining beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This\nprovides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the\nneed for a separate validation dataset.

One of the main challenges towards the successful\ndeployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions\nof parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been\nproposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated\nwhen producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently\nmanaging the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts\nshould be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.\n  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert\nmanagement optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture\nof LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first\npresent lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and\nrandomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like\npolicies have good theoretical competitive performance.

Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior\ninformation is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important\nrole because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a\nfew optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through\npreconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though\neffective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear\npreconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of\nrelying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with\ncomplex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,\nwhich induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide\nrange of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating\nfunction is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid\ndistance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed\nmethod, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To\nattain gradient norm less than $\\epsilon$, the convergence rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based\nmeta-learning methods.

Accounting for sharpness in the\nloss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten\ngeneralization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss\nprovoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although\ncritical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers\nfrom `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of\ngeneralization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters\nstabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers\na general approach to provably stabilize adversaries.

However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios\nusing Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and\nperformance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by\na distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation\nof low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing\ncatastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that\nstabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter\nout trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code\nblock nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the\npolicy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude\ngradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show\nthat SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math\nreasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only\nbaseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.\nFurthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR\nencourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning

Traditional data-driven approaches, such as\nconvolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological\ninformation about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate\ninformation exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning\nhydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction\nmodels collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training\nexplodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing\nmethods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying\nGNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,\nthus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for\naccurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every\nland and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow\ndirections and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a\nspatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the\nmost influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and\nacross five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),\nimproved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\\pm$5%) in hourly\ndischarge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal\nsparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution\nbasin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that\nscales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,\ndemonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines.

However, BAs face scalability challenges when\nhandling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are\nincreasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model\nchecking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data\nbecomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\\omega$-regular languages\nderived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\\omega$-word\nsequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize\nto out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas\ncorresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from\n3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target\n$\\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \\times$ longer\nthan training examples, with $92.6\\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or\nnear-perfect generalization.

Mixed Precision Quantization assigns\ndifferent precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer\nsensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post\nTraining Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each\nexpert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's\nsensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the\nactivation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach\nclusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory\nrequirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using\nState-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models\ndemonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive\naccuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to\nuniform-precision baseline methods.

We also demonstrate the\npractical effectiveness of our algorithms through simulation studies with deep\nlearning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucc44\ub110\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\uc0ac \ud558\uac15\ubc95 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c\uc801\uc778 \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucc44\ub110\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc804\uc1a1\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucc44\ub110\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ucc44\ub110 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc640 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\uc0ac \ud558\uac15\ubc95(SGD) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uace0, \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\uc0ac \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucc44\ub110\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uacf5\uc911\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc1a1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucc44\ub110 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ubc0f \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucc44\ub110\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\uc0ac \ud558\uac15\ubc95(SGD) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uace0, \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\uc0ac \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}
