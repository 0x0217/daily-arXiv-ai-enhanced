We\nhypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on\nthe same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot.

Existing large language\nmodel (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at\nevolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning\nrequired for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent\nLLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge\nto automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in\ntwo nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate\ncandidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites\nand queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that\ninjects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution\nsteers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient\nalgorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:\nspatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification\n(geospatial conformal prediction).

We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and\nclosed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and\nmolecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no\nsensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly\npermuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical\nmethods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently\noutperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided\nNearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with\nnearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves\ncompetitive or superior performance across domains without requiring\nsignificant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and\nclosed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice\nand highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based\nreasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, LLMNN\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uac1c \uc5f4\ub9b0 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc640 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc870\uc815\ub41c LLM\uc744 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uad50\ub780 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc790 \uc18d\uc131 \ubc1c\uacac \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud568.", "result": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uac1c\ubc29 \ubc0f \ud3d0\uc1c4 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub41c \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud655\ub960\uacfc \ubc30\uce58 \ud68d\ub4dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud5d8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uba85\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uad50\ub780 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc790 \uc18d\uc131 \ubc1c\uacac \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uac1c\ubc29 \ubc0f \ud3d0\uc1c4 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc870\uc815\ub41c LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uac00\uc124\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.

Where validators run affects resilience to\nregional shocks (outages, disasters, government intervention) and fairness in\nreward access. Yet in permissionless systems, locations cannot be mandated, but\nthey emerge from incentives. Today, Ethereum's validators cluster along the\nAtlantic (EU and U.S. East Coast), where latency is structurally favorable.\nThis raises a key question: when some regions already enjoy latency advantages,\nhow does protocol design shape validator incentives and the geography of\n(de)centralization? We develop a latency-calibrated agent-based model and\ncompare two Ethereum block-building paradigms: a Single-Source Paradigm (SSP),\nakin to MEV-Boost, where proposers fetch full blocks from a relay that also\npropagates them; and a Multi-Source Paradigm (MSP), where proposers aggregate\nvalue from multiple sources and broadcast the block themselves. Simulations\nshow that SSP concentrates around relay placement but more slowly, since\nproximity mainly affects propagation, and the marginal value of time is\nrelatively uniform across regions. MSP centralizes faster: aggregating across\nsources makes marginal value location-dependent, amplifying payoff dispersion\nand migration toward latency minima. Source placement and consensus settings\ncan dampen or intensify these effects, though once validators are already\nclustered, the impact of source placement on decentralization is marginal. In\nmost cases, North America consistently emerges as the focal hub.

Thus, we\npropose ViF, a lightweight, plug-and-play mitigation paradigm that relays\ninter-agent messages with Visual Flow powered by the selected visual relay\ntokens and applies attention reallocation to amplify this pattern. The\nexperiment results demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination\nsnowballing, consistently improving the performance across eight benchmarks\nbased on four common MAS structures and ten base models.

In such\ninteractions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well\ndo state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about\nphysical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of\ncoffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are\nthree-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical\nsafety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury\nnarratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety\nunderstanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic\nimages and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using\nadvanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of\nmajor foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger\ninterventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment\nreadiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a\npost-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about\nembodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.\nThe resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning\ninterpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in\nconstraint satisfaction evaluations.

These models make up for small training datasets by\npretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained\nvia pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model\nbecomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In\nthis work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to\ninduce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a\nminimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision\ntrees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning\nfrom data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional\nCART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not\noutperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable\nreasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the\nreasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:\ncorrecting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not\ncaptured in the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc801\uc740 \uc591\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc801\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc791\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc874 CART \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub610\ud55c, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \uc9c1\uad00\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud45c \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc778\uae30\ub97c \uc5bb\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5bb\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacb0\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uc548 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c, \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc740 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70 \uc870\uc791\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 LLM\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\uc790\uc6d0 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 CART\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \uc810\uac80\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc77d\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ubc18 LLM\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc601\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \uc9c1\uad00\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for\ninnovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost,\nand autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive,\nlabor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation\nsystems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or\npassive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated\nresponse.\n  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully\nautomated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM\norchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by\nLarge Language Models (LLMs).

This brittleness severely undermines their\nreliability and trustworthiness for real-world applications. To quantitatively\ndiagnose this instability, we propose metrics based on nodal and topological\nsimilarity to evaluate workflow consistency against common semantic variations\nsuch as paraphrasing and noise injection.

Existing\nbenchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in\nsystematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{UltraHorizon} a\nnovel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for\ncomplex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across\nthree distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are\ndesigned in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover\nhidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools\nmanagement, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale\nsetting, trajectories average \\textbf{200k+} tokens and \\textbf{400+} tool\ncalls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \\textbf{35k} tokens\nand involve more than \\textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive\nexperiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,\nwhereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap\nin agents' long-horizon abilities.

Elicitation of Personal Privacy Boundaries in AI-Delegated Information Sharing", "comment": null, "summary": "Aligning AI systems with human privacy preferences requires understanding\nindividuals' nuanced disclosure behaviors beyond general norms. Yet eliciting\nsuch boundaries remains challenging due to the context-dependent nature of\nprivacy decisions and the complex trade-offs involved. We present an AI-powered\nelicitation approach that probes individuals' privacy boundaries through a\ndiscriminative task. We conducted a between-subjects study that systematically\nvaried communication roles and delegation conditions, resulting in 1,681\nboundary specifications from 169 participants for 61 scenarios.

Decentralized reinforcement learning methods commonly encounter\ntwo substantial difficulties: first, they often yield self-centered behaviors\namong agents, resulting in frequent collisions, and second, their reliance on\ncomplex communication modules leads to prolonged training times, sometimes\nspanning weeks. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient\ndecentralized planning framework based on the Decision Transformer (DT),\nuniquely leveraging offline reinforcement learning to substantially reduce\ntraining durations from weeks to mere hours. Crucially, our approach\neffectively handles long-horizon credit assignment and significantly improves\nperformance in scenarios with sparse and delayed rewards. Furthermore, to\novercome adaptability limitations inherent in standard RL methods under dynamic\nenvironmental changes, we integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to\ndynamically guide agent policies.

However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize\nvisual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the\nreasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web\napplications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding\nbenchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and\nSafety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color\nrobustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed\nfrom 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step\ninference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.\nTo ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic\nevaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks\nwith targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The\nresults reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and\ncross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when\nfacing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout\nrearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in\nrecognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions.

In this paper, we propose strict,\nmathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a\nfundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the\nproperty that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the\nsystem is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or\nexceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal\ndefinitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI\nsystem: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are\neasily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we\nconsider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is\npossible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical\ninterpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,\nplanning, and graph reachability.

We focus on a simplified day-to-day route choice problem in a\nmulti-agent setting. We consider a city network where human drivers travel\nthrough their chosen routes to reach their destinations in minimum travel time.\nThen, we convert one-third of the population into AVs, which are RL agents\nemploying Deep Q-learning algorithm. We define a set of optimization targets,\nor as we call them behaviors, namely selfish, collaborative, competitive,\nsocial, altruistic, and malicious. We impose a selected behavior on AVs through\ntheir rewards. We run our simulations using our in-house developed RL framework\nPARCOUR. Our simulations reveal that AVs optimize their travel times by up to\n5\\%, with varying impacts on human drivers' travel times depending on the AV\nbehavior. In all cases where AVs adopt a self-serving behavior, they achieve\nshorter travel times than human drivers. Our findings highlight the complexity\ndifferences in learning tasks of each target behavior. We demonstrate that the\nmulti-agent RL setting is applicable for collective routing on traffic\nnetworks, though their impact on coexisting parties greatly varies with the\nbehaviors adopted.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\uc728\ucc28\uac00 \ud63c\ud569 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728\ucc28\uc640 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\ud63c\ud569 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\uc77c \uacbd\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589.", "result": "\uc790\uc728\ucc28\uac00 \ucd5c\ub300 5%\uc758 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uac04 \uc6b4\uc804\uc790\uc758 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \uc790\uc728\ucc28\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a8.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\ucc28\uac00 \uc790\uae30 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud560 \ub54c, \uc778\uac04 \uc6b4\uc804\uc790\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9e7\uc740 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\uc728\ucc28(AV)\uac00 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \uc77c\uc0c1 \uacbd\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04 \uc6b4\uc804\uc790\uac00 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc5ec\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa9\uc801\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub530\ub77c \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc778\uad6c\uc758 1/3\uc744 \uc2ec\uce35 Q-\ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 AV\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc774\uc775, \ud611\ub825, \uacbd\uc7c1, \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801, \uc774\ud0c0\uc801, \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ub4f1 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c(\ud589\ub3d9)\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 AV\uc5d0 \uc120\ud0dd\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uc0ac\uc758 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 PARCOUR\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc AV\ub294 \ucd5c\ub300 5%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba70 AV \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc778\uac04 \uc6b4\uc804\uc790\uc758 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a9\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite rapid advancements, current\napproaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in\nend-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of\ncontradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,\nAlignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative\nframework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip\nretrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a\nproactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)\nCheck module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the\nrisk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)\ncompletes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.\nCrucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on\ncomplex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization.

Facing\npotential system prompt leakage risks, model developers have implemented\nstrategies to prevent leakage, primarily by disabling LLMs from repeating their\ncontext when encountering known attack patterns. However, it remains vulnerable\nto new and unforeseen prompt-leaking techniques. In this paper, we first\nintroduce a simple yet effective prompt leaking attack to reveal such risks.\nOur attack is capable of extracting system prompts from various LLM-based\napplication, even from SOTA LLM models such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our\nfindings further inspire us to search for a fundamental solution to the\nproblems by having no system prompt in the context. To this end, we propose\nSysVec, a novel method that encodes system prompts as internal representation\nvectors rather than raw text. By doing so, SysVec minimizes the risk of\nunauthorized disclosure while preserving the LLM's core language capabilities.\nRemarkably, this approach not only enhances security but also improves the\nmodel's general instruction-following abilities. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SysVec effectively mitigates prompt leakage attacks, preserves\nthe LLM's functional integrity, and helps alleviate the forgetting issue in\nlong-context scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc720\ucd9c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, SysVec\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc720\ucd9c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604 \ubca1\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 SysVec\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SysVec\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, SysVec\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc720\ucd9c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc644\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9dd\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c LLM\uc774 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc720\ucd9c \ubc29\uc9c0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud574\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uc740 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc720\ucd9c \uae30\uc220\uc5d0\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc720\ucd9c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 GPT-4o\ub098 Claude 3.5 Sonnet\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uacb0\uad6d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc6d0\uc2dc \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604 \ubca1\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 SysVec\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 SysVec\ub294 \ud5c8\uac00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc720\ucd9c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud558\uac8c\ub3c4 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc900\uc218 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 SysVec\uac00 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc720\ucd9c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc644\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9dd\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc900\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to\ngeneralize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or\napplication databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based\nLLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these\nchallenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a\ngeneral-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The\nreasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents\nthen execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional\nobservations.

To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new\nregularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep\nNeural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships\nin complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,\nour method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear\nbaseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while\npreserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a\ncomprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,\nmeasures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements\ninto the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology\nusing a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically\ncreated dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show\nthat even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model\nperformance.

However, these tasks are often complex,\ninvolving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings\nto deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show\nsignificant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with\nheterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as\nverifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels\nfor such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,\na novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key\ncontributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and\nextracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a\nverification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the\nanalysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that\nstarts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the\nDS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified.

However, this task remains\nchallenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal\ncharacteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by\nexisting methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable\nspatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD\nprogression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model\nthe irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the\nOpen Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse\nregional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification\nof key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.\nNotably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal\nlobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral\nattention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities\ncorrelate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,\nour interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural\nsystems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the\nneurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight\nthe potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized\nprediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled\nlongitudinal imaging

Modern editors such as Cursor are designed not\njust for code completion, but also with more system privileges for complex\ncoding tasks (e.g., run commands in the terminal, access development\nenvironments, and interact with external systems). While this brings us closer\nto the \"fully automated programming\" dream, it also raises new security\nconcerns. In this study, we present the first empirical analysis of prompt\ninjection attacks targeting these high-privilege agentic AI coding editors. We\nshow how attackers can remotely exploit these systems by poisoning external\ndevelopment resources with malicious instructions, effectively hijacking AI\nagents to run malicious commands, turning \"your AI\" into \"attacker's shell\". To\nperform this analysis, we implement AIShellJack, an automated testing framework\nfor assessing prompt injection vulnerabilities in agentic AI coding editors.\nAIShellJack contains 314 unique attack payloads that cover 70 techniques from\nthe MITRE ATT&CK framework. Using AIShellJack, we conduct a large-scale\nevaluation on GitHub Copilot and Cursor, and our evaluation results show that\nattack success rates can reach as high as 84% for executing malicious commands.\nMoreover, these attacks are proven effective across a wide range of objectives,\nranging from initial access and system discovery to credential theft and data\nexfiltration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uace0\uad8c\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ucf54\ub529 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uae30\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc778\uc81d\uc158 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc2e4\uc99d \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ucf54\ub529 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uae30\uac00 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uc778\uae30\ub97c \ub04c\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AIShellJack\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc778\uc81d\uc158 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uba85\ub839\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 \ucd5c\uace0 84%\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ucd08\uae30 \uc811\uadfc, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uc790\uaca9 \uc99d\uba85 \ub3c4\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ucf54\ub529 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uae30\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 \ub354 \uc778\uae30\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite its benefits, existing studies rely\non hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and\nautonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic\nreinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,\ncapable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool\nresponses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step\nreasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by\ncaching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent\ntraining without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,\ninconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling\nsystem, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal\nfeasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level\nverifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,\nenabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply\naugmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically\nreplay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We\ndeploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct\ncomprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel\nenables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to

However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and\ndifficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a\nnon-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses\nduring cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers\nthat could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing\ndexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We\nrecruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test\n[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched\ncontrols. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their\ndominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the\nfifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data\n(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning\nframework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation\npatterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest\nNeighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity\ntasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we\nfound that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine\nlearning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus\n(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with\nsuppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During\nboth tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the\nconventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of\nfNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help\ndevelop personalized brain stimulation targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\ubc1c\uc131 \uacbd\ud654\uc99d(MS)\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc190\uc758 \uc7ac\uc8fc\uc640 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ud53c\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud638\uc18c\ud558\uba70, \ube44\uce68\uc2b5\uc801 \ub1cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uae30\uc220\uc778 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uadfc\uc801\uc678\uc120 \ubd84\uad11\ubc95(fNIRS)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \uc911 \ub1cc \ud65c\ub3d9 \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud588\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c MS \ud658\uc790\uc640 \ub300\uc870\uad70\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uac1c\uc778 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ub1cc \uc790\uadf9 \uce58\ub8cc\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\ubc1c\uc131 \uacbd\ud654\uc99d \ud658\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc190 \uc7ac\uc8fc \ubc0f \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ud53c\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc190\uc0c1\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc99d\uc0c1\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub1cc \ud65c\ub3d9 \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc190\uc758 \uc190\uc7ac\uc8fc\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 MS \ud658\uc790\uc640 \ub300\uc870\uad70\uc758 fNIRS \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "K-NN \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 75.0%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \ubcf5\ud569 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 66.7%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, MS \ud658\uc790 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc740 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc6b4\ub3d9 \ud53c\uc9c8 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b5\uc81c\ub41c \ub1cc \ud65c\ub3d9\uacfc \ub290\ub9b0 \uc2e0\uacbd\ud608\uad00 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "fNIRS \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac1c\uc778 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ub1cc \uc790\uadf9 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \ub1cc \ud65c\ub3d9 \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\ubc1c\uc131 \uacbd\ud654\uc99d(MS) \ud658\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc190\uc758 \uc7ac\uc8fc\uc640 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ud53c\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud638\uc18c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc190\uc0c1\uc740 \ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uadfc\uc801\uc678\uc120 \ubd84\uad11\ubc95(fNIRS)\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc6b4\ub3d9 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc911\uc5d0 \ub1cc\uc758 \ud608\ub958 \uc5ed\ud559\uc801 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uce68\uc2b5\uc801 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uae30\uc220\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc190\uc7ac\uc8fc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ud53c\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \ubcf4\uace0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub1cc \ud65c\ub3d9 \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ub1cc \uc790\uadf9 \uce58\ub8cc\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc190 \uc7ac\uc8fc \ubc0f \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uc560\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 15\uba85\uc758 MS \ud658\uc790\uc640 12\uba85\uc758 \uc5f0\ub839 \ubc0f \uc131\ubcc4\uc774 \ub9e4\uce6d\ub41c \ub300\uc870\uad70\uc744 \ubaa8\uc9d1\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub294 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc6b0\uc138\ud55c \uc190\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ubcf5\ud569 \uc791\uc5c5(\uac19\uc740 \uc190\uc758 \ub2e4\uc12f \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc190\uac00\ub77d\uacfc \uc18c\uadfc\uc721 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \uacf5\uc744 \uc7a1\uace0 \uc788\ub294 NHPT) \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc190 \uc7ac\uc8fc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 fNIRS \ub370\uc774\ud130(\uc0b0\uc18c\ud654 \ubc0f \ud0c8\uc0b0\uc18c\ud654 \ud5e4\ubaa8\uae00\ub85c\ube48 \uc218\uc900)\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc591\uce21 \uc804\ub450\uc5fd \ubc0f \uac10\uac01 \uc6b4\ub3d9 \ud53c\uc9c8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub1cc \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c MS \ud658\uc790\uc640 \ub300\uc870\uad70\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, due to LLMs' inherent uncertainty issues,\ngranting agents control over computers poses significant security risks. When\nagent actions deviate from user intentions, they can cause irreversible\nconsequences. Existing mitigation approaches, such as user confirmation and\nLLM-based dynamic action validation, still suffer from limitations in\nusability, security, and performance. To address these challenges, we propose\nCSAgent, a system-level, static policy-based access control framework for\ncomputer-use agents. To bridge the gap between static policy and dynamic\ncontext and user intent, CSAgent introduces intent- and context-aware policies,\nand provides an automated toolchain to assist developers in constructing and\nrefining them.

To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse\npreference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified\narchitecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent\nreward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition\nnetwork, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are\nfurther used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated\nlearning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In\naddition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to\nprovide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.\nEmpirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and\nSMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing\nbaselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward\nchallenges in online MARL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub4dc\ubb38 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub4dc\ubb38 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc5ed\uc120\ud638 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc628-\uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac00\uce58 \ubd84\ud574 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MAMuJoCo \ubc0f SMACv2\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 MARL\uc758 \ub4dc\ubb38 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uada4\ub3c4\uc758 \ub05d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub098\ub294 \ub4dc\ubb38 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud45c\uc900 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc5ed\uc120\ud638 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc628-\uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac00\uce58 \ubd84\ud574 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc0f \ub85c\uceec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc7a5\uc810 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ube44\ud310\uc790\uc640 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ud589\uc704\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc120\ud638 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.

To\naddress this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework\nthat decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration\nfor intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded\ncapabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled\narchitecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the\nsystematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective\nbehavior.

However, existing\ncollaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for\ndynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant\ncommunication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we\npropose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a\ncollaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the\nphysical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables\nagents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a\nsymbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates\nthrough LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential\nmiscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated\non challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World\nsignificantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task\ncompletion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline.

For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document\nquestion answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of\nretrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using\na fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K\ncontext window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on\nLongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length.

To\naddress this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build\nand deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)\nRISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction\ntrajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a\nmeticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802\nsingle-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for\nstandardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning\nframework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to\nenhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step\nLevel: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early\ntraining stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical\nlater steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to\nfocus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms\nexisting baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an\n8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success\nrate of 70.5% in online evaluation.

A\npromising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge\nand strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient\nexploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM\ninvocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.\nIn this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning\n(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned\naction pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,\nthe structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured\nfunction for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by\nutilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates\nforward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising\ndecision-making trajectories.

However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in\ncomplex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic\nreasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other\nadvanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,\nwhere an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,\nbut is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that\ncontain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively\ncollect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are\ngrade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5\nonly achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning\npatterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the\nenvironment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its\nnearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the\nability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern\nin static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.\nBased on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to\nimprove LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models\nto revisit.

This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized\ninfrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of\ncentralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to\ninformation aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial\nacceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication\nand memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as\nMetropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring\nservers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it\nfavors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of\nsubstantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,\nCIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,\ndemonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT\nfunctions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level\noptimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for\nwidespread integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "DYNAWEIGHT\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ud68d\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc624\ub298\ub0a0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uac15\ud654\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud6a8\uc728\ud654\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DYNAWEIGHT\ub294 \uc778\uc811 \uc11c\ubc84\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DYNAWEIGHT\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc11c\ubc84 \ub808\ubca8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ud638\ud658\ub418\ub294 \uc9d1\uacc4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \ub110\ub9ac \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ub298\ub0a0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc870\uce58\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc218 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc9d1\uacc4\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucc98\ub9ac\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 DYNAWEIGHT\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents\nindependently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often\nemerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the\nfuture reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic\nFollow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the\npast rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that\neven a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of\nregret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where\nthe prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We\nfurther capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time\ndelay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our\nWOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant\n($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge\nto the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in\npoly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and\nstrengthened by our experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc0c1\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "OFTRL(Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, WOFTRL(weighted OFTRL)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "WOFTRL\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub099\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc0c1\uc1c4\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\ubc18 \ud569 \uc815\uc0c1\ud615 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\uc218 \ub099\uc624\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0b4\uc26c \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ub418\uace0 \uac15\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubbf8\ub798 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc120\ub3c4 \uc900\uc218 \uc790(OFTRL)\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uacfc\uac70 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc740 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc2e4, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4 OFTRL\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud6c4\ud68c \ubc0f \uc218\ub834 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 OFTRL\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc74c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ubca1\ud130\uc5d0 $n$\ubc30 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ub450\ub294 \uac00\uc911\uce58 OFTRL(WOFTRL)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub099\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 \uc774 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc0c1\uc1c4\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc9c1\uad00\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub099\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \ub54c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 WOFTRL\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18 \ud569 \uc815\uc0c1\ud615 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c4\ud68c\uac00 \uc77c\uc815($O(1)$ \ud6c4\ud68c)\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\uba70, \ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ub0b4\uc26c \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ub418\uace0 \uac15\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

In this paper, we target the progressive\nexploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own\nexperiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway\ndivergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)\nrecipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a\nreplay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy\nupdate, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range\nof entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum\nto manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster\nskill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.\nAt first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the\naccumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar\ndistributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As\ntraining progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing\nsuccessful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level\nexploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.\nTo further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in\nthe replay buffer to address the potential policy drift.

Typical aggregation procedures, such as\nmajority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical\nimaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels\nsignificantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning\nevaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using\nprobabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can\nbe applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether\nmodeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic\nresponse models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form\nexpressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model\nscore.

This work addresses a distributed setting\nwhere agents maintain a local AM to recall their own associations as well as\nselective information from others. Specifically, we introduce a distributed\nonline gradient descent method that optimizes local AMs at different agents\nthrough communication over routing trees.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful\nsemantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal\nstatistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.\nTo address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the\nfull potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven\nsemantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary\nmismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language\ntokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the\nsemantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a\nsemantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a\nprogressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and\nan interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms\nexisting MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization\nin zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from\nnatural language instructions.

While existing\napproaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for\ndynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving\nauxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a\nneural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive\nperception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module\nthat abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning\nmodule that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and\n(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary\nlines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed\nloop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised\nfine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement\nlearning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic\nexploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a\nhigh-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or\naffine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that\nGeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and\nproblem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying\nhierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic\nverification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static\ninterpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new\nfoundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoSketch\ub294 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc9c0-\ucd94\ub860-\ud589\ub3d9 \ub8e8\ud504\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd-\uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\ud558\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0(GPS)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLMs)\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud574\uc11d\uacfc \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac01\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "GeoSketch\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub4c8, \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ucf00\uce58 \uc561\uc158 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub8e8\ud504\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GeoSketch\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c MLLM \uae30\ubc18\uc120\uacfc\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GeoSketch\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uacf5\uac04 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1a0\ub300\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\ud558\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0(GPS)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLMs)\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \ub3c4\ud574\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud574\uc11d\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac01\uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub3c4\ud574\ub97c \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf4\uc870\uc120 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc0f \uc544\ud540 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uce21\uba74\uc778 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc870\uc791 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd-\ucd94\ub860-\ud589\ub3d9 \ub8e8\ud504\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd-\uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GeoSketch\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We demonstrate\nits efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent\ntrajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with\nnon-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:\nweak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game\ndynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,\nwhich enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the\nconditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective\nconditioning operation for multi-agent domains.

However, developing these agents\nrequires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative\ntuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These\nhand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM\nagents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we\npropose \\textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that\ncan be applied to \\textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key\ninnovations: a generalized \"agent-as-a-tool\" mechanism that automatically\ndecomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit\nmechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent\nrouting function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent\nself-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on\nnew tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,\nInfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly\nimproving execution efficiency.

We identify a\ncritical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation\ncascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature\nconvergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,\nlow-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,\nwhere conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting\nchaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized\nPolicy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle\nthrough three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in\nmulti-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing\nregularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent\nabrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances\nexploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO\nguarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining\nconvergence.

Submitted to ICLR 2026", "summary": "As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to\nreal-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of\nagentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are\ncostly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that\ntranslate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we\npropose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual\ninformation between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended\nmethod for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of\nLanguage Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment\nfrom multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and\nscaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly\ncorrelates with average task performance, characterize the impact of\nenvironmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model\nscale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment\nstates and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.\nTogether, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose\nmetric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc911\uc2ec \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc18c\ubaa8\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "EELMA(\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uad8c\ud55c \ucd94\uc815) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uad8c\ud55c\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "EELMA\ub97c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uac15\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub4e4\uc740 \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc720\ub2a5\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ub113\uc5b4\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc911\uc2ec \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc124\uacc4 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0, \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc778\uac04 \ub514\uc790\uc774\ub108\uac00 \uace0\uc548\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc815\ubcf4\ub7c9\uc778 \uad8c\ud55c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c LM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uad8c\ud55c\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 EELMA(\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uad8c\ud55c \ucd94\uc815)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c EELMA\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uac15\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uba70, \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc5f0\uc1c4, \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uae38\uc774\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ucd94\uc815\ub41c \uad8c\ud55c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9c0\uc6e0\uace0, \ub192\uc740 \uad8c\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc21c\uac04\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub4e4\uc740 \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\ubc29\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, existing research has primarily\nfocused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how\naltruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges\nin large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a\nSchelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,\ncompelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between\negoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central\nfinding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We\nidentify two distinct archetypes: \"Adaptive Egoists\", which default to\nprioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly\nincrease under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and\n\"Altruistic Optimizers\", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,\nconsistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to\nthemselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings\nof these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to\nsystematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the\nfirst evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic\ntendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model\nselection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of\nchoosing an intrinsic social action logic. While \"Adaptive Egoists\" may offer a\nmore suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, \"Altruistic\nOptimizers\" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or\nscenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uacfc \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc774\ud0c0\uc8fc\uc758 \ubc0f \uc774\uae30\uc8fc\uc758\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 embody\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 Schelling \ubcc0\ud615 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc774\uc8fc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, 200\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\uae30\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc774\ud0c0\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, '\uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc774\uae30\uc8fc\uc758\uc790'\uc640 '\uc774\ud0c0\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc790'\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6c\ubcc4\ub418\ub294 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc0ac\ud68c \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \ucd5c\uc804\uc120\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc774 \uc2dc\ub3c4\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uae30 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ud0c0\uc8fc\uc758\uac00 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 Schelling \ubcc0\ud615 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc774\uc8fc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec 200\uba85 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\uae30\uc801(\uac1c\uc778 \ud6a8\uc6a9) \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc774\ud0c0\uc801(\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud6a8\uc6a9) \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ucc28\uc774\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 '\uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc774\uae30\uc8fc\uc758\uc790'\uc640 '\uc774\ud0c0\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc790'\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud0c0\uc785\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent deep learning\napproaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on\ngeneralization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these\nlimitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization\nproblem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that\nenforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method\nyields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than\ncompressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the\nsample complexity of learning heuristics.

While reinforcement learning serves as a\npowerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally\nface two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit\nassignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.\nSecond, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to\nevaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we\nintroduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process\nsupervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a\npolicy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve\non each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,\noutcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic\nprocess evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the\npolicy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously\nrefine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly\nlarger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines.

However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way\ncommunication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional\ncompress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose\nUniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that\nbridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or\nplain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the\ncommunication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while\nmaintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,\nlightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific\ndesigns-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token\nredundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided\ninpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC\nachieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low\nbitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These\nresults establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for\nnext-generation multimodal interactive communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniMIC\uc740 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud1a0\ud070 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c \ucf54\ub529 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uacfc \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc778\uac04-AI \ud611\uc5c5 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ucf54\ub371\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "method": "UniMIC\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ud53d\uc140\uc774\ub098 \uc77c\ubc18 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc555\ucd95\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\ud654\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub0ae\uc740 \ube44\ud2b8 \uc804\uc1a1\ub960\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec inter-token \uc911\ubcf5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "UniMIC\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc720\ub3c4 \uc778\ud398\uc778\ud305, \uc544\uc6c3\ud398\uc778\ud305, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc9c8\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ube44\ud2b8 \uc804\uc1a1\ub960 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ucd08\uc800 \ube44\ud2b8 \uc804\uc1a1\ub960(<0.05bpp)\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "UniMIC\ub294 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ub9bd\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378(LMM)\uacfc \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uacfc AI \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ubaa8\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ucf54\ub371\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \uc77c\ubc29\ud5a5 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc555\ucd95-\uc804\uc1a1-\uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc640 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud1a0\ud070 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c \ucf54\ub529 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 UniMIC\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.
