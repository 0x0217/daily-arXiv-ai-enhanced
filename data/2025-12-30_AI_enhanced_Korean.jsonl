By leveraging neural networks to learn complex Bloch functions and their associated eigenvalues (energies) simultaneously, we develop a mesh-free solver enforcing the governing Schr\u00f6dinger equation, Bloch periodicity, and normalization constraints through a composite loss function without supervision. The model is trained over the Brillouin zone to recover band structures and Bloch modes, with numerical validation against traditional plane-wave expansion methods. We further explore transfer learning techniques to adapt the solver from nearly-free electron potentials to strongly varying potentials, demonstrating its ability to capture changes in band structure topology. This work contributes to the growing field of physics-informed machine learning for quantum eigenproblems, providing insights into the interplay between symmetry, band structure, and neural architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 2\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc8fc\uae30\uc801 \ud3ec\ud150\uc15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c Floquet-Bloch \uace0\uc720\uac12 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud2b9\uc774\ud55c \ubc34\ub4dc \uc704\uc0c1\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud540\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc18c\uc7ac\uc758 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc8c\uc9d1 \uaca9\uc790 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube14\ub85c\ud750 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \uadf8\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uace0\uc720\uac12(\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0)\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc870\ud569 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc288\ub8b0\ub529\uac70 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd, \ube14\ub85c\ud750 \uc8fc\uae30\uc131 \ubc0f \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uba54\uc26c \uc5c6\ub294 \ud574\ubc95\uae30\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ube0c\ub9b4\ub8e8\uc559 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubc34\ub4dc \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ube14\ub85c\ud750 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uba74\ud30c \ud655\uc7a5 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uc218\uce58\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \uac70\uc758 \uc790\uc720 \uc804\uc790 \ud3ec\ud150\uc15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud558\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\ud150\uc15c\ub85c \ud574\ubc95\uae30\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ubc34\ub4dc \uad6c\uc870 \uc704\uc0c1 \ubcc0\ud654 \ud3ec\ucc29 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud540\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc7ac\ub8cc\uc640\uc758 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ubc0f \ub514\ub799\uc810\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ubc34\ub4dc \uc704\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubc8c\uc9d1 \uaca9\uc790 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4, 2\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc8fc\uae30\uc801 \ud3ec\ud150\uc15c\uc5d0 \uad00\ub828\ub41c Floquet-Bloch \uace0\uc720\uac12 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube14\ub85c\ud750 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \uadf8\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uace0\uc720\uac12(\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0)\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc870\ud569 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \uc288\ub8b0\ub529\uac70 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd, \ube14\ub85c\ud750 \uc8fc\uae30\uc131 \ubc0f \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uba54\uc26c \uc5c6\ub294 \ud574\ubc95\uae30\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ube0c\ub9b4\ub8e8\uc559 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \ubc34\ub4dc \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ube14\ub85c\ud750 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uba74\ud30c \ud655\uc7a5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uce58 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac70\uc758 \uc790\uc720 \uc804\uc790 \ud3ec\ud150\uc15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ud3ec\ud150\uc15c\ub85c \ud574\ubc95\uae30\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uba70, \ubc34\ub4dc \uad6c\uc870 \uc704\uc0c1 \ubcc0\ud654 \ud3ec\ucc29 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uace0\uc720 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uba70 \ub300\uce6d, \ubc34\ub4dc \uad6c\uc870 \ubc0f \uc2e0\uacbd \uad6c\uc870 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Motivated by this gap, this survey examines RL specifically through the lens of AoI and generalized freshness optimization. We organize AoI and its variants into native, function-based, and application-oriented families, providing a clearer view of how freshness should be modeled in B5G and 6G systems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a policy-centric taxonomy that reflects the decisions most relevant to freshness, consisting of update-control RL, medium-access RL, risk-sensitive RL, and multi-agent RL. This structure provides a coherent framework for understanding how learning can support sampling, scheduling, trajectory planning, medium access, and distributed coordination. We further synthesize recent progress in RL-driven freshness control and highlight open challenges related to delayed decision processes, stochastic variability, and cross-layer design. The goal is to establish a unified foundation for learning-based freshness optimization in next-generation wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ub098\uc774(AoI)\uc640 \uac15\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ub9ac\uc11c\uce58\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ub098\uc774\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ub098\uc774 \ubc0f \uadf8 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uace0\uc720, \uae30\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18, \uc751\uc6a9 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ucc45 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c RL \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815, \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131, \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucc28\uc138\ub300 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc138\uc6b0\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ub098\uc774(AoI)\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \ubb34\uc120 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \uce21\uc815 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc870\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 AoI \uacf5\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uac70\ub098 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ub17c\uc758\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac04\uadf9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5b4, \uc774 \uc870\uc0ac\ub294 AoI\uc640 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub77c\ub294 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c RL\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 AoI\uc640 \uadf8 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uace0\uc720, \uae30\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18, \uc751\uc6a9 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc758 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub85c \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uc5ec B5G \ubc0f 6G \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae30\ucd08 \uc704\uc5d0 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc81c\uc5b4 RL, \ub9e4\uccb4 \uc811\uadfc RL, \uc704\ud5d8 \ubbfc\uac10 RL \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 RL\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4\uc640 \uac00\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1, \uc77c\uc815 \uad00\ub9ac, \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d, \ub9e4\uccb4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc0f \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c RL \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc885\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815, \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \ubc0f \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uac1c\ubc29\ub41c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."}}

RLLaVA decouples RL algorithmic logic from model architecture and distributed execution, supporting researchers in implementing new RL algorithms with minimal code, and to plug in a broad family of RL methods and vision-language models (VLMs) while remaining agnostic to specific training and inference engines. RLLaVA makes resource-efficient training of 1B--7B models feasible on common GPUs; notably, 4B-scale models can be trained end-to-end with full-parameter updates on a single 24GB GPU. Experiments on multi-modal and agentic tasks demonstrate that RLLaVA has task extensibility, and the models trained with it consistently improve performance over base models, competitive with other specially engineered RL frameworks.

However, it has long faced challenges such as heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on examiners subjective experience, and a lack of a unified quantitative coding system.\n  Results: Quantitative experiments showed that the mean semantic similarity between Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) interpretations and human expert interpretations was approximately 0.75 (standard deviation about 0.05). In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.\n  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment. The proposed multi-agent framework, by dividing roles, decouples feature recognition from psychological inference and offers a new paradigm for digital mental-health services.\n  Keywords: House-Tree-Person test; multimodal large language model; multi-agent collaboration; cosine similarity; computational psychology; artificial intelligence", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\uc6b0\uc2a4-\ud2b8\ub9ac-\ud37c\uc2a8(House-Tree-Person, HTP) \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uace0\ucc30\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2ec\ub9ac \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud45c\uc900\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "HTP \uadf8\ub9ac\uae30 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud55c \ucc44\uc810 \uae30\uc900\uacfc \uc8fc\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc591\uc801 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 HTP \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud574\uc11d\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "MLLM \ud574\uc11d\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud574\uc11d \uac04\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc774 \uc57d 0.75\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ud5a5\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc774 0.85\ub85c \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900\ud654 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560 \ubd84\ub2f4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc30\uacbd: 1948\ub144 John Buck\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3c4\uc785\ub41c \ud558\uc6b0\uc2a4-\ud2b8\ub9ac-\ud37c\uc2a8(HTP) \ub4dc\ub85c\uc789 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ud22c\uc0ac \uae30\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc624\ub7ab\ub3d9\uc548 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ucc44\uc810 \uae30\uc900, \uac80\uc0ac\uc790\uc758 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131, \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc591\uc801 \ucf54\ub529 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc: \uc591\uc801 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM) \ud574\uc11d\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud574\uc11d \uac04\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc774 \uc57d 0.75(\ud45c\uc900 \ud3b8\ucc28 \uc57d 0.05)\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ud5a5\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc740 0.85\ub85c \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c8\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uacfc \uc624\uba85 \uc9c0\uc6b0\uae30 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud658\uac01\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ub192\uc740 \uc0dd\ud0dc\ud559\uc801 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uacfc \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc2ec\ub9ac \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\ub860: \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud22c\uc0ac \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900\ud654 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560 \ubd84\ub2f4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, current computational methods struggle to capture intricate sequence dependencies and effectively handle ambiguous, hard-to-classify samples. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Fusion, a novel two-stage deep learning framework integrating adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. Unlike traditional static feature concatenation, we construct a panoramic feature space using 10 distinct descriptors and introduce an Adaptive Gating Mechanism.This mechanism dynamically regulates the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Furthermore, to address data distribution challenges, we employ a contrastive learning strategy driven by Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) and BLOSUM62-based data augmentation, which significantly sharpens the model's decision boundaries. Experimental results on the benchmark Set 1 dataset demonstrate that AVP-Fusion achieves an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. In the second stage, leveraging transfer learning, the model enables precise subclass prediction for six viral families and eight specific viruses, even under limited sample sizes.

They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc138 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc18c\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc774\uc288 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc30d\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc774\uc288 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uace0 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ubcf4\uc870 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ub3d9\ub9f9\uacfc \uac08\ub4f1 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc774\uc288 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc30d\uc744 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9.", "result": "\ub3d9\ub9f9 +1\uacfc \uac08\ub4f1 -1\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc911\ub9bd 0\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\uc640 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0bc\ub4f1\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ubb38\uc81c \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc30d\uc740 \uc138 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc8fc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00 \ub610\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uac00 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae0d\uc815\uc801, \ubd80\uc815\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc911\ub9bd\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\uc870 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ub3d9\ub9f9, \uac08\ub4f1 \ubc0f \uc911\ub9bd \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud568\uc218\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc815\ubc18\ub300\uc758 \uce21\uba74\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec, \ubb38\uc81c \ub610\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \ud574\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uc57c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \ud2b9\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c \uc9d1\ud569\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud560 \ub54c, \ud45c\uc900 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubcf4\uc870 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \ucde8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub3d9\ub9f9 +1\uacfc \uac08\ub4f1 -1 \uad00\uacc4\uc758 \uc30d\uc740 \ub450 \uc30d\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud0dc\ub3c4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc911\ub9bd 0 \uad00\uacc4\uc758 \uc30d\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc18\ub300 \uce21\uba74\uc744 \ub3d9\ub9f9\uacfc \uac08\ub4f1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc30d\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ubb38\uc81c \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc30d\uc744 \uc0bc\ub4f1\ubd84\ud558\uace0 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uadf8 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\ub9f9 \uc9d1\ud569\uacfc \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\ub840\uac00 \uc81c\uacf5\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, collecting comprehensive research datasets often demands manually reviewing many web pages to identify and record relevant data points, which is labor-intensive and susceptible to error. While the emergence of large language models (LLM)-powered web agents has begun to automate parts of this process, they often struggle to ensure the validity of the data they collect. Indeed, these agents exhibit several recurring failure modes - including hallucinating or omitting values, misinterpreting page semantics, and failing to detect invalid information - which are subtle and difficult to detect and correct manually. To address this, we introduce the AI Committee, a novel model-agnostic multi-agent system that automates the process of validating and remediating web-sourced datasets. Each agent is specialized in a distinct task in the data quality assurance pipeline, from source scrutiny and fact-checking to data remediation and integrity validation. The AI Committee leverages various LLM capabilities - including in-context learning for dataset adaptation, chain-of-thought reasoning for complex semantic validation, and a self-correction loop for data remediation - all without task-specific training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by applying it to three real-world datasets, showing that it generalizes across LLMs and significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving data completeness up to 78.7% and precision up to 100%. We additionally conduct an ablation study demonstrating the contribution of each agent to the Committee's performance.

To address this, we introduce Reflection-Driven Control, a standardized and pluggable control module that can be seamlessly integrated into general agent architectures. Reflection-Driven Control elevates \"self-reflection\" from a post hoc patch into an explicit step in the agent's own reasoning process: during generation, the agent continuously runs an internal reflection loop that monitors and evaluates its own decision path. When potential risks are detected, the system retrieves relevant repair examples and secure coding guidelines from an evolving reflective memory, injecting these evidence-based constraints directly into subsequent reasoning steps. We instantiate Reflection-Driven Control in the setting of secure code generation and systematically evaluate it across eight classes of security-critical programming tasks. Empirical results show that Reflection-Driven Control substantially improves the security and policy compliance of generated code while largely preserving functional correctness, with minimal runtime and token overhead. Taken together, these findings indicate that Reflection-Driven Control is a practical path toward trustworthy AI coding agents: it enables designs that are simultaneously autonomous, safer by construction, and auditable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Reflection-Driven Control\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c, \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubc18\uc131 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Reflection-Driven Control\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uac00\ub2a5 \ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c '\uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc131'\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub04c\uc5b4\uc62c\ub9b0\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815 \uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uacb0\uc815 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubc18\uc131 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac80\uc99d \uacb0\uacfc, Reflection-Driven Control\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uacfc \ud1a0\ud070 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 Reflection-Driven Control\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \ucf54\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\uc784\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uba70 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub180\ub78d\ub3c4\ub85d \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70 \uc2ec\uc9c0\uc5b4 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\ub97c \ub07c\uce58\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Reflection-Driven Control\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7fd\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, it poses a big challenge to replicate this learning process for autonomous agents, due to the complexity of visual input, the absence of action or reward signals, and the limitations of interaction steps. In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised, and sample-efficient framework to achieve imitation learning from videos (ILV), named Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR). BCV-LR extracts action-related latent features from high-dimensional video inputs through self-supervised tasks, and then leverages a dynamics-based unsupervised objective to predict latent actions between consecutive frames. The pre-trained latent actions are fine-tuned and efficiently aligned to the real action space online (with collected interactions) for policy behavior cloning. The cloned policy in turn enriches the agent experience for further latent action finetuning, resulting in an iterative policy improvement that is highly sample-efficient.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on a set of challenging visual tasks, including both discrete control and continuous control. BCV-LR enables effective (even expert-level on some tasks) policy performance with only a few interactions, surpassing state-of-the-art ILV baselines and reinforcement learning methods (provided with environmental rewards) in terms of sample efficiency across 24/28 tasks.

Specifically, the formulation of feasible strategies, as an essential component of conflict resolution and mitigation, has received insufficient scholarly attention. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate feasible strategies from two perspectives of consistency and non-consistency. Particularly, we begin with computing the overall rating of a clique of agents based on positive and negative similarity degrees. Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, $L$-order feasible strategies, and the corresponding optimal ones. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed models, we apply them to two commonly used case studies on NBA labor negotiations and development plans for Gansu Province and conduct a sensitivity analysis on parameters and a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art conflict analysis approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that our conflict resolution models outperform the conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures to enable the systematic identification of not only feasible strategies but also optimal solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc138 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0

Our central goal is to reliably transform heterogeneous article content into a unified, machine-readable representation. PERELMAN first elicits domain knowledge-including target variables, inclusion criteria, units, and normalization rules-through a structured dialogue with a subject-matter expert. This domain knowledge is then reused across multiple stages of the pipeline and guides coordinated agents in extracting evidence from narrative text, tables, and figures, enabling consistent aggregation across studies. In order to assess reproducibility and validate our implementation, we evaluate the system on the task of reproducing the meta-analysis of layered Li-ion cathode properties (NMC811 material).

Traditional defense mechanisms, which operate on static rules or shallow content filters, struggle to identify these conversational threats, especially when attackers use multimedia obfuscation and context-aware dialogue.\n  In this work, we ask a provocative question inspired by the classic Imitation Game: Can machines convincingly pose as human victims to turn deception against cybercriminals? We present LURE (LLM-based User Response Engagement), the first system to deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) as active agents, not as passive classifiers, embedded within adversarial chat environments.\n  LURE combines automated discovery, adversarial interaction, and OCR-based analysis of image-embedded payment data. Applied to the setting of illicit video chat scams on Telegram, our system engaged 53 actors across 98 groups. In over 56 percent of interactions, the LLM maintained multi-round conversations without being noticed as a bot, effectively \"winning\" the imitation game.

In this work, we introduce \\emph{Dictionary-Transform Generative Adversarial Networks} (DT-GAN), a fully model-based adversarial framework in which the generator is a sparse synthesis dictionary and the discriminator is an analysis transform acting as an energy model. By restricting both players to linear operators with explicit constraints, DT-GAN departs fundamentally from neural GAN architectures and admits rigorous theoretical analysis.\n  We show that the DT-GAN adversarial game is well posed and admits at least one Nash equilibrium. Under a sparse generative model, equilibrium solutions are provably identifiable up to standard permutation and sign ambiguities and exhibit a precise geometric alignment between synthesis and analysis operators. We further establish finite-sample stability and consistency of empirical equilibria, demonstrating that DT-GAN training converges reliably under standard sampling assumptions and remains robust in heavy-tailed regimes.\n  Experiments on mixture-structured synthetic data validate the theoretical predictions, showing that DT-GAN consistently recovers underlying structure and exhibits stable behavior under identical optimization budgets where a standard GAN degrades.

Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are often limited to coarse-grained visual analysis and lack the capacity for sophisticated reasoning. Moreover, they typically treat detection, grounding, and explanation as discrete sub-tasks, overlooking their intrinsic relationships for holistic performance enhancement. To address these challenges, we introduce LogicLens, a unified framework for Visual-Textual Co-reasoning that reformulates these objectives into a joint task. The deep reasoning of LogicLens is powered by our novel Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism, which iteratively cross-validates visual cues against textual logic. To ensure robust alignment across all tasks, we further propose a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. Complementing this framework, we first designed the PR$^2$ (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) pipeline, a hierarchical and iterative multi-agent system that generates high-quality, cognitively-aligned annotations. Then, we constructed RealText, a diverse dataset comprising 5,397 images with fine-grained annotations, including textual explanations, pixel-level segmentation, and authenticity labels for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogicLens across multiple benchmarks. In a zero-shot evaluation on T-IC13, it surpasses the specialized framework by 41.4% and GPT-4o by 23.4% in macro-average F1 score. Moreover, on the challenging dense-text T-SROIE dataset, it establishes a significant lead over other MLLM-based methods in mF1, CSS, and the macro-average F1.

Traditional quantitative methods remain vulnerable to survivorship bias, while many AI-driven approaches struggle with signal integration, reproducibility, and computational efficiency. We introduce MASFIN, a modular multi-agent framework that integrates LLMs with structured financial metrics and unstructured news, while embedding explicit bias-mitigation protocols. The system leverages GPT-4.1-nano for reproducability and cost-efficient inference and generates weekly portfolios of 15-30 equities with allocation weights optimized for short-term performance. In an eight-week evaluation, MASFIN delivered a 7.33% cumulative return, outperforming the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Dow Jones benchmarks in six of eight weeks, albeit with higher volatility. These findings demonstrate the promise of bias-aware, generative AI frameworks for financial forecasting and highlight opportunities for modular multi-agent design to advance practical, transparent, and reproducible approaches in quantitative finance.", "AI": {"tldr": "MASFIN\uc740 LLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uae08\uc735 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uae30 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae08\uc735 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "LLM\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uae08\uc735 \uc9c0\ud45c \ubc0f \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub274\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc644\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MASFIN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MASFIN\uc740 8\uc8fc \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, \ub2e4\uc6b0\uc9c0\uc218 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 7.33% \ub204\uc801 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc778\uc2dd \uc0dd\uc131 AI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uae08\uc735 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uae08\uc735\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uba70 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801 \ubd84\uc57c\ub97c \ubcc0\ud615\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae08\uc735\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc0dd\uc874 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70, \ub9ce\uc740 AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638 \ud1b5\ud569, \uc7ac\ud604\uc131 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uae08\uc735 \uc9c0\ud45c \ubc0f \ube44\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub274\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc644\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MASFIN\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud574 GPT-4.1-nano\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uae30 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ud560\ub2f9 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 15-30\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc8fc\uac04 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. 8\uc8fc \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c MASFIN\uc740 7.33%\uc758 \ub204\uc801 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, 8\uc8fc \uc911 6\uc8fc\uc5d0\uc11c S&P 500, NASDAQ-100 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc6b0 \uc9c0\uc218 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud588\uc73c\ub098, \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc740 \ub354 \ub192\uc558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc778\uc2dd \uc0dd\uc131 AI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uae08\uc735 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uae08\uc735\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uba70 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Despite their effectiveness, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that introduce carefully crafted feature-level perturbations to evade detection while preserving malicious functionality. In this paper, we present LAMLAD, a novel adversarial attack framework that exploits the generative and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to bypass ML-based Android malware classifiers. LAMLAD employs a dual-agent architecture composed of an LLM manipulator, which generates realistic and functionality-preserving feature perturbations, and an LLM analyzer, which guides the perturbation process toward successful evasion. To improve efficiency and contextual awareness, LAMLAD integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into the LLM pipeline. Focusing on Drebin-style feature representations, LAMLAD enables stealthy and high-confidence attacks against widely deployed Android malware detection systems. We evaluate LAMLAD against three representative ML-based Android malware detectors and compare its performance with two state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods. Experimental results demonstrate that LAMLAD achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of up to 97%, requiring on average only three attempts per adversarial sample, highlighting its effectiveness, efficiency, and adaptability in practical adversarial settings.

Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller \"compressor\" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger \"predictor\" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\\times$ more accurate, $4.6\\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\\%$ of API costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Through our strategic partnership with NVIDIA, we leveraged the NeMo Framework for LLM model fine-tuning to enhance agent performance. Specifically, we optimized the Search and Discovery agent by replacing our base model with a fine-tuned Nemotron small language model (SLM).\n  We conducted comprehensive experiments using the llama3.1-nemotron-nano-8B-v1 architecture, training LoRA-based models through systematic hyperparameter sweeps across learning rates, optimizers (Adam, AdamW), cosine annealing schedules, and LoRA ranks. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of NVIDIA's NeMo Framework to commerce-specific agent optimization, (2) LLM powered fine-tuning strategy for retrieval-focused commerce tasks, (3) demonstration of significant improvements in latency and cost while maintaining agent quality, and (4) a scalable framework for multi-agent system optimization in production e-commerce environments. Our results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Nemotron SLM effectively resolves the key performance issue in the retrieval component, which represents over 50\\% of total agent response time, while maintaining or enhancing overall system performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "PayPal\uc758 Commerce Agent \uac1c\ubc1c \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "PayPal \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uac70\ub798\ub97c \ud601\uc2e0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, NEMO-4-PAYPAL\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "NeMo Framework\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 LLM \ubaa8\ub378 \uc138\ubc00 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, Nemotron \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c Search and Discovery \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "llama3.1-nemotron-nano-8B-v1 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc885\ud569 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uba70, LoRA \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960, \uc635\ud2f0\ub9c8\uc774\uc800 \ubc0f LoRA \ub7ad\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc138\uc2ec\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ub41c Nemotron SLM\uc774 \uac80\uc0c9 \ucef4\ud3ec\ub10c\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc804\uccb4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 PayPal \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uac70\ub798\uc5d0 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc624\uae30 \uc704\ud574 NEMO-4-PAYPAL\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 PayPal\uc758 Commerce Agent \uac1c\ubc1c \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Although generative AI offers promise, current models often function as passive assistants rather than as autonomous executors. Here, we introduce OrchestRA, a human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform that unifies biology, chemistry, and pharmacology into an autonomous discovery engine. Unlike static code generators, our agents actively execute simulations and reason the results to drive iterative optimization. Governed by an Orchestrator, a Biologist Agent leverages deep reasoning over a massive knowledge graph (>10 million associations) to pinpoint high-confidence targets; a Chemist Agent autonomously detects structural pockets for de novo design or drug repositioning; and a Pharmacologist Agent evaluates candidates via rigorous physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations. This architecture establishes a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization. By seamlessly integrating autonomous execution with human guidance, OrchestRA democratizes therapeutic design, transforming drug discovery from a stochastic search to a programmable evidence-based engineering discipline.", "AI": {"tldr": "OrchestRA\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559, \ud654\ud559, \uc57d\ub9ac\ud559\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728 \ubc1c\uacac \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc744

Fuzzing has emerged as a scalable solution for discovering such flaws. Yet, existing hardware fuzzers suffer from limited semantic awareness, inefficient test refinement, and high computational overhead due to reliance on slow device simulation.\n  In this paper, we present GoldenFuzz, a novel two-stage hardware fuzzing framework that partially decouples test case refinement from coverage and vulnerability exploration. GoldenFuzz leverages a fast, ISA-compliant Golden Reference Model (GRM) as a ``digital twin'' of the Device Under Test (DUT). It fuzzes the GRM first, enabling rapid, low-cost test case refinement, accelerating deep architectural exploration and vulnerability discovery on DUT. During the fuzzing pipeline, GoldenFuzz iteratively constructs test cases by concatenating carefully chosen instruction blocks that balance the subtle inter- and intra-instructions quality. A feedback-driven mechanism leveraging insights from both high- and low-coverage samples further enhances GoldenFuzz's capability in hardware state exploration. Our evaluation of three RISC-V processors, RocketChip, BOOM, and CVA6, demonstrates that GoldenFuzz significantly outperforms existing fuzzers in achieving the highest coverage with minimal test case length and computational overhead. GoldenFuzz uncovers all known vulnerabilities and discovers five new ones, four of which are classified as highly severe with CVSS v3 severity scores exceeding seven out of ten. It also identifies two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the commercial BA51-H core extension.", "AI": {"tldr": "GoldenFuzz\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4 \uc815\uc81c\uc640 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc0ac\ub97c \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud37c\uc9d5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, RISC-V \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ud37c\uc800\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\ub3c4 \ubc1c\uacac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubc84\uadf8\uc640 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "GoldenFuzz\ub294 \ube60\ub978 ISA \uc900\uc218 \uace8\ub4e0 \ub808\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378(GRM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ub0b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4 \uc815\uc81c\uc640 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ud0d0\uc0ac\ub97c \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud37c\uc9d5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 RISC-V \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c, RocketChip, BOOM, CVA6\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, GoldenFuzz\uac00 \uae30\uc874 \ud37c\uc800\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc18c\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4 \uae38\uc774\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GoldenFuzz\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, CVSS v3 \uc2ec\uac01\ub3c4 \uc810\uc218\uac00 10\uc810 \uc911 7\uc810\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ucd1d \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc804\uc6a9 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc218\uc694\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc84\uadf8\uc640 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud37c\uc9d5\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud37c\uc800\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc778\uc2dd, \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\uc81c, \ub290\ub9b0 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4 \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\uc640 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud37c\uc9d5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GoldenFuzz\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

The bounds apply to elementary functions, including multivariate polynomials, the exponential function, and the reciprocal function, and are obtained using feedforward neural networks with the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation.

Existing multimodal models often produce hallucinations or inconsistent chains of thought, limiting clinical trust. We propose a diagnostic framework built upon LLaVA that combines vision-language alignment with logic-regularized reasoning. The system includes an input encoder for text and images, a projection module for cross-modal alignment, a reasoning controller that decomposes diagnostic tasks into steps, and a logic tree generator that assembles stepwise premises into verifiable conclusions. Evaluations on MedXpertQA and other benchmarks show that our method improves diagnostic accuracy and yields more interpretable reasoning traces on multimodal tasks, while remaining competitive on text-only settings.

Prior work primarily focuses on either the online setting where an agent learns about the unknown environment through iterative interactions, or the offline setting where a policy is learned solely from logged data. However, each of these paradigms has inherent limitations: online algorithms suffer from high interaction costs and slow adaptation, while offline methods are constrained by dataset quality and lack of exploration capabilities. To address these complementary weaknesses, we propose hybrid CMAB-T, a new framework that integrates offline data with online interaction in a principled manner. Our proposed hybrid CUCB algorithm leverages offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to mitigate the insufficient coverage or distributional bias of the offline dataset. We provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's regret, demonstrating that hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available, and effectively corrects the bias inherent in offline-only methods when the data is limited or misaligned. Empirical results further demonstrate the consistent advantage of our algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640

Accepted to AAAI 2026", "summary": "In this paper, we propose AMS-IO-Agent, a domain-specialized LLM-based agent for structure-aware input/output (I/O) subsystem generation in analog and mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs). The central contribution of this work is a framework that connects natural language design intent with industrial-level AMS IC design deliverables. AMS-IO-Agent integrates two key capabilities: (1) a structured domain knowledge base that captures reusable constraints and design conventions; (2) design intent structuring, which converts ambiguous user intent into verifiable logic steps using JSON and Python as intermediate formats. We further introduce AMS-IO-Bench, a benchmark for wirebond-packaged AMS I/O ring automation. On this benchmark, AMS-IO-Agent achieves over 70\\% DRC+LVS pass rate and reduces design turnaround time from hours to minutes, outperforming the baseline LLM. Furthermore, an agent-generated I/O ring was fabricated and validated in a 28 nm CMOS tape-out, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of the approach in real AMS IC design flows. To our knowledge, this is the first reported human-agent collaborative AMS IC design in which an LLM-based agent completes a nontrivial subtask with outputs directly used in silicon.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMS-IO-Agent\ub294 \uc544\ub0a0\ub85c\uadf8 \ubc0f \ud63c\ud569 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc9d1\uc801 \ud68c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900\uc758 AMS IC \uc124\uacc4 \uacb0\uacfc\ubb3c\uacfc \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AMS IC \uc124\uacc4 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \uacb0\uacfc\ubb3c \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0 \uace0\ub9ac \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uacfc JSON \ubc0f Python\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc124\uacc4 \uc758\ub3c4 \uad6c\uc870\ud654 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud654.", "result": "70% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 DRC+LVS \ud569\uaca9\ub960\uacfc \uc124\uacc4 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uba87 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uba87 \ubd84\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 LLM\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc.", "conclusion": "28nm CMOS \ud14c\uc774\ud504 \uc544\uc6c3\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c AMS IC \uc124\uacc4 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uac04-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825 \uc0ac\ub840\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc544\ub0a0\ub85c\uadf8 \ubc0f \ud63c\ud569 \uc2e0\ud638(AMS) \uc9d1\uc801 \ud68c\ub85c(IC)\uc758 \uad6c\uc870 \uc778\uc2dd \uc785\ub825/\ucd9c\ub825(I/O) \ud558\uc704 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 AMS-IO-Agent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900\uc758 AMS IC \uc124\uacc4 \uacb0\uacfc\ubb3c\uacfc \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While the field has evolved with diverse methods, this rapid surge in diverse methodologies has culminated in a fragmented research landscape. The lack of a unified framework, including inconsistent implementations, conflicting dependencies, and varying evaluation protocols, makes fair comparison and reproducible research increasingly difficult. To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment. Meanwhile, leveraging this unified framework, we systematically identify and investigate three implicit assumptions prevalent in mainstream evaluation: (1) offline data accessibility, (2) unregulated memory resources, and (3) intra-task semantic homogeneity. We argue that these assumptions often overestimate the real-world applicability of CL methods. Through our comprehensive analysis using strict online CL settings, a novel unified memory budget protocol, and a proposed category-randomized setting, we reveal significant performance drops in many representative CL methods when subjected to these real-world constraints. Our study underscores the necessity of resource-aware and semantically robust CL strategies, and offers LibContinual as a foundational toolkit for future research in realistic continual learning.

Submit number is 7597 and the paper is archived on the workshop website: https://visxgenai.github.io/subs-2025/7597/7597-doc.pdf", "summary": "Automating end-to-end data science pipeline with AI agents still stalls on two gaps: generating insightful, diverse visual evidence and assembling it into a coherent, professional report. We present A2P-Vis, a two-part, multi-agent pipeline that turns raw datasets into a high-quality data-visualization report. The Data Analyzer orchestrates profiling, proposes diverse visualization directions, generates and executes plotting code, filters low-quality figures with a legibility checker, and elicits candidate insights that are automatically scored for depth, correctness, specificity, depth and actionability. The Presenter then orders topics, composes chart-grounded narratives from the top-ranked insights, writes justified transitions, and revises the document for clarity and consistency, yielding a coherent, publication-ready report. Together, these agents convert raw data into curated materials (charts + vetted insights) and into a readable narrative without manual glue work. We claim that by coupling a quality-assured Analyzer with a narrative Presenter, A2P-Vis operationalizes co-analysis end-to-end, improving the real-world usefulness of automated data analysis for practitioners.

While these systems enable powerful new capabilities, increasing autonomy introduces critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing agentic AI implementations often emphasize functionality and scalability, yet provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions. This paper presents a Responsible(RAI) and Explainable(XAI) AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. In the proposed design, a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from a shared input context, explicitly exposing uncertainty, disagreement, and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent then performs structured consolidation across these outputs, enforcing safety and policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations and bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions. Explainability is achieved through explicit cross-model comparison and preserved intermediate outputs, while responsibility is enforced through centralized reasoning-layer control and agent-level constraints. We evaluate the architecture across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains. This work provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are autonomous and scalable, yet responsible and explainable by construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference.

However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, SAGA\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "SAGA\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub8e8\ud504\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc774\uc911 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud56d\uc0dd\uc81c \uc124\uacc4, \ubb34\uae30 \uc7ac\ub8cc \uc124\uacc4 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa9\ud45c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uba74 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\ub840 \uc5c6\ub294 \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uacfc\ud559\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ubaa9\uc801 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac\ubb3c\uc77c \ubfd0\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uac00 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ucda9\uc871\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc790\uc728 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent, SAGA)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets. We introduce SpatialBench, a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects. SpatialBench serves both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpatialBench\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\uc11d \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c 146\uac1c\uc758 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub85c, \uacf5\uac04 \uc804\uc0ac\uccb4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c AI\uc758 \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacf5\uac04 \uc804\uc0ac\uccb4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\uc11d \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c 146\uac1c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \uacf5\uac04 \uae30\uc220 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc94\uc8fc \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud504\ub860\ud2f0\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub0ae\uace0(\ubaa8\ub378 \uacc4\uc5f4 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 20-38%), \ubaa8\ub378-\uc791\uc5c5 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378-\ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uac15\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SpatialBench\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uacf5\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uce21\uc815 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc774\uc790 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ub80c\uc988 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacf5\uac04 \uc804\uc0ac\uccb4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc804\uc120 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\ubd84\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uacf5\uac04 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \uc77c\uacf1 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc94\uc8fc\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\uc11d \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c 146\uac1c\uc758 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 SpatialBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ubd84\uc11d \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc9c1\uc804\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc2a4\ub0c5\uc0f7\uacfc \uc8fc\uc694 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ucc44\uc810\uae30\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc804\uc120 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub0ae\uace0(\ubaa8\ub378 \uacc4\uc5f4 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 20-38%), \ubaa8\ub378-\uc791\uc5c5 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378-\ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uac15\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ud070 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \ub3c4\uad6c, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 1\uae09 \uac1d\uccb4\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uace0 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.
