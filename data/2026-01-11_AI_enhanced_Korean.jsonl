Yet, a comprehensive and live evaluation of their forecasting performance on real-world, research-oriented tasks in high-stakes domains (e.g., finance) remains underexplored. We introduce FinDeepForecast, the first live, end-to-end multi-agent system for automatically evaluating DR agents by continuously generating research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. This system is equipped with a dual-track taxonomy, enabling the dynamic generation of recurrent and non-recurrent forecasting tasks at both corporate and macro levels. With this system, we generate FinDeepForecastBench, a weekly evaluation benchmark over a ten-week horizon, encompassing 8 global economies and 1,314 listed companies, and evaluate 13 representative methods. Extensive experiments show that, while DR agents consistently outperform strong baselines, their performance still falls short of genuine forward-looking financial reasoning. We expect the proposed FinDeepForecast system to consistently facilitate future advancements of DR agents in research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. The benchmark and leaderboard are publicly available on the OpenFinArena Platform.", "AI": {"tldr": "DR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc73c\ub098, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 FinDeepForecast\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "DR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "FinDeepForecast\ub294 \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc608\uce21 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec DR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc804\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc7ac\ubb34 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\ub294 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FinDeepForecast \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud5a5\ud6c4 DR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\uae09 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\ub85c \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc5f0\uad6c(DR) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\ub294 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778(\uc608: \uae08\uc735)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubbf8\ube44\ud558\uac8c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 FinDeepForecast\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uac70\uc2dc \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \ubc0f \ube44\ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ud2b8\ub799 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uac16\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4 8\uac1c \uacbd\uc81c\uc640 1,314\uac1c \uc0c1\uc7a5 \ud68c\uc0ac\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 10\uc8fc \uae30\uac04\uc758 \uc8fc\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc778 FinDeepForecastBench\ub97c \uc0dd\ub3d9\uac10 \uc788\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 13\uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 DR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc804\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc7ac\ubb34 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\ub294 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c FinDeepForecast \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c DR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uacfc \ub9ac\ub354\ubcf4\ub4dc\ub294 OpenFinArena \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac1c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Centralised archi-tectures, though widely used, pose privacy and scalabil-ity challenges due to the aggregation of sensitive biomet-ric data. Decentralised identity frameworks offer better data sovereignty and eliminate single points of failure but introduce new security concerns, particularly around mu-tual trust among distributed devices. In such environments, biometric sensors and verification agents must authenticate one another before sharing sensitive biometric data. Ex-isting authentication schemes rely on classical public key infrastructure, which is increasingly susceptible to quan-tum attacks. This work addresses this gap by propos-ing a quantum-secure communication protocol for decen-tralised biometric systems, built upon an enhanced Quan-tum Key Distribution (QKD) system. The protocol incorpo-rates quantum-resilient authentication at both the classical and quantum layers of QKD: post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is used to secure the classical channel, while authen-tication qubits verify the integrity of the quantum channel. Once trust is established, QKD generates symmetric keys for encrypting biometric data in transit. Qiskit-based sim-ulations show a key generation rate of 15 bits/sec and 89% efficiency. This layered, quantum-resilient approach offers scalable, robust authentication for next-generation smart city infrastructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc591\uc790 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc778\uc99d\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uccb4 \uc778\uc99d\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc758 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc811\uadfc\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc591\uc790 \ud0a4 \ubc30\ud3ec(QKD) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc704\uc5d0 \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uc591\uc790 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uace0\uc804 \ubc0f \uc591\uc790 QKD\uc758 \ub450 \uce35\uc5d0\uc11c \uc591\uc790 \uc800\ud56d \uc778\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Qiskit \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd08\ub2f9 15\ube44\ud2b8\uc758 \ud0a4 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 89%\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc591\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uc591\uc790 \uc800\ud56d \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc778\uc99d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uccb4 \uc778\uc99d\uc740 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4, \uc6b4\uc1a1 \ubc0f \uacf5\uacf5 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc0dd\uccb4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uc2e0\uc6d0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc8fc\uad8c\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc7a5\uce58 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc13c\uc11c\uc640 \uac80\uc99d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc0dd\uccb4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc778\uc99d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc778\uc99d \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uac1c \ud0a4 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc591\uc790 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac15\ud654\ub41c \uc591\uc790 \ud0a4 \ubd84\ubc30(QKD) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc591\uc790 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uace0\uc804 \ucc44\ub110\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790 \uc554\ud638\ud559(PQC)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uc99d \ud050\ube44\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc591\uc790 \ucc44\ub110\uc758 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uc800\ud56d \uc778\uc99d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ub8b0\uac00 \uad6c\ucd95\ub418\uba74 QKD\ub294 \uc0dd\uccb4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc804\uc1a1 \uc911 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\uce6d \ud0a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Cybersecurity programs often fail to equip graduates with skills demanded by the workforce, particularly concerning recent developments in cybersecurity, as curriculum design is costly and labor-intensive. To address this misalignment, we present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for automated design and analysis of cybersecurity curricula, called CurricuLLM. Our approach provides three key contributions: (1) automation of personalized curriculum design, (2) a data-driven pipeline aligned with industry demands, and (3) a comprehensive methodology for leveraging fine-tuned LLMs in curriculum development.\n  CurricuLLM utilizes a two-tier approach consisting of PreprocessLM, which standardizes input data, and ClassifyLM, which assigns course content to nine Knowledge Areas in cybersecurity. We systematically evaluated multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures and fine-tuning strategies, ultimately selecting the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model as ClassifyLM, fine-tuned on foundational cybersecurity concepts and workforce competencies.\n  We are the first to validate our method with human experts who analyzed real-world cybersecurity curricula and frameworks, motivating that CurricuLLM is an efficient solution to replace labor-intensive curriculum analysis. Moreover, once course content has been classified, it can be integrated with established cybersecurity role-based weights, enabling alignment of the educational program with specific job roles, workforce categories, or general market needs. This lays the foundation for personalized, workforce-aligned cybersecurity curricula that prepare students for the evolving demands in cybersecurity.", "AI": {"tldr": "CurricuLLM\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uad50\uc721 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uac1c\uc778 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uc124\uacc4, \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc218\uc694\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc218\uc815\ub41c LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc774 \uc878\uc5c5\uc0dd\uc5d0\uac8c \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "CurricuLLM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 PreprocessLM\uacfc ClassifyLM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec, \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uacfc\uc815 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \uc544\ud649 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0 \ud560\ub2f9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "BERT \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 ClassifyLM\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ubc1b\uc558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CurricuLLM\uc740 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c, \uad50\uc721 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc9c1\ubb34 \uc5ed\ud560 \ubc0f \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc218\uc694\uc640 \uc815\ub82c\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138\ud654\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub04a\uc784\uc5c6\uc774 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc878\uc5c5\uc0dd\uc5d0\uac8c \ub178\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CurricuLLM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uac1c\uc778 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654, (2) \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc218\uc694\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778, (3) \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ub41c LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860.

Such representations lack explicit modular structure, limiting behavioral interpretation. We investigate whether programmatic policies (PERL), implemented as soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL), can match the performance of NERL. To support reproducible evaluation, we provide the first fully specified and open-source reimplementation of the classic 1992 Artificial Life (ALife) ERL testbed. We conduct a rigorous survival analysis across 4000 independent trials utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) metrics absent in the original study. We find a statistically significant difference in survival probability between PERL and NERL. PERL agents survive on average 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents. Moreover, SDDL agents using learning alone (no evolution) survive on average 73.67 steps longer than neural agents using both learning and evaluation.

We present a next-generation mobile nutrition assistant that combines image based meal logging with an LLM driven multi agent controller to provide meal level closed loop support. The system coordinates vision, dialogue and state management agents to estimate nutrients from photos and update a daily intake budget.

By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code. Our approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods.

To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift towards subgoal-level evaluation and learning. We first construct GeoGoal, a benchmark synthesized via a rigorous formal verification data engine, which converts abstract proofs into verifiable numeric subgoals. This structure reveals a critical divergence between reasoning quality and outcome accuracy. Leveraging this, we propose the Sub-Goal Verifiable Reward (SGVR) framework, which replaces sparse signals with dense rewards based on the Skeleton Rate.

Despite over 2.5 million scientific papers published annually, the figure generation process remains largely manual. We introduce $\\textbf{SciFig}$, an end-to-end AI agent system that generates publication-ready pipeline figures directly from research paper texts. SciFig uses a hierarchical layout generation strategy, which parses research descriptions to identify component relationships, groups related elements into functional modules, and generates inter-module connections to establish visual organization. Furthermore, an iterative chain-of-thought (CoT) feedback mechanism progressively improves layouts through multiple rounds of visual analysis and reasoning. We introduce a rubric-based evaluation framework that analyzes 2,219 real scientific figures to extract evaluation rubrics and automatically generates comprehensive evaluation criteria. SciFig demonstrates remarkable performance: achieving 70.1$\\%$ overall quality on dataset-level evaluation and 66.2$\\%$ on paper-specific evaluation, and consistently high scores across metrics such as visual clarity, structural organization, and scientific accuracy.

This paper demonstrates the value of LLMs in psychological measurement by (1) compiling the first large-scale dataset of election rumors on a niche alt-tech platform, (2) developing a multistage Rumor Detection Agent that leverages LLMs for high-precision content classification, and (3) quantifying the psychological dynamics of rumor propagation, specifically the \"illusory truth effect\" in a naturalistic setting. The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks.

However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uba40\ud2f0

However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods. Additionally, the probability of reward hacking problem in TNT's responses, which are classified as not using thinking, remains below 10% across all tested datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc57d 50%\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRM)\uc740 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub098, \uae34 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TNT \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5(SFT)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \ud574\uacb0\uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ube44\uc0ac\uace0\uc801 \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \ucd5c\ub300 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc218\ud559 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c TNT\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc57d 50%\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9 \uac10\uc18c\uc640 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TNT\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud574\ud0b9 \ubb38\uc81c \ud655\ub960\uc744 10% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRM)\uc740 \uadf8 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815(Chain of Thought, CoT)\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc778\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uace0\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud560\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd88\ud589\ud788\ub3c4, RL\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud574\ud0b9 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uba70, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uc73c\ub098 \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815(SFT)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ube44\uc0ac\uace0\uc801 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070 \ud55c\ub3c4\ub97c \ubd80\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0 \uae30\ubc18 \ube44\uc0ac\uace0(Thinking-Based Non-Thinking, TNT)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce T-Retriever, a novel framework that reformulates attributed graph retrieval as tree-based retrieval using a semantic and structure-guided encoding tree. Our approach features two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Compression Encoding, which replaces artificial compression quotas with a global optimization strategy that preserves the graph's natural hierarchical organization, and (2) Semantic-Structural Entropy ($S^2$-Entropy), which jointly optimizes for both structural cohesion and semantic consistency when creating hierarchical partitions.

While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc544\ub78d\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c LLM\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \ubc0f \ub300\ub9ac \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc804\uc6a9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \uc18c\uac1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc2dc \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 5-10% \uac10\uc18c\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc544\ub78d\uc5b4 \uc6d0\uc5b4\ubbfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc740 \uc601\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc544\ub78d\uc5b4\ub85c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc544\ub78d\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \ubc0f \ub300\ub9ac \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc544\ub78d\uc5b4\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ud3c9\uade0 5-10% \uac10\uc18c\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc544\ub78d\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\ud3c9\ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc774\uc81c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\ubd88\uac00\uacb0\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\ub78d\uc5b4 \uc6d0\uc5b4\ubbfc LLM\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ub4a4\uccd0\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc601\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc694\ud55c\ub370 \uac04\uacfc\ub41c \uc601\uc5ed\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\ub85c, \uc544\ub78d\uc5b4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ube44\uc601\uc5b4 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc601\uc5b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub354\uc6b1 \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc544\ub78d\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \ubc0f \ub300\ub9ac \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc804\uc6a9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacf5\ubc31\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc544\ub78d\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc544\ub78d\uc5b4\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ud3c9\uade0 5-10% \uac10\uc18c\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ub9c9\ub300\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc870\uba85\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc544\ub78d\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub354\uc6b1 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\ud3c9\ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to \\textit{Memory Anchoring}, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs. We then propose \\textbf{Stee}rable \\textbf{M}emory Agent, \\texttt{SteeM}, a framework that allows users to dynamically regulate memory reliance, ranging from a fresh-start mode that promotes innovation to a high-fidelity mode that closely follows interaction history. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking strategies, yielding a more nuanced and effective control for personalized human-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uc640 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub204\uc801 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uc5b5 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc808\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 Steerable Memory Agent(\uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uace0\uc815 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uc804\ub7b5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc778\uac04-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ub204\uc801 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \"\ubaa8\ub450 \ub610\ub294 \uc804\ud600\" \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uad00\ub828 \uacfc\uac70 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba74 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacfc\uac70 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc5bd\ud788\ub294 '\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uace0\ucc29'\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ubc30\uc81c\ud558\uba74 \uacfc\uc18c \ud65c\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uacfc\uac70 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ud604\uc7ac \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uc120\ud55c \uc2dc\uc791 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \ub530\ub974\ub294 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc808\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 Steerable Memory Agent(\uc904\uc5ec\uc11c SteeM) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc778\uac04-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Rather than relying on synthetic prompts, tasks are elicited from formative and summative co-play with expert players, normalized into parametric templates with explicit preconditions and dependency structure, and paired with machine-checkable validators under a bounded-knowledge policy that forbids out-of-world shortcuts. The harness captures plan/act/memory events-including plan previews, targeted clarifications, memory reads and writes, precondition checks, and repair attempts and reports outcomes relative to the total number of attempted subtasks, derived from in-world evidence.\n  As an initial snapshot, we instantiate the framework with GPT-4o and evaluate \\textbf{216} subtasks across \\textbf{8} experienced players. We observe recurring breakdown patterns in code execution, inventory/tool handling, referencing, and navigation, alongside recoveries supported by mixed-initiative clarifications and lightweight memory. Participants rated interaction quality and interface usability positively, while highlighting the need for stronger memory persistence across tasks. We release the complete task suite, validators, logs, and harness to support transparent, reproducible evaluation of future memory-aware embodied agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8
