We point\nout two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity;\nsusceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former\nthreat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex\nmulti-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to\nintegrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented\nboth of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to\nfacilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also\ndemonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing\nimprovements up to more than 16\\%.

How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow\nconditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents\na data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to\noptimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater\nsystem, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case\nstudy. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate\nprofiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -\nleveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR\nfactorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes\nbased on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the\nrepresentativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the\nDSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three\noptimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction\nperformance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to\n75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty\nin measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and\nimproves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances\ncomputational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy\nflow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further\nintegrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time\ncontrol under limited sensing and monitoring resource."}

To this end,\nwe develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system\nthat mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given\nthe baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,\nformulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous\nexperimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous\napproaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI\nScientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding\nagents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically\nvaluable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments\nusing AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,\na venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings\ndemonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review\nscores than existing fully automated systems.

WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration", "comment": null, "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies."}

Among the various forms\nof user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community\nparticipation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments\nthat are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting\nstylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.\nWe introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for\ncontrollable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video\nsegmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt\nconstruction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),\nrhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content\nextraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM\ndirectly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through\nexplicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and\nevaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin\n(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy\nskits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk\nshows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style\nconformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and\n105 participants.

To address the second threat, we offer to\nintegrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented\nboth of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to\nfacilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents.

Although recent theoretical studies have\nestablished the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for\ntransformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,\nthe current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head\nattention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this\ngap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.\nWe prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension\n$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it\ncontains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input\ndimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for\nMHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We\nempirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the\napproximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)\nand an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the\nhidden dimension of the source model."}
